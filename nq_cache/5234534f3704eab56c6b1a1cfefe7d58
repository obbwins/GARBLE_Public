A devil sat at the top of the Washington Square arch where it released balloons and slid down a wire into the fountain . The year also saw the first appearance of giant spider on the Jefferson Market Library . </Li> <Li> 1985 - With crowds expanding to 250,000 , the route was moved from side streets to Sixth Avenue from Spring Street to 22nd Street ( although in practice the gathering point was further south at Canal Street and the northern point would be shortened to 16th Street . The change in route ended the connection to Washington Square Park . Jeanne Fleming took over managing the event . The change with its barricades also reduced the possibilities of people joining the parade at any point as had been the case . </Li> <Li> 1990 - New York University and Manhattan Community Board 2 begin hosting an unrelated Children 's Halloween Parade in Greenwich Village in the afternoons n Washington Square . </Li> <Li> 1998 - Sophia Michahelles and Alex Kahn become the official designers of the parade 's puppets . </Li> <Li> 1999 - Basil Twist designs the spider that currently appears on the Jefferson Market Library . </Li> <Li> 2001 - Less than seven weeks after the September 11 attacks the parade was broadcast worldwide and was an indication that New York was bouncing back . The parade was led by a giant puppet of a Phoenix rising out of the ashes . Noticeably missing from the parade was Bread and Puppet Theater which had been a political staple of the parade but was protesting the new War in Afghanistan . </Li> </Ul> <P> Earlier the Bread and Puppet contingent consisted of five blocks of its giant puppets . </P> <Ul> <Li> 2005 - Less than 8 weeks after Hurricane Katrina more than 8,000 storm evacuees attended a funeral procession tribute as part of the parade . </Li> <Li> 2010 - Haitian Carnival Artist Didier Civil created Haitian carnival figures as a tribute to victims of the 2010 Haiti earthquake . </Li> <Li> 2012 - The parade was cancelled for its only time in the aftermath Hurricane Sandy which had heavily damaged coastal New York City and had left Greenwich without electricity during the parade time . </Li> <Li> 2013 - A Kickstarter campaign to cover costs of the 2012 closing saved the parade from permanently closing . The campaign raised $56,000 and had a goal of $50,000 . </Li> <Li> 2017 - Less than four hours after Sayfullo Saipov killed 8 people six blocks west of the parade route in the 2017 Lower Manhattan attack the parade proceded as sheduled . Both Mayor Bill de Blasio and Gov.

Celebration artist Jeanne Fleming , the parade 's artistic and producing director Twenty - foot illuminated caterpillars -- animated pageant sized puppets designed by Alex Kahn of Superior Concept Monsters -- transform Manhattan 's Greenwich Village in 1998 . An incandescent baby phoenix conceived and designed by Sophia Michahelles of Superior Concept Monsters rises from fiery ashes to new life in 2001 , after the September 11 attacks . Finishing touches are made to a giant dinosaur puppet in the staging area on parade day . <P> In 2001 , the parade presented a work of puppetry that would become celebrated for its artistry , and remembered in the city 's history . After terrorists struck Lower Manhattan on September 11 , 2001 , events citywide and nationwide were being cancelled . Organizers believed the parade would give the city a much - needed emotional release , reform the community , and help it to begin the healing process . They felt that this was the most positive way they , as artists , could serve the city at such a desperate time . `` This is the meaning of the Dancing Skeletons that always lead the march : they know better than anyone what they have lost , and so they dance this one night of the year to celebrate life , '' Fleming told CNN in an interview . </P> <P> By September 15 , Fleming had scrapped the old theme and chosen a new one . Although no one was certain the parade would take place , designer Sophia Michahelles conceived of a new theme , Phoenix Rising , to galvanize the spirit of New York in the wake of the tragedy . A giant puppet of a phoenix , the mythical bird that rises up out of its own ashes , was created by Michahelles in the workshop of Official Parade Puppeteers Superior Concept Monsters . The animated creation was mechanically configured to spread its wings and rise out of fiery ashes , represented by flickering lanterns lifted on poles , encircling the parading figure . On October 25 the parade received final authorization to go ahead . In light of the widely established community relationships which Fleming had cultivated , and the parade 's long tradition , Mayor Rudy Giuliani insisted it go on . </P> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ Village Halloween Parade . `` History of the Parade '' .
