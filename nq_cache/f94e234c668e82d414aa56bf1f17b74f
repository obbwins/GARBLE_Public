The board was originally very ineffective , perhaps because authority was shared by all eight members of the board rather than any single point person . In 1949 , this was changed on the recommendation of the Hoover Commission . All power was vested in the chairman alone , and the board was moved to be part of the Department of Defense . Later , it was shifted to the Executive Office of the President . Its role was later eliminated when its responsibilities were transferred to the Office of Defense Mobilization in June 1953 . </P> <H2> Mission ( edit ) </H2> <P> The organization had the following statutory duties : </P> <Ul> <Li> policies concerning industrial and civilian mobilization in order to assure the most effective mobilization and maximum utilization of the Nation 's manpower in the event of war . </Li> <Li> programs for the effective use in time of war of the Nation 's natural and industrial resources for military and civilian needs , for the maintenance and stabilization of the civilian economy in time of war , and for the adjustment of such economy to war needs and conditions ; </Li> <Li> policies for unifying , in time of war , the activities of Federal agencies and departments engaged in or concerned with production , procurement , distribution , or transportation of military or civilian supplies , materials , and products ; </Li> <Li> the relationship between potential supplies of , and potential requirements for , manpower , resources , and productive facilities in time of war ; </Li> <Li> policies for establishing adequate reserves of strategic and critical material , and for the conservation of these reserves ; </Li> <Li> the strategic relocation of industries , services , government , and economic activities , the continuous operation of which is essential to the Nation 's security . </Li> </Ul> <H2> Structure ( edit ) </H2> <P> The board was composed of eight members , one of whom served as its chairman . </P> <P> In addition , at the time of its creation , the chairman of the National Security Resources Board also served ex officio as one of only seven permanent members of the National Security Council .
