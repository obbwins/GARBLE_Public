Some stores featured genuine Alaskan totem poles in front of the store . In 1946 , the chain 's name was changed from `` Tote 'm '' to `` 7 - Eleven '' to reflect the company 's new , extended hours , 7 : 00 am to 11 : 00 pm , seven days per week . In November 1999 , the corporate name of the US company was changed from `` The Southland Corporation '' to `` 7 - Eleven Inc . '' </P> <H2> History ( edit ) </H2> <P> In 1927 , Southland Ice Company employee John Jefferson Green began selling eggs , milk , and bread from one of 16 ice house storefronts in Dallas , with permission from one of Southland 's founding directors , Joe C. Thompson , Sr. Although small grocery stores and general merchandisers were available , Thompson theorized that selling products such as bread and milk in convenience stores would reduce the need for customers to travel long distances for basic items . He eventually bought the Southland Ice Company and turned it into Southland Corporation , which oversaw several locations in the Dallas area . </P> <P> In 1928 , Jenna Lira brought a totem pole as a souvenir from Alaska and placed it in front of the store . The pole served as a marketing tool for the company , as it attracted a great deal of attention . Soon , executives added totem poles in front of every store and eventually adopted an Alaska Native - inspired theme for their stores . Later on , the stores began operating under the name `` Tote 'm Stores '' . In the same year , the company began constructing gasoline stations in some of its Dallas locations as an experiment . Joe Thompson also provided a distinct characteristic to the company 's stores , training the staff so that people would receive the same quality and service in every store . Southland also started to have a uniform for its ice station service boys . This became the major factor in the company 's success as a retail convenience store . </P> <P> In 1931 , the Great Depression affected the company , sending it toward bankruptcy . Nevertheless , the company continued its operations through re-organization and receivership . A Dallas banker , W.W. Overton Jr. , also helped to revive the company 's finances by selling the company 's bonds for seven cents on the dollar . This brought the company 's ownership under the control of a board of directors . </P> <P> In 1946 , in an effort to continue the company 's post-war recovery , the name of the franchise was changed to 7 - Eleven to reflect the stores ' new hours of operation ( 7 am to 11 pm ) , which were unprecedented at the time . In 1963 , 7 - Eleven experimented with a 24 - hour schedule in Austin , Texas , after an Austin store stayed open all night to satisfy customer demand . Later on , 24 - hour stores were established in Fort Worth and Dallas , Texas , as well as Las Vegas , Nevada . In 1971 , Southland acquired convenience stores of the former Pak - A-Sak chain owned by Graham Allen Penniman , Sr. ( 1903 -- 1985 ) , of Shreveport , Louisiana . </P> Play media Inside a Florida - based 7 - Eleven store in 1987 . <P> With the purchase in 1964 of 126 Speedee Mart franchised convenience stores in California , the company entered the franchise business . The company signed its first area licensing agreement in 1968 with Garb - Ko , Inc. of Saginaw , Michigan , which became the first US domestic area 7 - Eleven licensee . </P> <P> In the late 1980s , Southland Corporation was threatened by a rumored corporate takeover , prompting the Thompson family to take steps to convert the company into a private model by buying out public shareholders in a tender offer . In December 1987 , John Philp Thompson , the chairman and CEO of 7 - Eleven , completed a $5.2 billion management buyout of the company . The buyout suffered from the effects of the 1987 stock market crash and after failing initially to raise high yield debt financing , the company was required to offer a portion of stock as an inducement to invest in the company 's bonds . </P> <P> Various assets , such as the Chief Auto Parts chain , the ice division , and hundreds of store locations , were sold between 1987 and 1990 to relieve debt incurred during the buyout . This downsizing also resulted in numerous metropolitan areas losing 7 - Eleven stores to rival convenience store operators . In October 1990 , the heavily indebted Southland Corp. filed a pre-packaged Chapter 11 bankruptcy in order to transfer control of 70 % of the company to Japanese affiliate Ito - Yokado . </P> <P> Southland exited bankruptcy in March 1991 , after a cash infusion of $430 million from Ito - Yokado and Seven - Eleven Japan . These two Japanese entities now controlled 70 % of the company , with the founding Thompson family retaining 5 % . In 1999 , Southland Corp. changed its name to 7 - Eleven , Inc. , citing the divestment of operations other than 7 - Eleven . Ito - Yokado formed Seven & I Holdings Co. and 7 - Eleven became its subsidiary in 2005 . In 2007 , Seven & I Holdings announced that it would be expanding its American operations , with an additional 1,000 7 - Eleven stores in the United States . </P> <P> For the 2010 rankings , 7 - Eleven climbed to the No. 3 spot in Entrepreneur Magazine 's 31st Annual Franchise 500 , `` the first and most comprehensive ranking in the world '' . This was the 17th year 7 - Eleven was named in the top 10 . </P> <P> Also in 2010 , the first `` green '' 7 - Eleven store opened in DeLand , Florida . The store features U.S. Green Building Council 's ( USGBC ) Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design ( LEED ) elements . Also , the environmentally - friendly design brings the store savings in energy costs . That same year , 7 - Eleven went mobile with the launch of the iconic Slurpee drink 's iPhone and Android Application ( App ) . The Slurpee drink app made it easy to find 7 - Eleven stores and provides driving directions . The following year , 7 - Eleven celebrated its 40,000 th store opening and within two years of that milestone opened its 50,000 th store . </P> <H2> Products and services ( edit ) </H2> 1.2 - liter ( 41 U.S. fl oz ) Super Big Gulp <P> 7 - Eleven in the United States sells Slurpee drinks , a partially frozen soft drink introduced in 1965 ( Oklahoma 's stores are known as Icee Drink ) , and Big Gulp beverages , introduced in 1976 . Other products include : 7 - Select private - brand products , coffee , fresh - made daily sandwiches , fresh fruit , salads , bakery items , hot and prepared foods , gasoline , dairy products , carbonated beverages and energy drinks , juices , financial services , and product delivery services . </P> <P> 7 - Eleven is known for its relatively large drink sizes . 7 - Eleven offers beverages that are 32 ounces ( 946ml ) ( Big Gulp ) , 44 U.S. fluid ounces ( 1.301 L ) ( Super Big Gulp ) , 53 ounces ( 1567ml ) ( X-Treme Gulp ) , 64 ounces ( 1893ml ) ( Double Gulp ) , or 128 ounces ( 3785ml ) ( Team Gulp ) , as well as the 20 ounce Gulp . These beverage sizes were all among the largest sold soft drinks when they were introduced . 7 - Eleven has often been associated with these large sodas in popular culture . For example , Mayor Michael Bloomberg 's proposed ban on large sodas in New York City was frequently referred to as the ' Big Gulp ban ' . </P> <P> In 2012 , 7 - Eleven changed the size of the Double Gulp from 64 ounces to 50 ounces ( 1478ml ) . The older style cups were too wide at the bottom and did not fit beverage holders in cars . This was not a reaction to the large soda ban proposal , according to a spokesperson . </P> <H2> Global operations ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Asia ( edit ) </H3> Hong Kong ( edit ) 7 - Eleven in Shek Tong Tsui , Hong Kong <P> 7 - Eleven first opened in Hong Kong in 1981 , and today operates as a subsidiary of the Dairy Farm .

All 7 - Eleven stores in Hong Kong accept the ubiquitous Octopus card as a method of payment . They also accept payments for utility bills and public housing rent . </P> <P> In November 1980 , Southland Corporation and Hong Kong conglomerate Jardine Matheson signed a franchise agreement to bring 7 - Eleven to the territory . The first 7 - Eleven shop opened in Happy Valley on 3 April 1981 . The chain expanded aggressively across Hong Kong throughout the 1980s . The 50th store opened in Kwai Chung on 6 October 1983 , while the 200th was inaugurated by Simon Keswick at Tai Po Centre on 7 May 1987 . The stores were sold to Dairy Farm , part of the Jardine Matheson group , in 1989 . </P> <P> Octopus card readers were introduced in all 7 - Eleven stores in July 1999 , although at first these could only be used to add value to the card . In September 2004 , the number of locations in Hong Kong was substantially boosted when Dairy Farm acquired Daily Stop , a rival convenience store chain , from SCMP Retailing ( HK ) . The chain 's 84 shops , located mainly in MTR and Kowloon -- Canton Railway stations ( as well as shopping centres and housing estates ) , were converted to 7 - Eleven stores . </P> <P> In 2009 , a 7 - Eleven location in Quarry Bay opened with a hot food counter , called `` 7 Caf\u00e9 '' , selling traditional Hong Kong street food and milk tea . This feature was subsequently extended to select other 7 - Eleven locations across Hong Kong under the `` Daily Caf\u00e9 '' and `` Hot Shot '' brands . </P> Indonesia ( edit ) <P> In 2008 , 7 - Eleven announced plans to expand its business in Indonesia through a master franchise agreement with Modern Sevel Indonesia and Media Nusantara Citra .

In South Australia all Mobil petrol stations were sold to Peregrine Corporation and branded as On the Run petrol stations . </P> <P> 7 - Eleven stores in Australia sell a wide range of items , including daily newspapers , drinks , confectionery , and snack foods . They sell gift cards , including three types of pre-paid Visa cards . The chain has partnered with BankWest , placing a BankWest ATM in each of their stores nationwide . Each year on November 7 , 7 - Eleven promotes `` 7 - Eleven Day '' by giving away a free Slurpee to customers . </P> <P> In April 2014 , 7 - Eleven announced plans to start operating stores in Western Australia , with 11 stores planned to operate within the first year and a total of 75 stores established within five years . The first store was opened on October 30 , 2014 in the city of Fremantle . The country has 675 stores as of January 2018 . </P> Wage theft ( edit ) <P> In August 2015 , Fairfax Media and the ABC 's Four Corners programme reported on the employment practices of certain 7 - Eleven franchisees in Australia . The investigation found that many 7 - Eleven employees were being underpaid at rates of around A $ 10 to A $14 per hour before tax , well under the legally - required minimum award rate of A $24.69 per hour . </P> <P> Franchisees underpaying their staff would typically maintain rosters and pay records that would appear to show the employee being paid the legally - required rate , however these records would in fact only include half of the hours the employee actually worked in a week . Employees would then be paid on the basis of these records , resulting in them effectively being paid half the legally - required rate . </P> <P> It was also reported that workers were often not paid loadings and penalty rates that they are legally entitled to , for working overtime hours , nights , weekends , and public holidays . </P> <P> After these reports came to light and received widespread attention , some employees had alleged to Fairfax Media that they had begun to be paid correctly through the 7 - Eleven payroll system , however would then be asked by the franchisee to pay back half their wages in cash . 7 - Eleven subsequently announced they would fund an inquiry to investigate instances of wage fraud . The inquiry is to be conducted by an independent panel chaired by former Australian Competition and Consumer Commission chairman Allan Fels , and with the support of professional services firm Deloitte . The inquiry invited submissions from current and former 7 - Eleven employees who allege they have been underpaid , and assess each individual claim . </P> <P> In September 2015 , chairman Russ Withers and chief executive Warren Wilmon announced they would resign from the company . Deputy chairman Michael Smith replaced Withers , while Bob Baily was appointed as interim chief executive . </P> <P> The Four Corners investigation into 7 - Eleven won a Walkley Award in 2015 . In December 2015 , Stewart Levitt of law firm Levitt Robinson Solicitors , who featured prominently in the Four Corners program , announced a potential class action lawsuit against 7 - Eleven head office on behalf of franchisees who had allegedly been lured into signing on with 7 - Eleven by false representations . </P> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Companies portal </Li> </Ul> <Ul> <Li> List of convenience stores </Li> </Ul> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ `` 7 - Eleven around the world '' .
