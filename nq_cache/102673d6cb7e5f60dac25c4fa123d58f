She faces a dilemma when her fianc\u00e9 returns to her life . </P> <P> The eighties marked a professional setback in Chopra 's career , as several films he directed and produced in that period were critical and commercial failures . After a series of failed action movies , Chopra decided to return to his roots and make a romantic musical , a film with all the hallmarks of what has come to be known as the `` Yash Chopra style '' : heroine - oriented , romantic , emotional , depicting the lifestyle of the super elite , with melodic music used in songs picturised in foreign locations . The film marked the first collaboration between Chopra and Sridevi . Upon release , Chandni received widespread critical acclaim and was a major commercial success , grossing \u20b9 80.5 million , becoming the fourth - highest - grossing film of 1989 . The huge success of the film and its soundtrack were instrumental in ending the era of violent action films in Indian Cinema and rejuvenating the romantic musical genre .

Over the years , Chandni is hailed as one of the greatest Indian films of all time and one of Chopra 's finest movies . </P> <P> At the 37th National Film Awards , the film received the National Film Award for Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment . At the 35th Filmfare Awards , Chandni received 10 nominations including Best Film and winning Best Cinematography . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Plot </Li> <Li> 2 Cast </Li> <Li> 3 Music </Li> <Li> 4 Reception </Li> <Li> 5 Awards </Li> <Li> 6 References </Li> <Li> 7 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Plot ( edit ) </H2> <P> Rohit ( Rishi Kapoor ) meets Chandni ( Sridevi ) at a wedding of a relative and falls instantly in love with her and pursues her relentlessly until she agrees to date him .

According to iDiva , Chandni was `` more an event and less a movie . Even as its shooting rolled on the sets , the film was a constant subject of discussion in the press . '' Chandni emerged as one of the biggest blockbusters of 1989 with The Hindu stating that `` the film opened to full houses and distributors had to drastically increase the number of theatres . '' ' It was cited by Times of India as `` one of the most watched films of Indian Cinema . '' Hindustan Times featured the movie in its list of ' Yash Chopra 's Greatest Hits ' saying `` it was instrumental in ending the era of violence in Bollywood and bringing back the romance into Hindi films . '' </P> <P> The film consolidated Sridevi 's position as the top female star of the era . Describing Sridevi 's performance in Chandni , Indiatimes wrote `` True to her screen - name , she was an epitome of radiance , warmth and vivacity . She effortlessly introduced us to the powerful streaks , her classic , angelic character was laden with . '' The scene where she confronts Rishi Kapoor was ranked by Rediff as one of the `` Ten Best Scenes from Yash Chopra Films . '' While Sridevi topped the Hindustan Times ' list of Yash Chopra 's `` Top 5 Heroines , '' CNN - IBN ranked her no . 1 on its list of `` Yash Chopra 's 10 Most Sensuous Heroines , '' saying that `` Yash Chopra immortalised Sridevi as the perfect Chandni . '' </P> <P> The titular character became one of the most famous characters of Hindi cinema with India Today including it in its list of ' Yash Chopra 's Iconic Characters ' . CNN - IBN listed it among ' The Cult Characters Yash Chopra Created ' while NDTV featured it in its list of ' Yash Chopra 's Greatest Creations ' stating that the film established Sridevi `` as the nation 's sweetheart '' and `` reinforced her position as the reigning actress in Bollywood . '' </P> <P> Sridevi 's iconic ' Chandni Look ' revolutionized fashion in North India and became synonymous with the actress , with Rediff stating `` A luminous Sridevi slips into every possible design in white for a major chunk of the romance and no one complains . '' Speaking about the look , Yash Chopra told film critic Rajeev Masand `` While making Chandni , I had a vision of who I wanted this girl to be . I told Sridevi that most of her costumes in the film would be in white . '' The Tribune wrote `` Leena Daru scored a winner again when she created the ' Chandni Look ' for Sridevi . Every street corner sold the salwar - kameez and dupatta that gave the heroine a refreshingly understated look , rarely seen on the Indian screen . '' while Mid Day reported `` Leena Daru dressed Bollywood 's beauties for several years . But it was her simple white churidar and kurta with the leheriya dupatta for Sridevi in the film Chandni that gave the Southern belle an angelic image and caused the Chandni Chowk stores to hit the jackpot with thousands of copies . '' BizAsia described the effect of the look saying `` Chopra never quite got over his Sridevi hangover and almost always chose to present his lead heroines in similar outfits ( Juhi Chawla in Darr ( 1993 ) , Madhuri Dixit in Dil To Pagal Hai ( 1997 ) ) , but none of them became half as iconic as Sridevi did after Chandni . '' The ' Chandni Look ' was also highlighted in the film 's famous Tandav dance sequence by Sridevi , where Rediff said `` the actress transformed into a mythical goddess in a white number . '' Sridevi 's chiffons became equally popular with Indian Express writing `` This movie made the chiffon sari a must - have in every Indian woman 's wardrobe . '' </P> <P> The music of Chandni became a multi-Platinum success with Sridevi 's famous dance number `` Mere Hathon Mein Nau Nau Choodiyan Hain '' finding a place in the Rediff chart of ' Bollywood 's Top 25 Wedding Songs . ' The actress also lent her voice to the film 's popular title - track ' Chandni O Meri Chandni ' which featured among the ' Top 5 Songs ' of Yash Chopra by Hindustan Times . Talking about her role in Chandni , Sridevi said it was `` a lively and vibrant girl in the first half ( who ) becomes quiet and goes into a shell in the second half . I loved that transformation and when you have a director like Yash Chopra at the helm , you can be sure that he will make the best out of everything .
