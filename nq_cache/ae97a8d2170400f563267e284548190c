The area around the formation is home to an abundance of springs , waterholes , rock caves and ancient paintings . Uluru is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site .

This word is a proper noun , with no further particular meaning in the Pitjantjatjara dialect , although it is used as a local family name by the senior Traditional Owners of Uluru . </P> <P> On 19 July 1873 , the surveyor William Gosse sighted the landmark and named it Ayers Rock in honour of the then Chief Secretary of South Australia , Sir Henry Ayers . Since then , both names have been used . </P> <P> In 1993 , a dual naming policy was adopted that allowed official names that consist of both the traditional Aboriginal name and the English name . On 15 December 1993 , it was renamed `` Ayers Rock / Uluru '' and became the first official dual - named feature in the Northern Territory . The order of the dual names was officially reversed to `` Uluru / Ayers Rock '' on 6 November 2002 following a request from the Regional Tourism Association in Alice Springs . </P> <H2> Description </H2> <P> Uluru is one of Australia 's most recognisable natural landmarks . The sandstone formation stands 348 m ( 1,142 ft ) high , rising 863 m ( 2,831 ft ) above sea level with most of its bulk lying underground , and has a total circumference of 9.4 km ( 5.8 mi ) . Both Uluru and the nearby Kata Tjuta formation have great cultural significance for the A\u1e49angu people , the traditional inhabitants of the area , who lead walking tours to inform visitors about the local flora and fauna , bush food and the Aboriginal dreamtime stories of the area . </P> <P> Uluru is notable for appearing to change colour at different times of the day and year , most notably when it glows red at dawn and sunset . </P> <P> Kata Tjuta , also called Mount Olga or the Olgas , lies 25 km ( 16 mi ) west of Uluru . Special viewing areas with road access and parking have been constructed to give tourists the best views of both sites at dawn and dusk . </P> Panorama of Uluru around sunset , showing its distinctive red colouration at dusk . <H2> Geology </H2> Uluru rock formations Panorama from the top of Uluru , showing a typical gully Close - up view of Uluru 's surface , composed of arkose <P> Uluru is an inselberg , literally `` island mountain '' . An inselberg is a prominent isolated residual knob or hill that rises abruptly from and is surrounded by extensive and relatively flat erosion lowlands in a hot , dry region . Uluru is also often referred to as a monolith , although this is a somewhat ambiguous term that is generally avoided by geologists . The remarkable feature of Uluru is its homogeneity and lack of jointing and parting at bedding surfaces , leading to the lack of development of scree slopes and soil . These characteristics led to its survival , while the surrounding rocks were eroded . For the purpose of mapping and describing the geological history of the area , geologists refer to the rock strata making up Uluru as the Mutitjulu Arkose , and it is one of many sedimentary formations filling the Amadeus Basin . </P> <H3> Composition </H3> <P> Uluru is dominantly composed of coarse - grained arkose ( a type of sandstone characterized by an abundance of feldspar ) and some conglomerate . Average composition is 50 % feldspar , 25 -- 35 % quartz and up to 25 % rock fragments ; most feldspar is K - feldspar with only minor plagioclase as subrounded grains and highly altered inclusions within K - feldspar . The grains are typically 2 -- 4 millimetres ( 0.079 -- 0.157 in ) in diameter , and are angular to subangular ; the finer sandstone is well sorted , with sorting decreasing with increasing grain size . The rock fragments include subrounded basalt , invariably replaced to various degrees by chlorite and epidote . The minerals present suggest derivation from a predominantly granite source , similar to the Musgrave Block exposed to the south . When relatively fresh , the rock has a grey colour , but weathering of iron - bearing minerals by the process of oxidation gives the outer surface layer of rock a red - brown rusty colour . Features related to deposition of the sediment include cross-bedding and ripples , analysis of which indicated deposition from broad shallow high energy fluvial channels and sheet flooding , typical of alluvial fans . </P> <H3> Age and origin </H3> Rain water flows off Uluru along channels marked by dark algae , forming small ponds at the base <P> The Mutitjulu Arkose is believed to be of about the same age as the conglomerate at Kata Tjuta , and to have a similar origin despite the rock type being different , but it is younger than the rocks exposed to the east at Mount Conner , and unrelated to them . The strata at Uluru are nearly vertical , dipping to the south west at 85 \u00b0 , and have an exposed thickness of at least 2,400 m ( 7,900 ft ) . The strata dip below the surrounding plain and no doubt extend well beyond Uluru in the subsurface , but the extent is not known . </P> <P> The rock was originally sand , deposited as part of an extensive alluvial fan that extended out from the ancestors of the Musgrave , Mann and Petermann Ranges to the south and west , but separate from a nearby fan that deposited the sand , pebbles and cobbles that now make up Kata Tjuta . </P> <P> The similar mineral composition of the Mutitjulu Arkose and the granite ranges to the south is now explained . The ancestors of the ranges to the south were once much larger than the eroded remnants we see today . They were thrust up during a mountain building episode referred to as the Petermann Orogeny that took place in late Neoproterozoic to early Cambrian times ( 550 -- 530 Ma ) , and thus the Mutitjulu Arkose is believed to have been deposited at about the same time . </P> <P> The arkose sandstone which makes up the formation is composed of grains that show little sorting based on grain size , exhibit very little rounding and the feldspars in the rock are relatively fresh in appearance . This lack of sorting and grain rounding is typical of arkosic sandstones and is indicative of relatively rapid erosion from the granites of the growing mountains to the south . The layers of sand were nearly horizontal when deposited , but were tilted to their near vertical position during a later episode of mountain building , possibly the Alice Springs Orogeny of Palaeozoic age ( 400 -- 300 Ma ) . </P> <H2> Fauna and flora </H2> Black - flanked rock - wallaby ( Petrogale lateralis ) <P> Historically , 46 species of native mammals are known to have been living near Uluru ; according to recent surveys there are currently 21 . A\u1e49angu acknowledge that a decrease in the number has implications for the condition and health of the landscape . Moves are supported for the reintroduction of locally extinct animals such as malleefowl , common brushtail possum , rufous hare - wallaby or mala , bilby , burrowing bettong , and the black - flanked rock - wallaby . </P> <P> The mulgara , the only mammal listed as vulnerable , is mostly restricted to the transitional sand plain area , a narrow band of country that stretches from the vicinity of Uluru to the northern boundary of the park and into Ayers Rock Resort . This area also contains the marsupial mole , woma python , and great desert skink . </P> Trees at the base of Uluru <P> The bat population of the park comprises at least seven species that depend on day roosting sites within caves and crevices of Uluru and Kata Tjuta . Most of the bats forage for aerial prey within 100 m ( 330 ft ) or so from the rock face . The park has a very rich reptile fauna of high conservation significance , with 73 species having been reliably recorded . Four species of frogs are abundant at the base of Uluru and Kata Tjuta following summer rains . The great desert skink is listed as vulnerable . </P> <P> A\u1e49angu continue to hunt and gather animal species in remote areas of the park and on A\u1e49angu land elsewhere . Hunting is largely confined to the red kangaroo , bush turkey , emu , and lizards such as the sand goanna and perentie . </P> <P> Of the 27 mammal species found in the park , six are introduced : the house mouse , camel , fox , cat , dog , and rabbit . These species are distributed throughout the park , but their densities are greatest near the rich water run - off areas of Uluru and Kata Tjuta . </P> <P> Ulu\u1e5fu -- Kata Tju\u1e6fa National Park flora represents a large portion of plants found in Central Australia . A number of these species are considered rare and restricted in the park or the immediate region . Many rare and endemic plants are found in the park . </P> <P> The growth and reproduction of plant communities rely on irregular rainfall . Some plants are able to survive fire and some are dependent on it to reproduce . Plants are an important part of Tjukurpa , and ceremonies are held for each of the major plant foods . Many plants are associated with ancestral beings . </P> <P> Flora in Ulu\u1e5fu -- Kata Tju\u1e6fa National Park can be broken into these categories : </P> <Ul> <Li> Punu -- trees </Li> <Li> Puti -- shrubs </Li> <Li> Tjulpun - tjulpunpa -- flowers </Li> <Li> Ukiri -- grasses </Li> </Ul> <P> Trees such as the mulga and centralian bloodwood are used to make tools such as spearheads , boomerangs , and bowls . The red sap of the bloodwood is used as a disinfectant and an inhalant for coughs and colds . </P> <P> Several rare and endangered species are found in the park . Most of them , like adder 's tongue ferns , are restricted to the moist areas at the base of the formation , which are areas of high visitor use and subject to erosion . </P> <P> Since the first Europeans arrived , 34 exotic plant species have been recorded in the park , representing about 6.4 % of the total park flora . Some , such as perennial buffel grass ( Cenchrus ciliaris ) , were introduced to rehabilitate areas damaged by erosion . It is the most threatening weed in the park and has spread to invade water - and nutrient - rich drainage lines . A few others , such as burrgrass , were brought in accidentally , carried on cars and people . </P> <H2> Climate and five seasons </H2> <P> The park has a hot desert climate and receives an average rainfall of 284.6 mm ( 11.2 in ) per year . The average high temperature in summer ( December -- January ) is 37.8 \u00b0 C ( 100.0 \u00b0 F ) , and the average low temperature in winter ( June -- July ) is 4.7 \u00b0 C ( 40.5 \u00b0 F ) . Temperature extremes in the park have been recorded at 46 \u00b0 C ( 115 \u00b0 F ) during the summer and \u2212 5 \u00b0 C ( 23 \u00b0 F ) during winter . UV levels are extreme between October and March , averaging between 11 and 15 on the UV index . </P> <P> Local Aboriginal people recognise five seasons : </P> <Ol> <Li> Wanitjunkupai ( April / May ) -- Cooler weather </Li> <Li> Wari ( June / July ) -- Cold season bringing morning frosts </Li> <Li> Piriyakutu ( August / September / October ) -- Animals breed and food plants flower </Li> <Li> Mai Wiyaringkupai ( November / December ) -- The hot season when food becomes scarce </Li> <Li> Itjanu ( January / February / March ) -- Sporadic storms can roll in suddenly </Li> </Ol> <Table> <Tr> <Th_colspan=\"14\"> ( hide ) Climate data for Yulara Aero </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Month </Th> <Th> Jan </Th> <Th> Feb </Th> <Th> Mar </Th> <Th> Apr </Th> <Th> May </Th> <Th> Jun </Th> <Th> Jul </Th> <Th> Aug </Th> <Th> Sep </Th> <Th> Oct </Th> <Th> Nov </Th> <Th> Dec </Th> <Th> Year </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Record high \u00b0 C ( \u00b0 F ) </Th> <Td> 46.4 ( 115.5 ) </Td> <Td> 45.8 ( 114.4 ) </Td> <Td> 42.9 ( 109.2 ) </Td> <Td> 39.6 ( 103.3 ) </Td> <Td> 35.7 ( 96.3 ) </Td> <Td> 36.4 ( 97.5 ) </Td> <Td> 31.1 ( 88 ) </Td> <Td> 35.0 ( 95 ) </Td> <Td> 38.7 ( 101.7 ) </Td> <Td> 42.3 ( 108.1 ) </Td> <Td> 45.0 ( 113 ) </Td> <Td> 47.0 ( 116.6 ) </Td> <Td> 47.0 ( 116.6 ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Average high \u00b0 C ( \u00b0 F ) </Th> <Td> 38.4 ( 101.1 ) </Td> <Td> 36.9 ( 98.4 ) </Td> <Td> 34.4 ( 93.9 ) </Td> <Td> 29.8 ( 85.6 ) </Td> <Td> 24.2 ( 75.6 ) </Td> <Td> 20.4 ( 68.7 ) </Td> <Td> 20.4 ( 68.7 ) </Td> <Td> 23.7 ( 74.7 ) </Td> <Td> 28.8 ( 83.8 ) </Td> <Td> 32.4 ( 90.3 ) </Td> <Td> 35.1 ( 95.2 ) </Td> <Td> 36.5 ( 97.7 ) </Td> <Td> 30.1 ( 86.2 ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Average low \u00b0 C ( \u00b0 F ) </Th> <Td> 22.7 ( 72.9 ) </Td> <Td> 22.1 ( 71.8 ) </Td> <Td> 19.3 ( 66.7 ) </Td> <Td> 14.4 ( 57.9 ) </Td> <Td> 9.3 ( 48.7 ) </Td> <Td> 5.6 ( 42.1 ) </Td> <Td> 4.4 ( 39.9 ) </Td> <Td> 5.9 ( 42.6 ) </Td> <Td> 10.7 ( 51.3 ) </Td> <Td> 15.0 ( 59 ) </Td> <Td> 18.4 ( 65.1 ) </Td> <Td> 20.8 ( 69.4 ) </Td> <Td> 14.1 ( 57.4 ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Record low \u00b0 C ( \u00b0 F ) </Th> <Td> 12.7 ( 54.9 ) </Td> <Td> 12.1 ( 53.8 ) </Td> <Td> 8.0 ( 46.4 ) </Td> <Td> 1.3 ( 34.3 ) </Td> <Td> ( 34 ) </Td> <Td> \u2212 1.8 ( 28.8 ) </Td> <Td> \u2212 3.6 ( 25.5 ) </Td> <Td> \u2212 2.2 ( 28 ) </Td> <Td> \u2212 1.0 ( 30.2 ) </Td> <Td> 4.5 ( 40.1 ) </Td> <Td> 6.5 ( 43.7 ) </Td> <Td> 9.9 ( 49.8 ) </Td> <Td> \u2212 3.6 ( 25.5 ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Average rainfall mm ( inches ) </Th> <Td> 25.8 ( 1.016 ) </Td> <Td> 39.6 ( 1.559 ) </Td> <Td> 35.1 ( 1.382 ) </Td> <Td> 14.7 ( 0.579 ) </Td> <Td> 13.0 ( 0.512 ) </Td> <Td> 17.4 ( 0.685 ) </Td> <Td> 18.4 ( 0.724 ) </Td> <Td> 4.3 ( 0.169 ) </Td> <Td> 7.4 ( 0.291 ) </Td> <Td> 20.7 ( 0.815 ) </Td> <Td> 34.2 ( 1.346 ) </Td> <Td> 40.2 ( 1.583 ) </Td> <Td> 274.6 ( 10.811 ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Average rainy days ( \u2265 1 mm ) </Th> <Td> 3.2 </Td> <Td> 2.9 </Td> <Td> 2.0 </Td> <Td> 1.7 </Td> <Td> 1.8 </Td> <Td> 1.6 </Td> <Td> 1.9 </Td> <Td> 1.0 </Td> <Td> 1.4 </Td> <Td> 2.7 </Td> <Td> 3.9 </Td> <Td> 4.7 </Td> <Td> 28.8 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan=\"14\"> Source : Bureau of Meteorology </Td> </Tr> </Table> <H2> Aboriginal myths , legends and traditions </H2> <P> According to the A\u1e49angu , traditional landowners of Uluru : </P> <P> The world was once a featureless place . None of the places we know existed until creator beings , in the forms of people , plants and animals , traveled widely across the land . Then , in a process of creation and destruction , they formed the landscape as we know it today . A\u1e49angu land is still inhabited by the spirits of dozens of these ancestral creator beings which are referred to as Tjukuritja or Waparitja . </P> <P> There are a number of differing accounts given , by outsiders , of Aboriginal ancestral stories for the origins of Uluru and its many cracks and fissures . One such account , taken from Robert Layton 's ( 1989 ) Uluru : An Aboriginal history of Ayers Rock , reads as follows : </P> <P> Uluru was built up during the creation period by two boys who played in the mud after rain . When they had finished their game they travelled south to Wiputa ... Fighting together , the two boys made their way to the table topped Mount Conner , on top of which their bodies are preserved as boulders . ( Page 5 ) </P> <P> Two other accounts are given in Norbert Brockman 's ( 1997 ) Encyclopedia of Sacred Places . The first tells of serpent beings who waged many wars around Uluru , scarring the rock . The second tells of two tribes of ancestral spirits who were invited to a feast , but were distracted by the beautiful Sleepy Lizard Women and did not show up . In response , the angry hosts sang evil into a mud sculpture that came to life as the dingo . There followed a great battle , which ended in the deaths of the leaders of both tribes . The earth itself rose up in grief at the bloodshed , becoming Uluru . </P> <P> The Commonwealth Department of Environment 's webpage advises : </P> <P> Many ... Tjukurpa such as Kalaya ( Emu ) , Liru ( poisonous snake ) , Lungkata ( blue tongue lizard ) , Luunpa ( kingfisher ) and Tjintir - tjintirpa ( willie wagtail ) travel through Ulu\u1e5fu - Kata Tju\u1e6fa National Park . Other Tjukurpa affect only one specific area . </P> <P> Kuniya , the woma python , lived in the rocks at Uluru where she fought the Liru , the poisonous snake . </P> <P> It is sometimes reported that those who take rocks from the formation will be cursed and suffer misfortune . There have been many instances where people who removed such rocks attempted to mail them back to various agencies in an attempt to remove the perceived curse . </P> <H2> History </H2> Petroglyphs on Uluru Aerial view of Uluru <P> Archaeological findings to the east and west indicate that humans settled in the area more than 10,000 years ago . Europeans arrived in the Australian Western Desert in the 1870s . Uluru and Kata Tjuta were first mapped by Europeans in 1872 during the expeditionary period made possible by the construction of the Australian Overland Telegraph Line . In separate expeditions , Ernest Giles and William Gosse were the first European explorers to this area . </P> <P> While exploring the area in 1872 , Giles sighted Kata Tjuta from a location near Kings Canyon and called it Mount Olga , while the following year Gosse observed Uluru and named it Ayers Rock , in honour of the Chief Secretary of South Australia , Sir Henry Ayers . Further explorations followed with the aim of establishing the possibilities of the area for pastoralism . In the late 19th century , pastoralists attempted to establish themselves in areas adjoining the Southwestern / Petermann Reserve and interaction between A\u1e49angu and white people became more frequent and more violent . Due to the effects of grazing and drought , bush food stores became depleted . Competition for these resources created conflict between the two groups , resulting in more frequent police patrols . Later , during the depression in the 1930s , A\u1e49angu became involved in dingo scalping with ' doggers ' who introduced A\u1e49angu to European foods and ways . </P> <P> Between 1918 and 1921 , large adjoining areas of South Australia , Western Australia , and the Northern Territory were declared as Aboriginal reserves , sanctuaries for nomadic people who had virtually no contact with European settlers . In 1920 , part of Ulu\u1e5fu -- Kata Tju\u1e6fa National Park was declared an Aboriginal Reserve ( commonly known as the South - Western or Petermann Reserve ) by the Australian government under the Aboriginals Ordinance . </P> <P> The first tourists arrived in the Uluru area in 1936 . Beginning in the 1940s , permanent European settlement of the area for reasons of the Aboriginal welfare policy and to help promote tourism of Uluru . This increased tourism prompted the formation of the first vehicular tracks in 1948 and tour bus services began early in the 1950s . In 1958 , the area that would become the Ulu\u1e5fu -- Kata Tju\u1e6fa National Park was excised from the Petermann Reserve ; it was placed under the management of the Northern Territory Reserves Board and named the Ayers Rock -- Mount Olga National Park . The first ranger was Bill Harney , a well - recognised central Australian figure . By 1959 , the first motel leases had been granted and Eddie Connellan had constructed an airstrip close to the northern side of Uluru . </P> <P> On 26 October 1985 , the Australian government returned ownership of Uluru to the local Pitjantjatjara Aborigines , with one of the conditions being that the A\u1e49angu would lease it back to the National Parks and Wildlife agency for 99 years and that it would be jointly managed . An agreement originally made between the community and Prime Minister Bob Hawke that the climb to the top by tourists would be stopped was later broken . The Aboriginal community of Mutitjulu , with a population of approximately 300 , is located near the eastern end of Uluru . From Uluru it is 17 km ( 11 mi ) by road to the tourist town of Yulara , population 3,000 , which is situated just outside the national park . </P> <P> On 8 October 2009 , the Talinguru Nyakuntjaku viewing area opened to public visitation . The A $ 21 million project about 3 kilometres ( 1.9 mi ) on the east side of Uluru involved design and construction supervision by the A\u1e49angu traditional owners , with 11 kilometres ( 6.8 mi ) of roads and 1.6 kilometres ( 1 mi ) of walking trails being built for the area . </P> <H2> Tourism </H2> Driving on Lasseter Highway from Ulu\u1e5fu -- Kata Tju\u1e6fa National Park , April 2007 <P> The development of tourism infrastructure adjacent to the base of Uluru that began in the 1950s soon produced adverse environmental impacts . It was decided in the early 1970s to remove all accommodation - related tourist facilities and re-establish them outside the park . In 1975 , a reservation of 104 square kilometres ( 40 sq mi ) of land beyond the park 's northern boundary , 15 kilometres ( 9 mi ) from Uluru , was approved for the development of a tourist facility and an associated airport , to be known as Yulara . The camp ground within the park was closed in 1983 and the motels closed in late 1984 , coinciding with the opening of the Yulara resort . In 1992 , the majority interest in the Yulara resort held by the Northern Territory Government was sold and the resort was renamed Ayers Rock Resort . </P> <P> Since the park was listed as a World Heritage Site , annual visitor numbers rose to over 400,000 visitors by the year 2000 . Increased tourism provides regional and national economic benefits . It also presents an ongoing challenge to balance conservation of cultural values and visitor needs . </P> <H3> Admission </H3> <P> Admission to the park costs A $25 per person and provides a three - day pass . Passes are non-transferable and all passes are checked by park rangers . </P> <H3> Climbing </H3> Climbers and a warning sign <P> The local A\u1e49angu do not climb Uluru because of its great spiritual significance . They request that visitors do not climb the rock , partly due to the path crossing a sacred traditional Dreamtime track , and also due to a sense of responsibility for the safety of visitors . The visitors guide says `` the climb is not prohibited , but we prefer that , as a guest on A\u1e49angu land , you will choose to respect our law and culture by not climbing . '' </P> <P> Despite being discouraged by its traditional owners , over one third of visitors climb Uluru . A chain handhold added in 1964 and extended in 1976 makes the hour - long climb easier , but it is still a steep , 800 m ( 0.5 mi ) hike to the top , where it can be quite windy . It is recommended individuals drink plenty of water while climbing , and those who are unfit , suffer from vertigo or medical conditions restricting exercise , do not attempt it . Climbing Uluru is generally closed to the public when high winds are present at the top . There have been at least 35 deaths relating to recreational climbing since such incidents began being recorded . </P> <P> On 11 December 1983 , the Prime Minister of Australia , Bob Hawke , promised to hand back the land title to the A\u1e49angu traditional custodians and caretakers and agreed to the community 's 10 - point plan which included forbidding the climbing of Uluru . The government , however , set access to climb Uluru and a 99 - year lease , instead of the previously agreed upon 50 - year lease , as conditions before the title was officially given back to the A\u1e49angu on 26 October 1985 . </P> <P> The Aboriginal traditional owners of Ulu\u1e5fu -- Kata Tju\u1e6fa National Park ( Nguraritja ) and the Federal Government 's National Parks share decision - making on the management of Ulu\u1e5fu -- Kata Tju\u1e6fa National Park . Under their joint Ulu\u1e5fu -- Kata Tju\u1e6fa National Park Management Plan 2010 -- 20 , issued by the Director of National Parks under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 , clause 6.3. 3 provides that the Director and the Ulu\u1e5fu -- Kata Tju\u1e6fa Board of Management work towards closure of the climb and , additionally , provides that it will close upon any of three conditions being met : there are `` adequate new visitor experiences '' , less than 20 per cent of visitors make the climb or the `` critical factors '' in decisions to visit are `` cultural and natural experiences '' . Despite cogent evidence the second condition was met by July 2013 , the climb remains open . </P> <P> Several controversial incidents on top of Uluru in 2010 , including a striptease , golfing and nudity , led to renewed calls for banning the climb . </P> <Ul> <Li> <P> Prince Charles and Diana , The Princess of Wales returning from photo session on Uluru , March 1983 </P> </Li> <Li> <P> Sign informing tourists that the climb is closed due to strong winds </P> </Li> </Ul> <H3> Photography </H3> <P> The A\u1e49angu also request that visitors do not photograph certain sections of Uluru , for reasons related to traditional Tjukurpa beliefs . These areas are the sites of gender - linked rituals and are forbidden ground for A\u1e49angu of the opposite sex to those participating in the rituals in question . The photographic restriction is intended to prevent A\u1e49angu from inadvertently violating this taboo by encountering photographs of the forbidden sites in the outside world . </P> <H2> See also </H2> <Ul> <Li> Northern Territory portal </Li> <Li> Mountains portal </Li> </Ul> <Ul> <Li> List of mountains of the Northern Territory </Li> <Li> Mount Augustus National Park </Li> <Li> Indigenous Australian art </Li> <Li> Pitjantjatjara \u00a7 Recognition of sacred sites </Li> <Li> Protected areas of the Northern Territory </Li> </Ul> <H2> References </H2> <Dl> <Dt> Notes </Dt> </Dl> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ `` Place Names Register Extract : Uluru / Ayers Rock '' .
