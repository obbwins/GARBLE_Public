He played Lonnie , a banjo - playing teenager of the country in north Georgia , who played the noted `` Dueling Banjos '' with Drew Ballinger ( Ronny Cox ) . The film was critically acclaimed and received nominations for awards in several categories . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Early life </Li> <Li> 2 Career </Li> <Li> 3 Filmography </Li> <Li> 4 References </Li> <Li> 5 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Early life ( edit ) </H2> <P> Redden was born in Rabun County , Georgia . </P> <H2> Career ( edit ) </H2> <P> At the age of 16 , he was selected for a role in Deliverance from his school in Georgia by the director John Boorman to portray a banjo - playing `` local '' during the film 's famous `` dueling banjos '' scene . Boorman felt that Redden 's skinny frame and large head , and almond shaped eyes made him the natural choice to play the part of an `` inbred from the back woods . '' Because Redden could not play a banjo , he wore a special shirt which allowed a real banjo player to hide behind him for the scene , which was shot with carefully chosen camera angles that would conceal the player , whose arms were slipped around Redden 's waist to play the tune . </P> <P> After Deliverance , Redden was cast in Lamberto Bava 's 1984 film Blastfighter . The film was recorded in and around Clayton and many people recall it as a mixture of Deliverance and First Blood . </P> <P> Redden next appeared in Tim Burton 's 2003 film Big Fish . Burton was intent on getting Redden , as he wanted him to play ( really ? ) the role of a banjo - playing `` welcomer '' in the utopian town of Spectre . Burton located Redden in Clayton , Georgia , where he was part - owner of the Cookie Jar Caf\u00e9 , and also worked as a cook and dishwasher . </P> <P> In 2004 , Redden made a guest appearance on Blue Collar TV , playing a car repairman named Ray in a `` Redneck Dictionary '' skit . He represented the word `` raisin bread '' ( as in `` Ray 's inbred '' ) . He played a banjo in the skit . </P> <P> In 2009 , Redden played again his usual role ( The banjo man ) in Ace Cruz 's film Outrage : Born in Terror . </P> <P> In 2012 , 40 years after the release of Deliverance , Redden was interviewed in association with a documentary , The Deliverance of Rabun County ( 2012 ) . It explored the feelings of people in Rabun County four decades later about the 1972 film . Redden said that though Deliverance was the best thing that happened to him , he never saw much money from the movie : </P> <P> I 'd like to have all the money I thought I 'd make from this movie . I would n't be working at Walmart right now . And I 'm struggling really hard to make ends meet . </P> <P> Noting some locals objected to the stereotypes in the movie , Redden said that the people in Rabun County were good people : </P> <P> We 're not a bad people up here , we 're a loving people . Rabun County is a pretty good town . It 's peaceful , not a lot of crime going on , just a real peaceful town . Everybody pretty much gets along with everybody . </P> <H2> Filmography ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Deliverance ( 1972 ) - Lonnie </Li> <Li> Blastfighter ( 1984 ) - Banjo Man ( uncredited ) </Li> <Li> Big Fish ( 2003 ) - Banjo Man </Li> <Li> Outrage ( 2009 ) - Banjo Man ( final film role ) </Li> </Ul> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ Potempa , Philip ( October 19 , 2008 ) . `` Burt Reynolds and ' Deliverance ' boy reunited `` .
