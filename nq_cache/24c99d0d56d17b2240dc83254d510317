At the time of the 1917 Revolution , the Russian Orthodox Church was deeply integrated into the autocratic state , enjoying official status . This was a significant factor that contributed to the Bolshevik attitude to religion and the steps they took to control it . Thus the USSR became the first state to have as one objective of its official ideology the elimination of existing religion , and the prevention of future implanting of religious belief , with the goal of establishing state atheism ( gosateizm ) . Under the doctrine of state atheism in the Soviet Union , there was a `` government - sponsored program of conversion to atheism '' conducted by Communists . The communist regime targeted religions based on State interests , and while most organized religions were never outlawed , religious property was confiscated , believers were harassed , and religion was ridiculed while atheism was propagated in schools . In 1925 the government founded the League of Militant Atheists to intensify the persecution . Accordingly , although personal expressions of religious faith were not explicitly banned , a strong sense of social stigma was imposed on them by the official structures and mass media and it was generally considered unacceptable for members of certain professions ( teachers , state bureaucrats , soldiers ) to be openly religious . </P> <P> The vast majority of people in the Russian empire were , at the time of the revolution , religious believers , whereas the communists aimed to break the power of all religious institutions and eventually replace religious belief with atheism . `` Science '' was counterposed to `` religious superstition '' in the media and in academic writing . The main religions of pre-revolutionary Russia persisted throughout the entire Soviet period , but they were only tolerated within certain limits . Generally , this meant that believers were free to worship in private and in their respective religious buildings ( churches , mosques , etc . ) , but public displays of religion outside of such designated areas were prohibited . In addition , religious institutions were not allowed to express their views in any type of mass media , and many religious buildings were demolished or used for other purposes . </P> <P> As the founder of the Soviet state , V.I. Lenin , put it : </P> <P> Religion is the opium of the people : this saying of Marx is the cornerstone of the entire ideology of Marxism about religion . All modern religions and churches , all and of every kind of religious organizations are always considered by Marxism as the organs of bourgeois reaction , used for the protection of the exploitation and the stupefaction of the working class . </P> <P> Marxist -- Leninist atheism has consistently advocated the control , suppression , and elimination of religion . Within about a year of the revolution , the state expropriated all church property , including the churches themselves , and in the period from 1922 to 1926 , 28 Russian Orthodox bishops and more than 1,200 priests were killed . Many more were persecuted . </P> <P> Christians belonged to various churches : Orthodox ( which had the largest number of followers ) , Catholic , Baptist and various other Protestant denominations . The majority of the Muslims in the Soviet Union were Sunni . Judaism also had many followers . Other religions , practiced by a small number of believers , included Buddhism and Shamanism . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Orthodox <Ul> <Li> 1.1 Russian Orthodox Church </Li> <Li> 1.2 Georgian Orthodox Church </Li> <Li> 1.3 Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church </Li> <Li> 1.4 Armenian Apostolic </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 Catholics <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Roman Catholic Church </Li> <Li> 2.2 Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Protestants <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Persecution and other themes </Li> <Li> 3.2 Baptists </Li> <Li> 3.3 Lutherans </Li> <Li> 3.4 Other Protestants </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Other Christian groups </Li> <Li> 5 Islam </Li> <Li> 6 Policy toward religions in practice <Ul> <Li> 6.1 Policy towards nationalities and religion </Li> <Li> 6.2 Policy towards Orthodoxy </Li> <Li> 6.3 Policy towards Catholicism and Protestantism </Li> <Li> 6.4 Policy toward other Christian groups </Li> <Li> 6.5 Policy towards Islam </Li> <Li> 6.6 Policy towards Judaism </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 7 See also </Li> <Li> 8 References </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Orthodox ( edit ) </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> This section does not cite any sources .

The palace was never finished , and the cathedral was rebuilt in 2000 . <P> Orthodox Christians constituted a majority of believers in the Soviet Union . In the late 1980s , three Orthodox churches claimed substantial memberships there : the Russian Orthodox Church , the Georgian Orthodox Church , and the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church ( AOC ) . They were members of the major confederation of Orthodox churches in the world , generally referred to as the Eastern Orthodox Church . The first two functioned openly and were tolerated by the regime , but the Ukrainian AOC was not permitted to function openly . Parishes of the Belarusian Autocephalous Orthodox Church reappeared in Belarus only after the dissolution of the Soviet Union , but they did not receive recognition from the Belarusian Exarchate of the Russian Orthodox Church , which controls Belarusian eparchies . </P> <H3> Russian Orthodox Church ( edit ) </H3> <P> According to both Soviet and Western sources , in the late 1980s the Russian Orthodox Church had over 50 million believers but only about 7,000 registered active churches . Over 4,000 of these churches were located in the Ukrainian Republic ( almost half of them in western Ukraine ) . The distribution of the six monasteries and ten convents of the Russian Orthodox Church was equally disproportionate . Only two of the monasteries were located in the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic . Another two were in Ukraine and there was one each in Belarus and Lithuania . Seven convents were located in Ukraine and one each in Moldova , Estonia , and Latvia . </P> <H3> Georgian Orthodox Church ( edit ) </H3> <P> The Georgian Orthodox Church , another autocephalous member of Eastern Orthodoxy , was headed by a Georgian patriarch . In the late 1980s it had 15 bishops , 180 priests , 200 parishes , and an estimated 2.5 million followers . In 1811 the Georgian Orthodox Church was incorporated into the Russian Orthodox Church , but it regained its independence in 1917 , after the fall of the Tsar . Nevertheless , the Russian Orthodox Church did not officially recognize its independence until 1943 . </P> <H3> Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church ( edit ) </H3> <P> The Ukrainian AOC separated from the Russian Orthodox Church in 1919 , when the short - lived Ukrainian state adopted a decree declaring autocephaly from the Ukrainian Orthodox Church . Its independence was reaffirmed by the Bolsheviks in the Ukrainian Republic , and by 1924 it had 30 bishops , almost 1,500 priests , nearly 1,100 parishes , and between 4 and 6 million members . </P> <P> From its inception , the Ukrainian AOC faced the hostility of the Russian Orthodox Church in the Ukrainian Republic . In the late 1920s , Soviet authorities accused it of nationalist tendencies . In 1930 the government forced the church to reorganize as the `` Ukrainian Orthodox Church '' , and few of its parishes survived until 1936 . Nevertheless , the Ukrainian AOC continued to function outside the borders of the Soviet Union , and it was revived on Ukrainian territory under the German occupation during World War II . In the late 1980s , some of the Orthodox faithful in the Ukrainian Republic appealed to the Soviet government to reestablish the Ukrainian AOC . </P> <H3> Armenian Apostolic ( edit ) </H3> <P> The Armenian Apostolic Church is an independent Oriental Orthodox church . In the 1980s it had about 4 million adherents -- almost the entire population of Armenia . It was permitted 6 bishops , between 50 and 100 priests , and between 20 and 30 churches , and it had one theological seminary and six monasteries . </P> <H2> Catholics ( edit ) </H2> <P> Catholics formed a substantial and active religious constituency in the Soviet Union . Their number increased dramatically with the annexation of territories of the Second Polish Republic in 1939 and the Baltic republics in 1940 . Catholics in the Soviet Union were divided between those belonging to the Roman Catholic Church , which was recognized by the government , and those remaining loyal to the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church , banned since 1946 . </P> <H3> Roman Catholic Church ( edit ) </H3> <P> The majority of the 5.5 million Roman Catholics in the Soviet Union lived in the Lithuanian , Belarusian , and Latvian republics , with a sprinkling in the Moldavian , Ukrainian , and Russian republics . Since World War II , the most active Roman Catholic Church in the Soviet Union was in the Lithuanian Republic , where the majority of people are Catholics . The Roman Catholic Church there has been viewed as an institution that both fosters and defends Lithuanian national interests and values . Since 1972 a Catholic underground publication , The Chronicle of the Catholic Church in Lithuania , supported not only Lithuanians ' religious rights but also their national rights . </P> <H3> Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church ( edit ) </H3> See also : History of Christianity in Ukraine <P> Western Ukraine , which included largely the historic region of Galicia , became part of the Soviet Union in 1939 . Although Ukrainian , its population was never part of the Russian Empire , but was Eastern Rite Catholic . After the Second World War , the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church identified closely with the nationalist aspirations of the region , arousing the hostility of the Soviet government , which was in combat with Ukrainian Insurgency . In 1945 , Soviet authorities arrested the church 's Metropolitan Josyf Slipyj , nine bishops and hundreds of clergy and leading lay activists , and deported them to forced labor camps in Siberia and elsewhere . The nine bishops and many of the clergy died in prisons , concentration camps , internal exile , or soon after their release during the post-Stalin thaw , but after 18 years of imprisonment and persecution , Metropolitan Slipyj was released when Pope John XXIII intervened on his behalf . Slipyj went to Rome , where he received the title of Major Archbishop of Lviv , and became a cardinal in 1965 . </P> <P> In 1946 a synod was called in Lviv , where , despite being uncanonical in both Catholic and Orthodox understanding , the Union of Brest was annulled , and the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church was officially annexed to the Russian Orthodox Church . St. George 's Cathedral in Lviv became the throne of Russian Orthodox Archbishop Makariy . </P> <P> For the clergy that joined the Russian Orthodox Church , the Soviet authorities refrained from the large - scale persecution seen elsewhere . In Lviv only one church was closed . In fact , the western dioceses of Lviv - Ternopil and Ivano - Frankivsk were the largest in the USSR . Canon law was also relaxed , allowing the clergy to shave their beards ( a practice uncommon in Orthodoxy ) and to conduct services in Ukrainian instead of Slavonic . </P> <P> In 1989 the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church was officially re-established after a catacomb period of more than 40 years . There followed conflicts between Orthodox and Catholic Christians regarding the ownership of church buildings , conflicts which continued into the 1990s , after the Independence of Ukraine . </P> <H2> Protestants ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Persecution and other themes ( edit ) </H3> See also : Anti-Protestantism <P> Many Protestants were apprehended under Communist rule of law , including imprisonment and execution . Vladimir Shelkov ( 1895 -- 1980 ) , the leader of the unregistered Seventh - day Adventist movement in the Soviet Union , spent almost all his life from 1931 on in prison ; he died in Yakutia camp . Large numbers of Pentecostals were imprisoned , and many died there , including Ivan Voronaev , one of their leaders . In the period after the Second World War , Protestants in the USSR ( indigenous sectarian Spiritual Christians , Baptists , Pentecostals , Adventists and others ) were sent to mental hospitals or tried and imprisoned , often for refusal to enter military service . Some were deprived of their parental rights . The Lutheran Church in different regions of the country was persecuted during the Soviet era , and church property was confiscated . Many of its members and pastors were oppressed , and some were forced to emigrate . </P> <H3> Baptists ( edit ) </H3> <P> By 1950 , it was estimated that there were 2 million Baptists in the Soviet Union , with the largest number in Ukraine . Baptists were the largest Protestant grouping in the country . In 1991 , Ukraine had the second largest Baptist community in the world , behind only the United States . Baptists constituted the largest Protestant group . Spread throughout the Soviet Union , some congregations were registered with the government and functioned with official approval . Many other unregistered congregations carried on religious activity without such approval . </P> <H3> Lutherans ( edit ) </H3> <P> Lutherans , the second largest Protestant group , lived for the most part in the Latvian and Estonian republics . In the 1980s , Lutheran churches in these republics identified to some extent with nationality issues in the two republics . The regime 's attitude toward Lutherans was generally benign . </P> <H3> Other Protestants ( edit ) </H3> <P> A number of other Protestant groups were present , including Adventists , Pentecostals , and Reformed . </P> <H2> Other Christian groups ( edit ) </H2> <P> The March 1961 instruction on religious cults explained for the first time , that `` sects , the teaching and character of activities of which has anti-state and savagely extremist ( \u0438\u0437\u0443\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 ) character : Jehovah 's Witnesses , Pentecostalists , Adventists - reformists '' are not to be registered and were thus banned . </P> <P> A number of congregations of Russian Mennonites , Jehovah 's Witnesses , and other Christian groups existed in the Soviet Union . Nearly 9,000 Jehovah 's Witnesses were deported to Siberia in 1951 ( numbers of those missed in deportation unknown ) . The number of Jehovah 's Witnesses increased greatly over this period , with a KGB estimate of around 20,000 in 1968 . Russian Mennonites began to emigrate from the Soviet Union in the face of increasing violence and persecution , state restrictions on freedom of religion , and biased allotments of communal farmland . They emigrated to Germany , Britain , the United States , parts of South America , and other regions . </P> <H2> Islam ( edit ) </H2> Main article : Islam in the Soviet Union Map showing the distribution of Muslims within the Soviet Union in 1979 as a percentage of the population by administrative division . <P> After the Bolshevik revolution , Islam was for some time ( until 1929 ) treated better than the Russian Orthodox Church , which Bolsheviks regarded as a center of the `` reaction '' , and other religions . In the declaration `` \u041a\u043e \u0432\u0441\u0435\u043c \u0442\u0440\u0443\u0434\u044f\u0449\u0438\u043c\u0441\u044f \u043c\u0443\u0441\u0443\u043b\u044c\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0430\u043c \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438 \u0438 \u0412\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u043a\u0430 '' ( To All Working Muslims in Russia and the Orient ) of November 1917 , the Bolshevik government declared the freedom to exercise their religion and customs for Muslims `` whose beliefs and customs had been suppressed by the Czars and the Russian oppressors '' . </P> <P> In the second half of 1920s and in 1930s , state repressions , suppression and atheist propaganda against all religions increased . E.g. in 1930 , out of the 12,000 mosques in Tatarstan , more than 10,000 were closed , from 90 to 97 % mullahs and muezzins were deprived of the right to exercise their profession . </P> <P> During the German - Soviet War , the restrictions on religion were eased somewhat . In 1943 the Spiritual Administration of the Muslims of Central Asia and Kazakhstan was established . In 1949 , 415 registered mosques functioned in the Soviet Union . </P> <P> In the late 1980s , Islam had the second largest following in the Soviet Union : between 45 and 50 million people identified themselves as Muslims . But the Soviet Union had only about 500 working mosques , a fraction of the number in prerevolutionary Russia , and Soviet law forbade Islamic religious activity outside working mosques and Islamic schools . </P> <P> All working mosques , religious schools , and Islamic publications were supervised by four `` spiritual directorates '' established by Soviet authorities to provide government control . The Spiritual Directorate for Central Asia and Kazakhstan , the Spiritual Directorate for the European Soviet Union and Siberia , and the Spiritual Directorate for the Northern Caucasus and Dagestan oversaw the religious life of Sunni Muslims . The Spiritual Directorate for Transcaucasia dealt with both Sunni Muslims and Shia Muslims . The overwhelming majority of the Muslims were Sunnis . </P> <P> Soviet Muslims differed linguistically and culturally from each other , speaking about fifteen Turkic languages , ten Iranian languages , and thirty Caucasian languages . Hence , communication between different Muslim groups was difficult . In 1989 Russian often served as a lingua franca among some educated Muslims . </P> <P> Culturally , some Muslim groups had highly developed urban traditions , whereas others were recently nomadic . Some lived in industrialized environments , others in isolated mountainous regions . In sum , Muslims were not a homogeneous group with a common national identity and heritage , although they shared the same religion and the same country . </P> <P> In the late 1980s , unofficial Muslim congregations , meeting in tea houses and private homes with their own mullahs , greatly outnumbered those in the officially sanctioned mosques . The unofficial mullahs were either self - taught or informally trained by other mullahs . In the late 1980s , unofficial Islam appeared to split into fundamentalist congregations and groups that emphasized Sufism . </P> <H2> Policy toward religions in practice ( edit ) </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Mass repression in the Soviet Union </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Economic repression </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> <Ul> <Li> Collectivization </Li> <Li> Dekulakization </Li> <Li> Soviet famine of 1932 -- 33 </Li> </Ul> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Political repression </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> <Ul> <Li> Red Terror </Li> <Li> Great Purge </Li> <Li> Gulag </Li> <Li> Psychiatric </Li> </Ul> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Ideological repression </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> <Ul> <Li> Religion <Ul> <Li> 1917 - 1921 </Li> <Li> 1921 -- 28 </Li> <Li> 1928 -- 41 </Li> <Li> 1958 -- 64 </Li> <Li> 1975 -- 87 </Li> <Li> Christianity </Li> <Li> Islam </Li> <Li> Legislation </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> Science </Li> <Li> Censorship <Ul> <Li> Images </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Ethnic repression </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> <Ul> <Li> Antisemitism </Li> <Li> Holodomor </Li> <Li> NKVD Polish Operation </Li> <Li> Population transfers </Li> </Ul> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> <Ul> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> </Ul> </Td> </Tr> </Table> See also : Living Church and USSR anti-religious campaign ( 1928 -- 1941 ) <P> Soviet policy toward religion was based on the ideology of Marxism - Leninism , which made atheism the official doctrine of the Communist Party . However , `` the Soviet law and administrative practice through most of the 1920s extended some tolerance to religion and forbade the arbitrary closing or destruction of some functioning churches '' , and each successive Soviet constitution granted freedom of belief . As the founder of the Soviet state , Lenin , put it : </P> <P> Religion is the opium of the people : this saying of Marx is the cornerstone of the entire ideology of Marxism about religion . All modern religions and churches , all and of every kind of religious organizations are always considered by Marxism as the organs of bourgeois reaction , used for the protection of the exploitation and the stupefaction of the working class . </P> <P> Marxism - Leninism advocates the suppression and ultimately the disappearance of religious beliefs , considering them to be `` unscientific '' and `` superstitious '' . In the 1920s and 1930s , such organizations as the League of the Militant Godless were active in anti-religious propaganda . Atheism was the norm in schools , communist organizations ( such as the Young Pioneer Organization ) , and the media . </P> <P> The regime 's efforts to eradicate religion in the Soviet Union , however , varied over the years with respect to particular religions and were affected by higher state interests . In 1923 , a New York Times correspondent saw Christians observing Easter peacefully in Moscow despite violent anti-religious actions in previous years . Official policies and practices not only varied with time , but also differed in their application from one nationality to another and from one religion to another . </P> <P> In 1929 , with the onset of the Cultural Revolution in the Soviet Union and an upsurge of radical militancy in the Party and Komsomol , a powerful `` hard line '' in favor of mass closing of churches and arrests of priests became dominant and evidently won Stalin 's approval . Secret `` hard line '' instructions were issued to local party organizations , but not published . When the anti-religious drive inflamed the anger of the rural population , not to mention that of the Pope and other Western church spokesmen , the regime was able to back off from a policy that it had never publicly endorsed anyway . </P> <P> Although all Soviet leaders had the same long - range goal of developing a cohesive Soviet people , they pursued different policies to achieve it . For the Soviet regime , questions of nationality and religion were always closely linked . Therefore , their attitude toward religion also varied from a total ban on some religions to official support of others . </P> <H3> Policy towards nationalities and religion ( edit ) </H3> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> This section does not cite any sources .

( November 2011 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> In theory , the Soviet Constitution described the regime 's position regarding nationalities and religions . It stated that every Soviet citizen also had a particular nationality , and every Soviet passport carried these two entries . The constitution granted a large degree of local autonomy , but this autonomy was subordinated to central authority . In addition , because local and central administrative structures were often not clearly divided , local autonomy was further weakened . Although under the Constitution all nationalities were equal , in practice they were not treated so . Only fifteen nationalities had union republic status , which granted them , in principle , many rights , including the right to secede from the union . </P> <P> Twenty - two nationalities lived in autonomous republics with a degree of local self - government and representation in the Council of Nationalities in the Supreme Soviet . Eighteen more nationalities had territorial enclaves ( autonomous oblasts and autonomous okrugs ) but had very few powers of self - government . The remaining nationalities had no right of self - government at all . Joseph Stalin 's 1913 definition of a nation as `` a historically constituted and stable community of people formed on the basis of common language , territory , economic life , and psychological makeup revealed in a common culture '' was retained by Soviet authorities throughout the 1980s . However , in granting nationalities union republic status , three additional factors were considered : a population of at least 1 million , territorial compactness , and location on the borders of the Soviet Union . </P> <P> Although Lenin believed that eventually all nationalities would merge into one , he insisted that the Soviet Union be established as a federation of formally equal nations . In the 1920s , genuine cultural concessions were granted to the nationalities . Communist elites of various nationalities were permitted to flourish and to have considerable self - government . National cultures , religions , and languages were not merely tolerated but , in areas with Muslim populations , encouraged . </P> <P> Demographic changes in the 1960s and 1970s whittled down the overall Russian majority , but they also caused two nationalities ( the Kazakhs and Kirgiz ) to become minorities in their own republics at the time of the 1979 census , and considerably reduced the majority of the titular nationalities in other republics . This situation led Leonid Brezhnev to declare at the 24th Communist Party Congress in 1971 that the process of creating a unified Soviet people had been completed , and proposals were made to abolish the federative system and replace it with a single state . In the 1970s , however , a broad movement of national dissent began to spread throughout the Soviet Union . It manifestated itself in many ways : Jews insisted on their right to emigrate to Israel ; Crimean Tatars demanded to be allowed to return to Crimea ; Lithuanians called for the restoration of the rights of the Catholic Church ; and Helsinki Watch groups were established in the Georgian , Lithuanian , and Ukrainian republics . Petitions , literature , and occasional public demonstrations voiced public demands for the human rights of all nationalities . By the end of the 1970s , however , massive and concerted efforts by the KGB had largely suppressed the national dissent movement . Nevertheless , Brezhnev had learned his lesson . Proposals to dismantle the federative system were abandoned in favour of a policy of drawing the nationalities together more gradually . </P> <P> Soviet officials identified religion closely with nationality . The implementation of policy toward a particular religion , therefore , depended on the regime 's perception of the bond between that religion and the nationality practicing it , the size of the religious community , the extent to which the religion accepted outside authority , and the nationality 's willingness to subordinate itself to political authority . Thus the smaller the religious community and the more closely it identified with a particular nationality , the more restrictive were the regime 's policies , especially if the religion also recognized a foreign authority such as the pope . </P> <H3> Policy towards Orthodoxy ( edit ) </H3> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> This section does not cite any sources .

During the first five years of Soviet power , the Bolsheviks executed 28 Russian Orthodox bishops and over 1,200 Russian Orthodox priests . Many others were imprisoned or exiled . Believers were harassed and persecuted . Most seminaries were closed , and the publication of most religious material was prohibited . By 1941 only 500 churches remained open out of about 54,000 in existence prior to World War I . </P> <P> Such crackdowns related to many people 's dissatisfaction with the church in pre-revolutionary Russia . The close ties between the church and the state led to the perception of the church as corrupt and greedy by many members of the intelligentsia . Many peasants , while highly religious , also viewed the church unfavorably . Respect for religion did not extend to the local priests . The church owned a significant portion of Russia 's land , and this was a bone of contention -- land ownership was a big factor in the Russian Revolution of 1917 . </P> <P> The Nazi attack on the Soviet Union in 1941 induced Stalin to enlist the Russian Orthodox Church as an ally to arouse Russian patriotism against foreign aggression . Russian Orthodox religious life experienced a revival : thousands of churches were reopened ; there were 22,000 by the time Nikita Khrushchev came to power . The regime permitted religious publications , and church membership grew . </P> <P> Khrushchev reversed the regime 's policy of cooperation with the Russian Orthodox Church . Although it remained officially sanctioned , in 1959 Khrushchev launched an antireligious campaign that was continued in a less stringent manner by his successor , Brezhnev . By 1975 the number of active Russian Orthodox churches was reduced to 7,000 . Some of the most prominent members of the Russian Orthodox hierarchy and some activists were jailed or forced to leave the church . Their place was taken by docile clergy who were obedient to the state and who were sometimes infiltrated by KGB agents , making the Russian Orthodox Church useful to the regime . It espoused and propagated Soviet foreign policy and furthered the russification of non-Russian Christians , such as Orthodox Ukrainians and Belarusians . </P> <P> The regime applied a different policy toward the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church and the Belarusian Autocephalous Orthodox Church . Viewed by the government as very nationalistic , both were suppressed , first at the end of the 1920s and again in 1944 after they had renewed themselves under German occupation . The leadership of both churches was decimated ; large numbers of priests were shot or sent to labor camps , and members of their congregations were harassed and persecuted . </P> <P> The Georgian Orthodox Church was subject to a somewhat different policy and fared far worse than the Russian Orthodox Church . During World War II , however , it was allowed greater autonomy in running its affairs in return for calling its members to support the war effort , although it did not achieve the kind of accommodation with the authorities that the Russian Orthodox Church had . The government reimposed tight control over it after the war . Out of some 2,100 churches in 1917 , only 200 were still open in the 1980s , and it was forbidden to serve its adherents outside the Georgian Republic . In many cases , the regime forced the Georgian Orthodox Church to conduct services in Old Church Slavonic instead of in the Georgian language . </P> <H3> Policy towards Catholicism and protestantism ( edit ) </H3> <P> The Soviet government 's policies toward the Catholic Church were strongly influenced by Soviet Catholics ' recognition of an outside authority as head of their church . As a result of World War II , millions of Catholics ( including Greco - Catholics ) became Soviet citizens and were subjected to new repression . Also , in the three republics where most of the Catholics lived , the Lithuanian SSR , the Byelorussian SSR and the Ukrainian SSR , Catholicism and nationalism were closely linked . Although the Roman Catholic Church was tolerated in Lithuania , large numbers of the clergy were imprisoned , many seminaries were closed , and police agents infiltrated the remainder . The anti-Catholic campaign in Lithuania abated after Stalin 's death , but harsh measures against the church were resumed in 1957 and continued through the Brezhnev era . </P> <P> Soviet policy was particularly harsh toward the Ukrainian Greek - Catholic Church . Ukrainian Greek - Catholics came under Soviet rule in 1939 , when western Ukraine was incorporated into the Soviet Union as part of the Nazi - Soviet Nonaggression Pact . Although the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church was permitted to function , it was almost immediately subjected to intense harassment . Retreating before the German army in 1941 , Soviet authorities arrested large numbers of Ukrainian Greek Catholic priests , who were either killed or deported to Siberia . After the Red Army reoccupied western Ukraine in 1944 , the Soviet regime liquidated the Ukrainian Greek - Catholic Church by arresting its metropolitan , all of its bishops , hundreds of clergy , and the more active church members , killing some and sending the rest to labor camps . At the same time , Soviet authorities forced the remaining clergy to abrogate the union with Rome and subordinate themselves to the Russian Orthodox Church . </P> <P> Before World War II , there were fewer Protestants in the Soviet Union than adherents of other faiths , but they showed remarkable growth since then . In 1944 the Soviet government established the All - Union Council of Evangelical Christian Baptists ( now the Union of Evangelical Christians - Baptists of Russia ) to gain some control over the various Protestant sects . Many congregations refused to join this body , however , and others that initially joined it subsequently left . All found that the state , through the council , was interfering in church life . </P> <H3> Policy toward other Christian groups ( edit ) </H3> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> This section does not cite any sources . Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources . Unsourced material may be challenged and removed . ( June 2011 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> A number of congregations of Russian Mennonites , Jehovah 's Witnesses , and other Christian groups faced varying levels of persecution under Soviet rule . </P> <P> Jehovah 's Witnesses were banned from practicing their religion . Under Operation North , the personal property of over eight - thousand members was confiscated , and they ( along with underage children ) were exiled to Siberia from 1951 until repeal in 1965 . All were asked to sign a declaration of resignation as a Jehovah 's Witness in order to not be deported . There is no existing record of any having signed this declaration . While in Siberia , some men , women , and children were forced to work as lumberjacks for a fixed wage . Victims reported living conditions to be very poor . From 1951 to 1991 , Jehovah 's Witnesses within and outside Siberia were incarcerated -- and then rearrested after serving their terms . Some were forced to work in concentration camps , others forcibly enrolled in Marxist reeducation programs . KGB officials infiltrated the Jehovah 's Witnesses organization in the Soviet Union , mostly to seek out hidden caches of theological literature . Soviet propaganda films depicted Jehovah 's Witnesses as a cult , extremist , and engaging in mind control . Jehovah 's Witnesses were legalized in the Soviet Union in 1991 ; victims were given social benefits equivalent to those of war veterans . </P> <P> Early in the Bolshevik period , predominantly before the end of the Russian Civil War and the emergence of the Soviet Union , Russian Mennonite communities were harassed ; several Mennonites were killed or imprisoned , and women were raped . Anarcho - Communist Nestor Makhno was responsible for most of the bloodshed , which caused the normally pacifist Mennonites to take up arms in defensive militia units . This marked the beginning of a mass exodus of Mennonites to Germany , the United States , and elsewhere . Mennonites were branded as kulaks by the Soviets . Their colonies ' farms were collectivized under the Soviet Union 's communal farming policy . Being predominantly German settlers , the Russian Mennonites in World War II saw the German forces invading Russia as liberators . Many were allowed passage to Germany as Volksdeutsche . Soviet officials began exiling Mennonite settlers in the eastern part of Russia to Siberia . After the war , the remaining Russian Mennonites were branded as Nazi conspirators and exiled to Kazakhstan and Siberia , sometimes being imprisoned or forced to work in concentration camps . In the 1990s the Russian government gave the Mennonites in Kazakhstan and Siberia the opportunity to emigrate . </P> <H3> Policy towards Islam ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Islam in the Soviet Union <P> Soviet policy toward Islam was affected , on the one hand by the large Muslim population , its close ties to national cultures , and its tendency to accept Soviet authority , and on the other hand by its susceptibility to foreign influence . Although actively encouraging atheism , Soviet authorities permitted some limited religious activity in all the Muslim republics , under the auspices of the regional branches of the Spiritual Administration of the Muslims of the USSR . Mosques functioned in most large cities of the Central Asian republics and the Azerbaijan Republic , but their number decreased from 25,000 in 1917 to 500 in the 1970s . Under Stalinist rule , Soviet authorities cracked down on Muslim clergy , closing many mosques or turning them into warehouses . In 1989 , as part of the general relaxation of restrictions on religions , some additional Muslim religious associations were registered , and some of the mosques that had been closed by the government were returned to Muslim communities . The government also announced plans to permit the training of limited numbers of Muslim religious leaders in two - and five - year courses in Ufa and Baku , respectively . </P> <H3> Policy towards Judaism ( edit ) </H3> Main article : History of the Jews in Russia and the Soviet Union <P> Although Lenin publicly condemned anti-Semitism , the regime was hostile toward Judaism from the beginning . In 1919 the Soviet authorities abolished Jewish community councils , which were traditionally responsible for maintaining synagogues . They created a special Jewish section of the party , whose tasks included propaganda against Jewish clergy and religion . To offset Jewish national and religious aspirations , and to reflect the Jewish national movement 's role in the socialist movement of the Russian Empire ( for example , Trotsky was first a member of the Jewish Bund , not the Social Democratic Labour Party ) , an alternative to the Land of Israel was established in 1934 . </P> <P> The Jewish Autonomous Oblast , created in 1928 by Stalin , with Birobidzhan in the Russian Far East as its administrative center , was to become a `` Soviet Zion '' . Yiddish , rather than `` reactionary '' Hebrew , would be the national language , and proletarian socialist literature and arts would replace Judaism as the quintessence of its culture . Despite a massive domestic and international state propaganda campaign , the Jewish population there never reached 30 % ( as of 2003 it was only about 1.2 % ) . The experiment ended in the mid-1930s , during Stalin 's first campaign of purges . Jewish leaders were arrested and executed , and Yiddish schools were shut down . Further persecutions and purges followed . </P> <P> The training of rabbis became impossible until early 1940 's , and until the late 1980s only one Yiddish periodical was published . Because of its identification with Zionism , Hebrew was taught only in schools for diplomats . Most of the 5,000 synagogues functioning prior to the Bolshevik Revolution were closed under Stalin , and others were closed under Khrushchev . The practice of Judaism became very difficult , intensifying the desire of Jews to leave the Soviet Union . </P> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Index of Soviet Union - related articles </Li> <Li> Council for Religious Affairs </Li> <Li> Culture of the Soviet Union </Li> <Li> Demographics of the Soviet Union </Li> <Li> Soviet anti-religious legislation </Li> <Li> Soviet Anti-Catholic Campaigns </Li> <Li> Persecution of Christians in Warsaw Pact countries </Li> <Li> Persecution of Christians in the Soviet Union </Li> <Li> Persecutions of the Catholic Church and Pius XII </Li> <Li> USSR anti-religious campaign ( 1917 -- 1921 ) </Li> <Li> USSR anti-religious campaign ( 1921 -- 1928 ) </Li> <Li> USSR anti-religious campaign ( 1928 -- 1941 ) </Li> <Li> USSR anti-religious campaign ( 1958 -- 1964 ) </Li> <Li> USSR anti-religious campaign ( 1970s -- 1990 ) </Li> <Li> Eastern Catholic victims of Soviet persecutions </Li> <Li> Persecution of Muslims in the former USSR </Li> <Li> Persecution of Jehovah 's Witnesses in the Soviet Union </Li> <Li> Soviet Orientalist studies in Islam </Li> <Li> Religion in Russia </Li> <Li> Bezbozhnik </Li> <Li> Enemy of the people </Li> <Li> Russification </Li> <Li> Sovietization </Li> <Li> Red Terror </Li> </Ul> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <P> Notes </P> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ Arto Luukkanen ( 1994 ) .
