Fusing to the egg usually causes little problem , whereas penetrating through the egg 's hard shell or extracellular matrix can present more of a problem to the sperm . Therefore , sperm cells go through a process known as the acrosome reaction which is the reaction that occurs in the acrosome of the sperm as it approaches the egg . The acrosome is a cap - like structure over the anterior half of the sperm 's head . </P> <P> As the sperm approaches the zona pellucida of the egg , which is necessary for initiating the acrosome reaction , the membrane surrounding the acrosome fuses with the plasma membrane of the sperm 's head , exposing the contents of the acrosome . The contents include surface antigens necessary for binding to the egg 's cell membrane , and numerous enzymes which are responsible for breaking through the egg 's tough coating and allowing fertilization to occur . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Variations among species <Ul> <Li> 1.1 Echinoderms </Li> <Li> 1.2 Mammals </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 The process </Li> <Li> 3 In in vitro fertilization <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Assessment </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 See also </Li> <Li> 5 References </Li> <Li> 6 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Variations among species ( edit ) </H2> <P> There are considerable species variations in the morphology and consequences of the acrosome reaction . In several species the trigger for the acrosome reaction has been identified in a layer that surrounds the egg . </P> <H3> Echinoderms ( edit ) </H3> <P> In some lower animal species a protuberance ( the acrosomal process ) forms at the apex of the sperm head , supported by a core of actin microfilaments . The membrane at the tip of the acrosomal process fuses with the egg 's plasma membrane . </P> <P> In some echinoderms , including starfish and sea urchins , a major portion of the exposed acrosomal content contains a protein that temporarily holds the sperm on the egg 's surface . </P> <H3> Mammals ( edit ) </H3> <P> In mammals the acrosome reaction releases hyaluronidase and acrosin ; their role in fertilization is not yet clear . The acrosomal reaction does not begin until the sperm comes into contact with the oocyte 's zona pellucida . Upon coming into contact with the zona pellucida , the acrosomal enzymes begin to dissolve and the actin filament comes into contact with the zona pellucida . Once the two meet , a calcium influx occurs , causing a signaling cascade . The cortical granules inside the oocyte then fuse to the outer membrane and a transient fast block reaction occurs . </P> <P> It also alters a patch of pre-existing sperm plasma membrane so that it can fuse with the egg plasma membrane . </P> <P> A sperm penetration assay includes an acrosome reaction test that assesses how well a sperm is able to perform during the fertilization process . Sperm that are unable to properly go through the acrosome reaction will not be able to fertilize an egg . However , this problem only occurs in about 5 % of men that have the test done . This test is rather expensive and provides limited information on a man 's fertility . </P> <P> In other cases , such as in the wood mouse Apodemus sylvaticus , premature acrosome reactions have been found to cause increased motility in aggregates of spermatozoa promoting fertilization </P> <H2> The process ( edit ) </H2> <P> The acrosomal reaction normally takes place in the ampulla of the fallopian tube ( site of fertilization ) when the sperm penetrates the secondary oocyte . A few events precede the actual acrosome reaction . The sperm cell acquires a `` hyperactive motility pattern '' by which its flagellum produces vigorous whip - like movements that propel the sperm through the cervical canal and uterine cavity , until it reaches the isthmus of the fallopian tube . The sperm approaches the ovum in the ampulla of the fallopian tube with the help of various mechanisms , including chemotaxis . Glycoproteins on the outer surface of the sperm then bind with glycoproteins on the zona pellucida of the ovum . </P> <P> The first stage is the penetration of corona radiata , by releasing hyaluronidase from the acrosome to digest cumulus cells surrounding the oocyte and exposing acrosin attached to the inner membrane of the sperm . The cumulus cells are embedded in a gel - like substance made primarily of hyaluronic acid , and developed in the ovary with the egg and support it as it grows . After reaching the zona pellucida the actual acrosome reaction begins . </P> <P> Acrosin digests the zona pellucida and membrane of the oocyte . Part of the sperm 's cell membrane then fuses with the egg cell 's membrane , and the contents of the head sink into the egg . In the mouse it has been demonstrated that ZP3 , one of the proteins that make up the zona pellucida , binds to a partner molecule ( to the \u03b21 , 4 - galactosyl transferase receptors ) on the sperm . This lock - and - key type mechanism is species - specific and prevents the sperm and egg of different species from fusing . The zona pellucida also releases Ca granules to prevent additional sperm from binding . There is some evidence that this binding is what triggers the acrosome to release the enzymes that allow the sperm to fuse with the egg . It is likely that a similar mechanism occurs in other mammals , but the diversity of zona proteins across species means that the relevant protein and receptor may differ . </P> <P> Upon penetration , if all is occurring normally , the process of egg - activation occurs and the oocyte is said to have become activated . This is thought to be induced by a specific protein phospholipase c zeta . It undergoes its secondary meiotic division , and the two haploid nuclei ( paternal and maternal ) fuse to form a zygote . In order to prevent polyspermy and minimise the possibility of producing a triploid zygote , several changes to the egg 's cell membranes renders them impenetrable shortly after the first sperm enters the egg . </P> <P> The aforementioned process describes the physiologically relevant events . One should however bear in mind that a certain percentage of sperm cells will undergo a spontaneous acrosome reaction without the presence of the ovum . Those cells are not able to fertilise the egg , even if they do reach it later . Other cells will spontaneously shed their acrosome during the process of apoptosis / necrosis . </P> <H2> In in vitro fertilization ( edit ) </H2> <P> When using intracytoplasmic sperm injection ( ICSI ) for IVF , the implantation rate is higher in oocytes injected with spermatozoa that have undergone acrosome reaction ( ~ 40 % ) vs. those injected with nonreacted spermatozoa ( ~ 10 % ) . The implantation rate is ~ 25 % in when injected with both reacted and nonreacted spermatozoa . The delivery rate per cycle follows the same trend . </P> <P> The acrosome reaction can be stimulated in vitro by substances a sperm cell may encounter naturally such as progesterone or follicular fluid , as well as the more commonly used calcium ionophore A23187 . </P> <H3> Assessment ( edit ) </H3> <P> Birefringence microscopy , flow cytometry or fluorescence microscopy can be used for assessing the shedding of the acrosome or `` acrosome reaction '' of a sperm sample . Flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy are usually done after staining with a fluoresceinated lectin such as FITC - PNA , FITC - PSA , FITC - ConA , or fluoresceinated antibody such as FITC - CD46 . The antibodies / lectins have a high specificity for different parts of the acrosomal region , and will only bind to a specific site ( acrosomal content / inner / outer membrane ) . If bound to a fluorescent molecule , regions where these probes have bound can be visualised . Sperm cells with artificially induced acrosome reactions may serve as positive controls . </P> <P> For fluorescence microscopy a smear of washed sperm cells are made , airdried , permealized and then stained . Such a slide is then viewed under light of a wavelength that will cause the probe to fluoresce if it is bound to the acrosomal region . At least 200 cells are viewed in an arbitrary fashion and classified as either acrosome intact ( fluorescing bright green ) or acrosome reacted ( no probe present , or only on the equatorial region ) . It is then expressed as a percentage of the counted cells . </P> <P> For assessment with flow cytometry the washed cells are incubated with the chosen probe , ( possibly washed again ) and then sampled in a flow cytometer . After gating the cell population according to forward - and side - scatter the resulting data can be analysed ( E.g. mean fluorescences compared ) . With this technique a probe for viability , like propidium iodide ( PI ) could also be included in order to exclude dead cells from the acrosome assessment , since many sperm cells will spontaneously lose their acrosome when they die . </P> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Cortical reaction </Li> <Li> Hamster zona - free ovum test </Li> <Li> ZP3 </Li> </Ul> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ Swiss Virtual Campus . `` Chapter 4 , Fertilization '' .
