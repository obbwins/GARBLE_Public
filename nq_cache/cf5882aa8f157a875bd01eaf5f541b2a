The zombie angle also allowed Fresco to explore the concept of Narcissism stating that `` the undead are the ultimate narcissists . They want what they want when they want it and will do anything to just have what they want and do n't care about other people 's needs '' </P> <P> For the setting Fresco drew from his own experience growing up in San Fernando Valley . Santa Clarita was chosen because of its middle class inhabitants . The Hammonds ' profession of realtors was chosen because `` It gets them out into the world '' as well as the `` forced friendliness '' inherent to the profession . </P> <H3> Advertising controversy ( edit ) </H3> <P> In February 2017 , advertising for the show sparked criticism in Germany , where Netflix promoted the show with posters depicting a human finger sliced up like a currywurst , a popular German fast food dish . After receiving more than 50 complaints that the advertising was glorifying violence and inducing fear , especially in children , the German Advertising Council , a self - regulatory institution , forwarded the complaints to the company . Netflix then decided to end the campaign and remove all posters . </P> <H2> Critical reception ( edit ) </H2> <P> The first season of Santa Clarita Diet received generally positive reviews from critics . On Rotten Tomatoes , the season has an approval rating of 75 % based on 64 reviews , with an average rating of 7.18 / 10 . The site 's critical consensus reads , `` Santa Clarita Diet serves up an excellent cast , frequent laughs , and an engaging premise -- but the level of gore might not be to everyone 's taste . '' Metacritic reports that the first season received `` generally favorable reviews '' with a score of 67 out of 100 , based on 30 critics . </P> <P> The second season received generally positive reviews as well . The season holds a score of 82 % based on 11 reviews , with an average rating of 7.08 / 10 on Rotten Tomatoes . The site 's critical consensus states : `` Santa Clarita Diet rides the momentum of its freshman season with non-stop comedic gore and a big heart that bleeds -- profusely -- for its lovable characters .
