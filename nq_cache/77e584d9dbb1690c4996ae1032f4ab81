{"document_text": "Ai n't - wikipedia <H1> Ai n't </H1> Jump to : navigation , search <P> Ai n't is a contraction for am not , is not , are not , has not , and have not in the common English language vernacular . In some dialects ai n't is also used as a contraction of do not , does not , and did not . The development of ai n't for the various forms of to be not , to have not , and to do not occurred independently , at different times . The usage of ai n't for the forms of to be not was established by the mid-18th century , and for the forms of to have not by the early 19th century . </P> <P> The usage of ai n't is a continuing subject of controversy in English . Ai n't is commonly used by many speakers in oral and informal settings , especially in certain regions and dialects . Its usage is often highly stigmatized , and it can be used by the general public as a marker of low socio - economic or regional status or education level . Its use is generally considered non-standard by dictionaries and style guides except when used for rhetorical effect . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Etymology <Ul> <Li> 1.1 Contractions of to be not </Li> <Li> 1.2 Contractions of to have not </Li> <Li> 1.3 Contractions of to do not </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 Linguistic characteristics </Li> <Li> 3 Prescription and stigma </Li> <Li> 4 Regional usage and dialects </Li> <Li> 5 Rhetorical and popular usage </Li> <Li> 6 Notable usage </Li> <Li> 7 See also </Li> <Li> 8 References </Li> <Li> 9 Further reading </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Etymology ( edit ) </H2> <P> Ai n't has several antecedents in English , corresponding to the various forms of to be not and to have not that ai n't contracts . The development of ai n't for to be not and to have not is a diachronic coincidence ; in other words , they were independent developments at different times . </P> <H3> Contractions of to be not ( edit ) </H3> <P> Am n't as a contraction of am not is known from 1618 . As the `` mn '' combination of two nasal consonants is disfavoured by many English speakers , the `` m '' of am n't began to be elided , reflected in writing with the new form a n't . Are n't as a contraction for are not first appeared in 1675 . In non-rhotic dialects , are n't lost its `` r '' sound , and began to be pronounced as a n't . </P> <P> A n't ( sometimes a' n't ) arose from am not and are not almost simultaneously . A n't first appears in print in the work of English Restoration playwrights . In 1695 a n't was used as a contraction of `` am not '' , in William Congreve 's play Love for Love : `` I can hear you farther off , I a n't deaf '' . But as early as 1696 Sir John Vanbrugh uses a n't to mean `` are not '' in The Relapse : `` Hark thee shoemaker ! These shoes a n't ugly , but they do n't fit me '' . </P> <P> A n't for is not may have developed independently from its use for am not and are not . Is n't was sometimes written as i n't or e n't , which could have changed into a n't . A n't for is not may also have filled a gap as an extension of the already - used conjugations for to be not . Jonathan Swift used a n't to mean is not in Letter 19 of his Journal to Stella ( 1710 -- 13 ) : It a n't my fault , ' tis Patrick 's fault ; pray now do n't blame Presto . </P> <P> A n't with a long `` a '' sound began to be written as ai n't , which first appears in writing in 1749 . By the time ai n't appeared , a n't was already being used for am not , are not , and is not . A n't and ai n't coexisted as written forms well into the nineteenth century -- Charles Dickens used the terms interchangeably , as in Chapter 13 , Book the Second of Little Dorrit ( 1857 ) : `` ' I guessed it was you , Mr Pancks '' , said she , ' for it 's quite your regular night ; ai n't it ? ... A n't it gratifying , Mr Pancks , though ; really ? ' `` . In the English lawyer William Hickey 's memoirs ( 1808 -- 1810 ) , ai n't appears as a contraction of are n't ; `` thank God we 're all alive , ai n't we ... '' </P> <H3> Contractions of to have not ( edit ) </H3> <P> Ha n't or ha' n't , an early contraction for has not and have not , developed from the elision of the `` s '' of has not and the `` v '' of have not . Ha n't appeared in the work of English Restoration playwrights , as in The Country Wife ( 1675 ) by William Wycherley : Gentlemen and Ladies , ha n't you all heard the late sad report / of poor Mr. Horner . Much like a n't , ha n't was sometimes pronounced with a long `` a '' , yielding hai n't . With H - dropping , the `` h '' of ha n't or hai n't gradually disappeared in most dialects , and became ai n't . </P> <P> Ai n't as a contraction for has not / have not first appeared in dictionaries in the 1830s , and appeared in 1819 in Niles ' Weekly Register : Strike ! Why I ai n't got nobody here to strike ... Charles Dickens likewise used ai n't to mean have n't in Chapter 28 of Martin Chuzzlewit ( 1844 ) : `` You ai n't got nothing to cry for , bless you ! He 's righter than a trivet ! '' </P> <P> Like with a n't , ha n't and ai n't were found together late into the nineteenth century , as in Chapter 12 of Dickens ' Our Mutual Friend : `` ' Well , have you finished ? ' asked the strange man . ' No , ' said Riderhood , ' I ai n't ' ... ' You sir ! You ha n't said what you want of me . ' '' </P> <H3> Contractions of to do not ( edit ) </H3> <P> Ai n't meaning did n't is widely considered a feature unique to African American Vernacular English , although it can be found in some dialects of Caribbean English as well . It may function not as a true variant of did n't , but as a creole - like tense - neutral negator ( sometimes termed `` generic ai n't '' ) . Its origin may have been due to approximation when early African Americans acquired English as a second language ; it is also possible that early African Americans inherited this variation from colonial European - Americans , and later kept the variation when it largely passed out of wider usage . Ai n't is rarely attested for the present - tense constructions do not or does not . </P> <H2> Linguistic characteristics ( edit ) </H2> <P> Linguistically , ai n't is formed by the same rule that English speakers use to form are n't and other contractions of auxiliary verbs . Most linguists consider usage of ai n't to be grammatical , as long as its users convey their intended meaning to their audience . In other words , a sentence such as `` She ai n't got no sense '' is grammatical because it generally follows a native speaker 's word order , and because a native speaker would recognize the meaning of that sentence . Linguists draw a distinction , however , between grammaticality and acceptability : what may be considered grammatical across all dialects may nevertheless be considered not acceptable in certain dialects or contexts . The usage of ai n't is socially unacceptable in some situations . </P> <P> Functionally , ai n't has operated in part to plug what is known as the `` am n't gap '' -- the anomalous situation in standard English whereby there are standard contractions for other forms of to be not ( are n't for are not , and is n't for is not ) , but no standard contraction for am not . Historically , ai n't has filled the gap where one might expect am n't , even in contexts where other uses of ai n't were disfavored . Standard dialects that regard ai n't as non-standard often substitute are n't for am not in tag questions ( e.g. , `` I 'm doing okay , are n't I ? '' ) , while leaving the `` am n't gap '' open in declarative statements . </P> <H2> Prescription and stigma ( edit ) </H2> <P> Ai n't has been called `` the most stigmatized word in the language '' , as well as `` the most powerful social marker '' in English . It is a prominent example in English of a shibboleth -- a word used to determine inclusion in , or exclusion from , a group . </P> <P> Historically , this was not the case . For most of its history , ai n't was acceptable across many social and regional contexts . Throughout the 17th , 18th , and 19th centuries , ai n't and its predecessors were part of normal usage for both educated and uneducated English speakers , and was found in the correspondence and fiction of , among others , Jonathan Swift , Lord Byron , Henry Fielding , and George Eliot . For Victorian English novelists William Makepeace Thackeray and Anthony Trollope , the educated and upper classes in 19th century England could use ai n't freely , but in familiar speech only . Ai n't continued to be used without restraint by many upper middle class speakers in southern England into the beginning of the 20th century . </P> <P> Ai n't was a prominent target of early prescriptivist writers . In the 18th and early 19th centuries , some writers began to propound the need to establish a `` pure '' or `` correct '' form of English . Contractions in general were disapproved of , but ai n't and its variants were seen as particularly `` vulgar '' . This push for `` correctness '' was driven mainly by the middle class , which led to an incongruous situation in which non-standard constructions continued to be used by both lower and upper classes , but not by the middle class . The reason for the strength of the prescription against ai n't is not entirely clear . </P> <P> The strong prescription against ai n't in standard English has led to many misconceptions , often expressed jocularly ( or ironically ) , as `` ai n't ai n't a word '' or `` ai n't ai n't in the dictionary . '' Ai n't is listed in most dictionaries , including the Oxford Dictionary of English and Merriam - Webster . However , Oxford states `` it does not form part of standard English and should never be used in formal or written contexts '' , and Merriam - Webster states it is `` widely disapproved as non-standard and more common in the habitual speech of the less educated '' . </P> <P> Webster 's Third New International Dictionary , published in 1961 , went against then - standard practice when it included the following usage note in its entry on ai n't : `` though disapproved by many and more common in less educated speech , used orally in most parts of the U.S. by many cultivated speakers esp. in the phrase ai n't I . '' Many commentators disapproved of the dictionary 's relatively permissive attitude toward the word , which was inspired , in part , by the belief of its editor , Philip Gove , that `` distinctions of usage were elitist and artificial '' . </P> <H2> Regional usage and dialects ( edit ) </H2> From Mark Twain , Life on the Mississippi , 1883 <P> Ai n't is found throughout the English - speaking world across regions and classes , and is among the most pervasive nonstandard terms in English . It is one of two negation features ( the other being the double negative ) that are known to appear in all nonstandard English dialects . Ai n't is used throughout the United Kingdom , with its geographical distribution increasing over time . It is also found throughout the United States , including in Appalachia , the South , New England , the Mid-Atlantic , and the Upper Midwest . In its geographical ubiquity , ai n't is to be contrasted with other folk usages such as y'all , which is confined to the South region of the United States . </P> <P> In England , ai n't is generally considered a non-standard or illiterate usage , as it is used by speakers of a lower socio - economic class , or by educated people in an informal manner . In the nineteenth century , ai n't was often used by writers to denote regional dialects such as Cockney English . Ai n't is a non-standard feature commonly found in mainstream Australian English , and in New Zealand , ai n't is a feature of M\u0101ori - influenced English . In American English , usage of ai n't corresponds to a middle level of education , although it is widely believed that its use establishes of lack of education or social standing in the speaker . </P> <P> The usage of ai n't in the southern United States is distinctive , however , in the continued usage of the word by well - educated , cultivated speakers . Ai n't is in common usage of educated Southerners . In the South , the use of ai n't can be used as a marker to separate cultured speakers from those who lack confidence in their social standing and thus avoid its use entirely . </P> An American propaganda poster from World War II , using ai n't for rhetorical effect <H2> Rhetorical and popular usage ( edit ) </H2> <P> Ai n't can be used in both speech and writing to catch attention and to give emphasis , as in `` Ai n't that a crying shame '' , or `` If it ai n't broke , do n't fix it . '' Merriam - Webster 's Collegiate Dictionary gives an example from film critic Richard Schickel : `` the wackiness of movies , once so deliciously amusing , ai n't funny anymore . '' It can also be used deliberately for what The Oxford Dictionary of American Usage and Style describes as `` tongue - in - cheek '' or `` reverse snobbery '' . Star baseball pitcher Dizzy Dean , a member of the Baseball Hall of Fame and later a popular announcer , once said , `` A lot of people who do n't say ai n't , ai n't eatin ' . '' </P> <P> Although ai n't is seldom found in formal writing , it is frequently used in more informal written settings , such as popular song lyrics . In genres such as traditional country music , blues , rock n ' roll , and hip - hop , lyrics often include nonstandard features such as ai n't . This is principally due to the use of such features as markers of `` covert identity and prestige '' . </P> <P> Ai n't is standard in some fixed phrases , such as `` You ai n't seen nothing yet '' . </P> <H2> Notable usage ( edit ) </H2> `` You Ai n't Heard Nothing Yet '' , 1919 <Ul> <Li> `` Ai n't I a Woman ? '' , 1851 speech by abolitionist Sojourner Truth . </Li> <Li> `` If you want to know who we are '' , from The Mikado lyrics by W.S. Gilbert `` We figure in lively paint : Our attitude 's queer and quaint -- You 're wrong if you think it ai n't . '' ( 1885 ) . </Li> <Li> George Bernard Shaw 's play Pygmalion `` I ai n't done nothing wrong by speaking to the gentleman '' said Cockney flower girl Eliza Doolittle . </Li> <Li> Great baseball hitter Willie Keeler 's advice to young hitters was : `` Keep your eye on the ball , and hit ' em where they ai n't . '' </Li> <Li> `` Say it ai n't so , Joe '' , apocryphal quote from a young baseball fan to Shoeless Joe Jackson after the fan learned about the Black Sox scandal involving throwing the 1919 World Series . `` Say it ai n't so '' was subsequently used as the title of a song by Weezer and an album by Murray Head , and an opera about the 2008 US vice presidential debate . </Li> <Li> `` You ai n't heard nothing yet ! '' spoken by Al Jolson in The Jazz Singer ( 1927 ) , the first feature - length motion picture with synchronized dialogue sequences . That spoken line , and others in the film , introduced the `` talkies '' and revolutionized the movie industry . </Li> <Li> `` It Ai n't Necessarily So '' , song from Porgy and Bess ( 1935 ) ; music by George Gershwin , words by Ira Gershwin . </Li> <Li> `` He ai n't heavy , he 's my brother '' has been used as the motto of Boys Town since 1943 , and inspired a song He Ai n't Heavy , He 's My Brother , written by Bobby Scott and Bob Russell , and recorded by The Hollies , Neil Diamond , and other artists . </Li> <Li> `` Ai n't That a Shame '' is a song written by Fats Domino and Dave Bartholomew , released by Imperial Records in 1955 , which went on to sell over a million copies and introduced Fats Domino to a wider audience . </Li> <Li> Winston Churchill , commenting on the 1954 portrait by Graham Sutherland said `` It makes me look half - witted , which I ai n't '' . </Li> <Li> Ai n't No Mountain High Enough sung by Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell . </Li> </Ul> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> English auxiliaries and contractions </Li> <Li> English usage controversies </Li> </Ul> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ Cheshire , Jenny ( 2009 ) .
