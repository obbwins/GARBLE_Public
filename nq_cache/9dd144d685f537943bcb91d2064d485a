One day his mother drops him off at a Christian camp where he meets Shannon . Upon his return from camp , Bart finds his mother has left and movers are removing her belongings . He angrily confronts his father , who denies that his abusiveness was the reason she left . </P> <P> Years later , in high school , Bart and Shannon are dating . Bart plays football to please his father , but is injured , breaking both ankles and ending his career . The only elective with openings is music class , so he reluctantly signs up . Initially , Bart is assigned to be a sound technician , but after overhearing him singing , the director casts him in the lead role in the school production of Oklahoma . Bart overcomes his reluctance and gives an impressive performance , but does not tell his father , who finds out the night of the show when he happens to see a flyer for the show in a diner . Arthur suddenly collapses in pain , and finds out he has cancer , which he hides from Bart . The following morning , Bart antagonizes his father , who smashes a plate over his head . At church , Shannon sees the blood and presses Bart to open up , but he responds by breaking up with her , and leaves town to seek his fortune in the city . </P> <P> He joins a band in need of a singer , and convinces Christian music producer Scott Brickell to manage the band and secure a showcase in Nashville . Bart surprises Shannon and invites her to tour with the band , and is confused when she flatly refuses . In Nashville , Brickell introduces Bart to established artists Amy Grant and Michael W. Smith , but is unable to convince several record execs to sign the band , who do not believe the band , now performing as `` MercyMe '' , is good enough . Devastated , Bart quits the band , but Brickell perceives that Bart needs to resolve issues in his personal life , so Bart reconciles with the band and asks them to wait for him , and leaves to return home . </P> <P> Bart returns home late at night and is confused to find that his father has prepared breakfast for him the next morning . His father claims to have become a Christian , but Bart is skeptical and refuses to forgive him , and leaves . In anger and despair , Arthur smashes his old Jeep , which he had asked Bart to help him restore . Bart attempts to drive away in his father 's pickup , but discovers the terminal cancer diagnosis , and returns to his father . He finally forgives his father , and the two form a deep bond , but Arthur soon dies of his illness . </P> <P> After Arthur 's funeral , Bart rejoins the band and writes `` I Can Only Imagine '' , and also calls Shannon and apologizes for the first time since their breakup . Brickell sends the demo tape to several artists , including Grant , who , deeply moved by the song , asks to record it herself as her next single , and Bart , who just wants the song to be heard , accepts . Grant begins the song , but ca n't bring herself to sing it , and calls Bart on stage from the audience to sing it himself . Bart 's performance earns an enthusiastic ovation , and he reunites with Shannon , who was also in attendance . The band releases the song as their first single , achieving success on both Christian and mainstream radio . </P> <H2> Cast ( edit ) </H2> This list is incomplete ; you can help by expanding it . <Ul> <Li> J.

'' On Metacritic , the film has a weighted average score of 30 out of 100 , based on 8 critics , indicating `` generally unfavorable reviews '' . The Arizona Republic 's James Ward gave the film 4 / 5 stars and wrote , `` Too often faith - based films -- say anything with Kirk Cameron or the terrible God 's Not Dead series -- tend to preach to the choir or hector their audience . The Erwins ' films -- I Can Only Imagine definitely among them -- are more inclusive , charitable of spirit and hopeful , all qualities that are always appreciated , be they rooted in Christian faith or otherwise . '' David Ehrlich of IndieWire gave the film a `` C -- '' saying : `` There 's a reason why all of these movies are so amateurishly made ; why they all end with links to religious websites ; why they all look like they were shot on an iPhone by a Walmart - brand Janusz Kaminski who lit each interior like the white light of heaven was streaming through every window ... Art can be affirmation , but affirmation can not be art .
