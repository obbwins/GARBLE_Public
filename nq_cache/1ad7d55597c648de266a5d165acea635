{"document_text": "Christianisation of Anglo - Saxon England - wikipedia <H1> Christianisation of Anglo - Saxon England </H1> <P> The Christianisation of Anglo - Saxon England was a process spanning the 7th century . It was essentially the result of the Gregorian mission of 597 , which was joined by the efforts of the Hiberno - Scottish mission from the 630s . From the 8th century , the Anglo - Saxon mission was in turn instrumental in the conversion of the population of the Frankish Empire . </P> <P> \u00c6thelberht of Kent was the first king to accept baptism , circa 601 . He was followed by Saebert of Essex and R\u00e6dwald of East Anglia in 604 . However , when \u00c6thelberht and Saebert died , in 616 , they were both succeeded by pagan sons who were hostile to Christianity and drove the missionaries out , encouraging their subjects to return to their native paganism . Christianity only hung on with R\u00e6dwald , who was still worshiping the pagan gods alongside Christ . </P> <P> The first Archbishops of Canterbury during the first half of the 7th century were members of the original Gregorian mission . The first native Saxon to be consecrated archbishop was Deusdedit of Canterbury , enthroned in 655 . The first native Anglo - Saxon bishop was Ithamar , enthroned as Bishop of Rochester in 644 . </P> <P> The decisive shift to Christianity occurred in 655 when King Penda was slain in the Battle of the Winwaed and Mercia became officially Christian for the first time . The death of Penda also allowed Cenwalh of Wessex to return from exile and return Wessex , another powerful kingdom , to Christianity . After 655 , only Sussex and the Isle of Wight remained openly pagan , although Wessex and Essex would later crown pagan kings . In 686 Arwald , the last openly pagan king was slain in battle and from this point on all Anglo - Saxon kings were at least nominally Christian ( although there is some confusion about the religion of Caedwalla who ruled Wessex until 688 ) . </P> <P> Lingering paganism among the common population gradually became English folklore . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Kent 588 - 640 <Ul> <Li> 1.1 588 : \u00c6thelbert of Kent marries Bertha </Li> <Li> 1.2 597 : Gregorian mission arrives </Li> <Li> 1.3 616 : Eadbald 's Pagan backlash <Ul> <Li> 1.3. 1 Bede 's account </Li> <Li> 1.3. 2 Alternative chronology </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 1.4 640 : Eorcenberht orders idols destroyed </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 Essex 604 - 665 </Li> <Li> 3 East Anglia 604 - 630 <Ul> <Li> 3.1 604 : R\u00e6dwald is baptized </Li> <Li> 3.2 627 : Eorpwald is baptized </Li> <Li> 3.3 627 : Ricberht 's Pagan backlash </Li> <Li> 3.4 630 : Sigeberht of East Anglia returns from exile </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Northumbria 625 - 634 </Li> <Li> 5 Mercia 653 - 655 </Li> <Li> 6 Sussex 675 - 681 </Li> <Li> 7 Wessex 603 - 685 </Li> <Li> 8 Isle of Wight 661 - 686 </Li> <Li> 9 Notes </Li> <Li> 10 References </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Kent 588 - 640 ( edit ) </H2> <H3> 588 : \u00c6thelbert of Kent marries Bertha ( edit ) </H3> Gregory dictating , from a 10th - century manuscript <P> In 595 , when Pope Gregory I decided to send a mission to convert the Anglo - Saxons to Christianity , the Kingdom of Kent was ruled by \u00c6thelberht . He had married a Christian princess named Bertha before 588 , and perhaps earlier than 560 . Bertha was the daughter of Charibert I , one of the Merovingian kings of the Franks . As one of the conditions of her marriage she had brought a bishop named Liudhard with her to Kent as her chaplain . They restored a church in Canterbury that dated to Roman times , possibly the present - day St Martin 's Church . \u00c6thelberht was at that time a pagan , but he allowed his wife freedom of worship . Liudhard does not appear to have made many converts among the Anglo - Saxons , and if not for the discovery of a gold coin bearing the inscription Leudardus Eps ( Eps is an abbreviation of Episcopus , the Latin word for bishop ) his existence may have been doubted . One of Bertha 's biographers states that , influenced by his wife , \u00c6thelberht requested Pope Gregory to send missionaries . The historian Ian Wood feels that the initiative came from the Kentish court as well as the queen . </P> <H3> 597 : Gregorian mission arrives ( edit ) </H3> <P> In 597 the mission landed in Kent , and it quickly achieved some initial success : \u00c6thelberht permitted the missionaries to settle and preach in his capital of Canterbury , where they used the church of St. Martin 's for services , and this church became the seat of the bishopric . Neither Bede nor Gregory mentions the date of \u00c6thelberht 's conversion , but it probably took place in 597 . </P> <P> In the early medieval period , large - scale conversions required the ruler 's conversion first , and large numbers of converts are recorded within a year of the mission 's arrival in Kent . By 601 , Gregory was writing to both \u00c6thelberht and Bertha , calling the king his son and referring to his baptism . A late medieval tradition , recorded by the 15th - century chronicler Thomas Elmham , gives the date of the king 's conversion as Whit Sunday , or 2 June 597 ; there is no reason to doubt this date , but there is no other evidence for it . A letter of Gregory 's to Patriarch Eulogius of Alexandria in June 598 mentions the number of converts made , but does not mention any baptism of the king in 597 , although it is clear that by 601 he had been converted . The royal baptism probably took place at Canterbury , but Bede does not mention the location . </P> <P> Why \u00c6thelberht chose to convert to Christianity is uncertain . Bede suggests that the king converted strictly for religious reasons , but most modern historians see other motives behind \u00c6thelberht 's decision . Certainly , given Kent 's close contacts with Gaul , it is possible that \u00c6thelberht sought baptism in order to smooth his relations with the Merovingian kingdoms , or to align himself with one of the factions then contending in Gaul . Another consideration may have been that new methods of administration often followed conversion , whether directly from the newly introduced church or indirectly from other Christian kingdoms . </P> <P> Evidence from Bede suggests that although \u00c6thelberht encouraged conversion , he was unable to compel his subjects to become Christians . The historian R.A. Markus feels that this was due to a strong pagan presence in the kingdom , which forced the king to rely on indirect means including royal patronage and friendship to secure conversions . For Markus , this is demonstrated by the way in which Bede describes the king 's conversion efforts , which when a subject converted , were to `` rejoice at their conversion '' and to `` hold believers in greater affection '' . </P> <H3> 616 : Eadbald 's pagan backlash ( edit ) </H3> <Table> <Tr> <Td_colspan=\"2\"> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> O : Bust of Eadbald right .

Although \u00c6thelberht had been Christian since about 600 and his wife Bertha was also Christian , Eadbald was a pagan . Bertha died some time before Eadbald 's accession , and \u00c6thelberht remarried . The name of \u00c6thelberht 's second wife is not recorded , but it seems likely that she was a pagan , since on his death she married Eadbald , her stepson : a marriage between a stepmother and stepson was forbidden by the church . </P> <P> Bede records that Eadbald 's repudiation of Christianity was a `` severe setback '' to the growth of the church . S\u00e6berht , the king of Essex , had become a Christian under \u00c6thelberht 's influence , but on S\u00e6berht 's death , at about the same time , his sons expelled Mellitus , the bishop of London . According to Bede , Eadbald was punished for his faithlessness by `` frequent fits of insanity '' , and possession by an `` evil spirit '' ( perhaps referring to epileptic fits ) , but was eventually persuaded to give up his wife and adopt Christianity . Eadbald 's second wife , Ymme , was Frankish , and it may well be that Kent 's strong connections with Francia were a factor in Eadbald 's conversion . It is likely that the missionaries in Canterbury had Frankish support . In the 620s , Eadbald 's sister \u00c6thelburg came to Kent , but sent her children to the court of King Dagobert I in Francia ; in addition to the diplomatic connections , trade with the Franks was important to Kent . It is thought likely that Frankish pressure had been influential in persuading \u00c6thelberht to become Christian , and Eadbald 's conversion and marriage to Ymme are likely to have been closely connected diplomatic decisions . </P> <P> Two graves from a well - preserved sixth and seventh - century Anglo - Saxon cemetery at Finglesham have yielded a bronze pendant and a gilt buckle with designs that are related to each other and may be symbolic of religious activity involving the Germanic deity Woden . These objects probably date from the period of the pagan reaction . </P> Bede 's account ( edit ) <P> Bede 's account of Eadbald 's rejection of the church and subsequent conversion is quite detailed , but not without some internal inconsistencies . Bede 's version of events are laid out as follows : </P> <Ul> <Li> 24 February 616 : \u00c6thelberht dies and Eadbald succeeds . </Li> <Li> 616 : Eadbald leads a pagan reaction to Christianity . He marries his stepmother , contrary to church law , and he refuses baptism . At about this time Mellitus , bishop of London , is expelled by the sons of S\u00e6berht in Essex , and goes to Kent . </Li> <Li> 616 : Mellitus and Justus , bishop of Rochester , leave Kent for Francia . </Li> <Li> 616 / 617 : Some time after Mellitus and Justus depart , Laurence , the archbishop of Canterbury , plans to leave for Francia , but has a vision in which St Peter scourges him . In the morning he shows the scars to Eadbald who is converted to Christianity as a result . </Li> <Li> 617 : Justus and Mellitus both return from Francia , `` the year after they left '' . Justus is restored to Rochester . </Li> <Li> c. 619 : Laurence dies , and Mellitus becomes archbishop of Canterbury . </Li> <Li> 619 -- 624 : Eadbald builds a church which is consecrated by Archbishop Mellitus . </Li> <Li> 24 April 624 : Mellitus dies and Justus succeeds him as archbishop of Canterbury . </Li> <Li> 624 : after Justus 's succession , Pope Boniface writes to him to say that he has heard in letters from King Aduluald ( possibly a scribal error for Eadbald ) of the king 's conversion to Christianity . Boniface sends the pallium with this letter , adding that it is only to be worn when celebrating `` the Holy Mysteries '' . </Li> <Li> By 625 Edwin of Deira , king of Northumbria , asks for the hand in marriage of \u00c6thelburg , Eadbald 's sister . Edwin is told he must allow her to practice Christianity , and must consider baptism himself . </Li> <Li> 21 July 625 : Justus consecrates Paulinus bishop of York . </Li> <Li> July or later in 625 : Edwin agrees to the terms and \u00c6thelburg travels to Northumbria , accompanied by Paulinus . </Li> <Li> Easter 626 : \u00c6thelburg is delivered of a daughter , Eanfl\u00e6d . </Li> <Li> 626 : Edwin completes a military campaign against the West Saxons . At `` about this time '' Boniface writes to both Edwin and \u00c6thelburg . The letter to Edwin urges him to accept Christianity and refers to the conversion of Eadbald . The letter to \u00c6thelburg mentions that the pope has recently heard the news of Eadbald 's conversion , and encourages her to work for the conversion of her husband , Edwin . </Li> </Ul> Alternative chronology ( edit ) <P> Although Bede 's narrative is widely accepted , an alternative chronology has been proposed by D.P. Kirby . Kirby points out that Boniface 's letter to \u00c6thelburg makes it clear that the news of Eadbald 's conversion is recent , and that it is unthinkable that Boniface would not have been kept up to date on the status of Eadbald 's conversion . Hence Eadbald must have been converted by Justus , as is implied by Boniface 's letter to Justus . The pallium accompanying that letter indicates Justus was archbishop by that time , and the duration of Mellitus 's archiepiscopate means that even if Bede 's dates are somewhat wrong in other particulars , Eadbald was converted no earlier than 621 , and no later than April 624 , since Mellitus consecrated a church for Eadbald before his death in that month . The account of Laurence 's miraculous scourging by Peter can be disregarded as a later hagiographical invention of the monastery of St Augustine 's , Canterbury . </P> <P> As mentioned above , it has been suggested that King `` Aduluald '' in the letter to Justus is a real king \u00c6thelwald , perhaps a junior king of west Kent . In that case it would appear that Laurence converted Eadbald , and Justus converted \u00c6thelwald . It has also been suggested that the pallium did not indicate Justus was archbishop , since Justus is told the limited circumstances in which he may wear it ; however , the same phrasing occurs in the letter conveying the pallium to Archbishop Augustine , also quoted in Bede . Another possibility is that the letter was originally two letters . In this view , Bede has conflated the letter conveying the pallium with the letter congratulating Justus on the conversion , which according to Bede 's account was seven or so years earlier ; but the grammatical details on which this suggestion is based are not unique to this letter , and as a result it is usually considered to be a single composition . </P> <P> The letter to \u00c6thelburg makes it clear that she was already married at the time the news of Eadbald 's conversion reached Rome . This is quite inconsistent with the earlier date Bede gives for Eadbald 's acceptance of Christianity , and it has been suggested in Bede 's defence that \u00c6thelburg married Edwin substantially earlier and stayed in Kent until 625 before travelling to Rome , and that the letter was written while she was in Kent . However , it would appear from Boniface 's letter that Boniface thought of \u00c6thelburg as being at her husband 's side . It also appears that the letter to Justus was written after the letters to Edwin and \u00c6thelburg , rather than before , as Bede has it ; Boniface 's letter to Edwin and \u00c6thelburg indicates he had the news from messengers , but when he wrote to Justus he had heard from the king himself . </P> <P> The story of \u00c6thelburg 's marriage being dependent on Edwin allowing her to practice her faith has been questioned , since revising the chronology makes it likely , though not certain , that the marriage was arranged before Eadbald 's conversion . In this view , it would have been the church that objected to the marriage , and \u00c6thelburg would have been Christian before Eadbald 's conversion . The story of Paulinus 's consecration is also problematic as he was not consecrated until at least 625 and possibly later , which is after the latest possible date for \u00c6thelburg 's marriage . However , it may be that he traveled to Northumbria prior to his consecration and only later became bishop . </P> <P> A revised chronology of some of these events follows , taking the above considerations into account . </P> <Ul> <Li> 616 : Eadbald leads a pagan reaction to Christianity . </Li> <Li> 616 : Mellitus and Justus , bishop of Rochester , leave Kent for Francia . </Li> <Li> c. 619 : Laurence dies , and Mellitus becomes archbishop of Canterbury . </Li> <Li> Early 624 ? : Justus converts Eadbald . Messengers go to Rome . Also at about this time \u00c6thelburg 's marriage to Edwin is arranged , perhaps before the conversion . Eadbald builds a church , and Mellitus consecrates it . </Li> <Li> 24 April 624 : Mellitus dies and Justus succeeds him as archbishop of Canterbury . </Li> <Li> Mid 624 : Edwin agrees to the marriage terms and \u00c6thelburg travels to Northumbria , accompanied by Paulinus . </Li> <Li> Later 624 : the pope receives news of Eadbald 's conversion and writes to \u00c6thelburg and Edwin . </Li> <Li> Still later 624 : the pope hears from Eadbald of his conversion , and also hears of Mellitus 's death . He writes to Justus to send him the pallium . </Li> <Li> 21 July 625 or 626 : Justus consecrates Paulinus bishop of York . </Li> </Ul> <P> This timeline extends the duration of the pagan reaction from less than a year , in Bede 's narrative , to about eight years . This represents a more serious setback for the church . </P> <H3> 640 : Eorcenberht orders idols destroyed ( edit ) </H3> <P> According to Bede ( HE III. 8 ) , Eorcenberht was the first king in Britain to command that pagan `` idols '' ( cult images ) be destroyed and that Lent be observed . It has been suggested that these orders may have been officially committed to writing , in the tradition of Kentish law - codes initiated by \u00c6thelberht , but no such text survives . This indicates that while King Eadbald had converted at least 16 years previously , the general population were still openly pagan in 640 . </P> <H2> Essex 604 - 665 ( edit ) </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> This section does not cite any sources .

Mellitus returned to Essex when Eadbald of Kent converted , but pagans drove him out again . Essex remained officially pagan until 653 when Oswy of Northumbria persuaded Sigeberht the Good to convert and allow Cedd to preach there . In 660 Sigeberht was killed by his pagan brothers for being too accommodating to Christianity . Swithhelm took over , but \u00c6thelwold of East Anglia persuaded him to convert in 662 . Swithhelm died in 664 and his two cousins Sighere and S\u00e6bbi ruled Essex jointly . While there is no mention of Sighere accepting Christianity in the first place , when a plague broke out in 665 he `` abandoned the mysteries of the Christian faith and relapsed into paganism '' . The people in Sighere 's half of Essex became openly pagan once again , but S\u00e6bbi 's ally Wulfhere of Merica sent the Jaruman to convert them and made Sighere marry his niece Osyth , who he later divorced . Sighere was the last pagan king of Essex . </P> <H2> East Anglia 604 - 630 ( edit ) </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> This section does not cite any sources .

( December 2016 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) </Td> </Tr> </Table> <H3> 604 : R\u00e6dwald is baptized ( edit ) </H3> <P> R\u00e6dwald of East Anglia received the Christian sacraments from Mellitus in Kent , presumably at the invitation of \u00c6thelberht who may have been his baptismal sponsor . The date of this initiation is not exactly known , but since it is claimed that Augustine ( d. c 604 ) dedicated a church near Ely , it may have followed Saebert 's conversion fairly swiftly . In this way R\u00e6dwald became aligned with \u00c6thelberht 's system of authority . Bede states that even during \u00c6thelbert 's lifetime R\u00e6dwald was building up the leadership of the southern English for his own nation of East Angles . </P> <P> In East Anglia R\u00e6dwald 's conversion was not universally acceptable to his household , nor by his wife . She and her pagan teachers probably persuaded him to default in part from his commitment to it . In his temple , therefore , there were two altars , one dedicated to Christ , and one for dedications to the Anglo - Saxon gods . Raedwald is considered the most likely candidate for the Sutton Hoo ship burial , which displays both pagan and Christian iconography . </P> <P> In 616 the pagan backlash in Kent and Essex left R\u00e6dwald the only ( partially ) Christian king in the Anglo - Saxon kingdoms . R\u00e6dwald died in 624 and was succeeded by his son Eorpwald . </P> <H3> 627 : Eorpwald is baptized ( edit ) </H3> <P> Paulinus undertook the conversion of the Northumbrian people , and also those of the Kingdom of Lindsey ( Lincolnshire ) and East Anglia . This Christian patronage helped to affirm Edwin 's position as senior ruler of the English , and until his final confrontation with Cadwallon ap Cadfan of Gwynedd in 632 - 3 he also held the British or Welsh powers under his dominion . </P> <P> It was at Edwin 's prompting that Eorpwald , together with his kingdom , received the Christian faith and sacraments . Eorpwald was therefore not yet a Christian during his father 's lifetime nor at his own accession . It is not known whether his baptism took place in East Anglia , Northumbria or Kent , but it is very likely that Edwin , now a senior ruler , was his sponsor at baptism . The conversion had the political benefit of bringing the entire eastern seaboard from Northumbria to Kent under the dominion of Christian rulers in alliance with Edwin , with the single exception of the Essex . </P> <H3> 627 : Ricberht 's pagan backlash ( edit ) </H3> <P> Not long after his conversion Eorpwald was slain ( occisus ) by a pagan ( viro gentili ) named Ricberht . The circumstances are not recorded , so that it is not known whether Ricberht represented an internal East Anglian opposition to Christian rule , or if he was an emissary from an external power wishing to diminish Edwin 's influence . </P> <P> Bede states that after the slaying of Eorpwald the kingdom reverted to heathen rule ( in errore versata est ) for three years . This does not necessarily mean an overt struggle between the worship of the Anglo - Saxon gods and the worship of Christ , but could equally express a conflict in the political allegiances which Edwin 's rise to power had prompted . The attribution of these three years to a supposed rule of Ricberht is a banner of convenience , though the fact that his name was remembered at all ( when East Anglian history of this period is dependent upon very fragmentary records ) indicates that he was a person of some importance . </P> <H3> 630 : Sigeberht of East Anglia returns from exile ( edit ) </H3> <P> After the interregnum prompted by Eorpwald 's assassination , Sigeberht was recalled from Gaul to become ruler of the East Angles . It is likely that he gained the kingdom by military means , because his prowess as a military commander was later remembered . During his reign part of the Kingdom was governed by his kinsman Ecgric , the relationship described by the Latin term cognatus . This may mean that Ecgric was a son of R\u00e6dwald . However some authorities consider Ecgric to be the same person as \u00c6thilric , named in the East Anglian tally ( in the Anglian Collection ) as a son of Eni , R\u00e6dwald 's brother . Whoever Ecgric was , Sigeberht had equal or senior power while he ruled , because the influence of his religious patronage was felt both in eastern and western parts of the kingdom . </P> <P> Sigeberht 's Christian conversion may have been a decisive factor in his achieving royal power , since at that time Edwin of Northumbria ( 616 - 632 / 3 ) was the senior English king , and only he and Eadbald of Kent were Christian rulers . Eadbald certainly had contacts with the Frankish rulers . After Dagobert succeeded Clothar II in Francia in 628 , Sigeberht 's emergence helped to strengthen the English conversion upon which Edwin 's power rested . Sigeberht is likely to have encouraged the conversion of Ecgric , if he was not already Christian . Edwin 's encouragement took shape in the marriage of his grand - niece Hereswith , sister of Saint Hilda , to \u00c6thilric , R\u00e6dwald 's nephew . Hereswith and Hild were under Edwin 's protection and were baptised with him in 626 . This marriage held the presumption that \u00c6thilric was , or would become , Christian , and probably also that he should at some time become King of East Anglia . </P> <P> Bede relates that the East Anglian apostle Saint Felix came to England from Burgundy as a missionary bishop , and was sent by Honorius , the Archbishop of Canterbury to assist Sigeberht . William of Malmesbury has the later story that Felix accompanied Sigeberht to East Anglia . In either case , this dates Sigeberht 's accession to c629 - 630 , because Felix was Bishop for 17 years , his successor Thomas for five , and his successor Berhtgisl Boniface for 17 - and Berhtgisl died in around 669 . Sigeberht established the bishop 's seat of his kingdom for Felix at Dommoc , claimed variously for Dunwich or Walton , Felixstowe ( both coastal sites in Suffolk ) . If at Walton ( as Rochester claimed during the thirteenth century ) , the site of Dommoc may have been within the precinct of a Roman fort which formerly stood there . </P> <P> Sigeberht also established a school in his kingdom for boys to be taught reading and writing in Latin , on the model that he had witnessed in Gaul . Felix assisted him by obtaining teachers of the kind who taught in Kent . Paulinus of York was from 633 to 644 bishop of Rochester on the Medway , then the nearest bishopric in Kent to East Anglia . Paulinus had ( according to the Whitby Life of Gregory the Great ) been connected with the court of R\u00e6dwald during the exile of Edwin . </P> <P> The allegiance of Felix to Canterbury determined the Roman basis of the East Anglian Church , though his training in Burgundy may have been coloured by the teaching of the Irish missionary Columbanus in Luxeuil . In around 633 , perhaps shortly before Aidan was sent to Lindisfarne from Iona , the Irish royal hermit and missionary Fursey came from the Athlone area with his priests and brethren to East Anglia . Sigeberht granted him a monastery site in an old Roman fort called Cnobheresburg , usually identified as Burgh Castle near Yarmouth . Felix and Fursey both effected many conversions and established churches in Sigeberht 's kingdom . Bede records that Archbishop Honorius and Bishop Felix much admired the work of Aidan of Lindisfarne . Therefore , it is likely that they also appreciated of Fursey , whose community also lived according to the ascetic principles of Irish Christianity . </P> <H2> Northumbria 625 - 634 ( edit ) </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> This section does not cite any sources .

In 681 Wilfrid arrived in Sussex to begin converting the general population . Bede says Wulfhere had had him converted `` not long previously '' , but it could n't have been later than 675 because that is when Wulfhere died . \u00c6thelwealh gave Wilfrid land in Selsey where he founded Selsey Abbey . While there Wilfrid met with C\u00e6dwalla of Wessex and guaranteed support for his invasion of Sussex ( despite \u00c6thelwealh granting him land and allowing him to preach in his kingdom ) . In 685 C\u00e6dwalla , who was now King of Wessex , invaded Sussex and killed \u00c6thelwealh . Two ealdormen of \u00c6thelwealh , Berthun and Andhun , drove him out and administered the kingdom from then on . Their religious affiliation is not recorded . In 686 Wilfrid was recalled to York , Berthun and Andhun attacked Kent , Berthun was killed somewhere along the line and Sussex was conquered by C\u00e6dwalla . </P> <H2> Wessex 603 - 685 ( edit ) </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> This section needs additional citations for verification .

In the village of Cernel the locals jeered at him and drove him out of town , pinning fish to him in mockery of his religion . According to this legend Augustine eventually returned and converted them by smashing their idol . Bede , however , says that the West Saxons were `` completely heathen '' until 635 when Birinus began preaching there . The joint Kings Cynigils and Cwichelm were baptised in 635 or 636 with King Oswin of Northumbria as their godfather , and Bede claims the common population were converted also . When Cynegils died in 643 his son Cenwalh ascended to the throne ; Bede said of Cenwalh , that he `` refused to embrace the mysteries of the faith , and of the heavenly kingdom ; and not long after also he lost the dominion of his earthly kingdom ; for he put away the sister of Penda , king of the Mercians , whom he had married , and took another wife ; whereupon a war ensuing , he was by him expelled his kingdom '' . The pagan King Penda took over Wessex and Cenwalh accepted baptism while under the protection of the Christian king Anna of East Anglia . Penda was killed in 655 allowing the now - Christian Cenwalh to return to Wessex . He was succeeded by his widow Seaxburh and then \u00c6scwine ; their religion is unknown . In 676 Centwine took the throne . Centwine was a Heathen throughout his reign , but abdicated to become a Christian monk . C\u00e6dwalla became king of Wessex in 685 or 686 , and his religion is difficult to determine . He remained unbaptised throughout his entire reign , but supported Christianity . Before attacking the pagan Isle of Wight , be vowed to give 1 / 4 of the land and booty to the Church if he was successful , a vow he fulfilled by granting estates to Wilfrid . He also `` allowed '' the heirs of Arwald , the last pagan King of Wight , to be baptised before he executed them . He is recorded elsewhere granting land to the church . Before conquering Sussex he worked with the Bishops Wilfrid and Eorcenwald to establish an ecclesiastical structure there . He was seriously wounded while conquering the Isle of Wight in 686 . In 688 he abdicated and went on a pilgrimage to Rome and was baptised by Pope Sergius I on 10 April 689 , dying 10 days later from his wounds . </P> <P> His successor Ine issued a law code in 695 which reveal him to be a Christian . However , one of Ine 's laws proscribe a fine for failing to baptise one 's children , and another fine for failing to tithe , which indicates the common population were slow to adopt Christian habits voluntarily . </P> <H2> Isle of Wight 661 - 686 ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> 661 : Wulfhere of Mercia invades , islanders forcibly baptized </Li> <Li> 661 : Wulfhere of Mercia leaves , islanders immediately return to Heathenism </Li> <Li> 686 : C\u00e6dwalla of Wessex invades , islanders ethnically cleansed and Kingdom annexed </Li> </Ul> <P> The Jutes of the Isle of Wight were forcibly baptised when Wulfhere invaded in 661 . When Wulfhere returned to Mercia he left the priest Eoppa in Wight , but he could not stop the islanders quickly reverting to open paganism . Wight remained pagan until 686 when it was invaded by the Christian sympathiser C\u00e6dwalla of Wessex . Their pagan King Arwald was killed in battle , and his heirs were baptised and executed . Most of the pagan population was purportedly exterminated and replaced with Christian West Saxons . Those who remained were forced to accept baptism and also the West Saxon dialect , and the Isle of Wight was incorporated into the Kingdom of Wessex . King Arwald was the last English King to die a pagan . </P> <H2> Notes ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ Bede 's chronology may be a little awry , as he gives the king 's death as occurring in February 616 , and says the king died 21 years after his conversion , which would date the conversion to 595 . This would be before the mission and would mean that either the queen or Liudhard converted \u00c6thelberht , which contradicts Bede 's own statement that the king 's conversion was due to the Gregorian mission . Since Gregory in his letter of 601 to the king and queen strongly implies that the queen was unable to effect the conversion of her husband , thus providing independent testimony to \u00c6thelberht 's conversion by the mission , the problem of the dating is likely a chronological error on Bede 's part . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ The letter , as translated in Brooks ' Early History of the Church of Canterbury , p. 8 , says `` preserve the grace he had received '' . Grace in this context meant the grace of baptism . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Attempts by Suso Brechter to argue that \u00c6thelberht was not converted until after 601 have met with little agreement among medievalists . </Li> </Ol> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ Stenton Anglo - Saxon England pp. 104 -- 105 </Li> <Li> ^ Jump up to : Stenton Anglo - Saxon England pp. 105 -- 106 </Li> <Li> ^ Jump up to : Kirby Earliest English Kings pp. 24 -- 25 </Li> <Li> ^ Jump up to : Nelson `` Bertha ( b.c. 565 , d. in or after 601 ) '' Oxford Dictionary of National Biography </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Hindley Brief History of the Anglo - Saxons pp. 33 -- 36 </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Herrin Formation of Christendom p. 169 </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Higham Convert Kings p. 73 </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Wood `` Mission of Augustine of Canterbury '' Speculum pp. 9 -- 10 </Li> <Li> ^ Jump up to : Mayr - Harting `` Augustine ( St Augustine ) ( d . 604 ) '' Oxford Dictionary of National Biography </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Fletcher The Barbarian Conversion pp. 116 -- 117 </Li> <Li> ^ Jump up to : Brooks Early History of the Church of Canterbury pp. 8 -- 9 </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Wood `` Mission of Augustine of Canterbury '' Speculum p. 11 </Li> <Li> ^ Jump up to : Kirby Earliest English Kings p. 28 </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Markus `` Chronology of the Gregorian Mission '' Journal of Ecclesiastical History p. 16 </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Higham Convert Kings p. 56 </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Higham Convert Kings p. 53 </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Higham Convert Kings pp. 90 -- 102 </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Campbell `` Observations '' Essays in Anglo - Saxon History p. 76 </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Markus Gregory the Great and His World pp. 182 -- 183 </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Quoted in Markus Gregory the Great and His World p. 183 </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Kirby , Earliest English Kings , pp. 31 -- 33 , provides an extended discussion of the chronology of \u00c6thelberht 's reign . </Li> <Li> ^ Jump up to : Bede , Ecclesiastical History , bk.
