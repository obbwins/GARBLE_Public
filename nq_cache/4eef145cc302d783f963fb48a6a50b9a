When making the announcement at the press release , Vollack commented that there were `` few groups out there '' that could match the `` incredibly fun feel '' and the `` animated vision '' that Genndy Tartakovsky brought to the movie and stated that Fifth Harmony `` knocked it out of the park . '' According to Vollack , the track was exactly what `` we were hoping for . '' A preview of `` I 'm in Love with a Monster '' was featured in a trailer for the movie which was released on June 17 , 2015 . The song was released for digital download on August 14 . and serviced to contemporary hit radio four days later on August 18 . </P> <P> `` I 'm in Love with a Monster '' was written by Harmony Samuels , Carmen Reece , Sarah Mancuso , Edgar Etienne and Ericka Coulter .

See media help . </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> `` I 'm in Love with a Monster '' is a funk - influenced pop song performed in a moderately fast tempo . According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Sony Music Publishing , `` I 'm in Love with a Monster '' written in the key of C# minor and is set in a 4 4 time signature . The song has been viewed as reminiscent of 1960s music , with Jeff Benjamin of Fuse describing the tune as a `` throwback - inspired funk jam - thumper '' . The song utilizes `` deep heavy beats , trombones and drums over an almost creepy base . '' The lyrics of `` I 'm in Love with a Monster '' revolve around a person who is in love with a mischievous person , using `` monster '' as a hyperbole to describe its personality . Carolyn Menyes from website `` Music Times '' commented that the song `` takes on loving an unconventional type of guy , who is , well , a monster . He 's the type who will but you thorns and leather before roses and lace . '' </P> <H2> Critical reception ( edit ) </H2> Critics drew comparisons to 1960 's all - female group The Supremes . <P> `` I 'm in Love with a Monster '' received mostly positive responses , with several critics noting a similarity between the musical style of 1960 's all - female group The Supremes . Robbie Daw , from Idolator pointed out the resemblance to 1960s girl groups , such as the Supremes , and said , `` Fifth Harmony 's vocal ability shine brightly . '' In a positive review , Joseph Earp of Renowned for Sound said that the song is a `` testament '' to the group 's `` myriad of skills '' in which it does not feel like a `` movie cash in '' . He elaborates by stating that this was `` as rich and deep '' as anything the group has ever released . Earp gave the song a four and a half out of five stars rating . </P> <P> Writing for Fuse , Jeff Benjamin compared the `` booming tuba '' to the 1960s track , `` Big Spender '' and called the chorus `` slick '' and `` repetitive '' . Phillip Picardi of Teen Vogue wrote that the song is `` catchy and upbeat , with a nod to the ' 60s '' , from a cross between early Pussycat Dolls and The Supremes `` . Picardi finishes his review by stating that despite the group 's previous songs like `` Boss '' and `` Worth It '' , which hold momentum , this song is `` still gold . '' Conversely , Chris DeVille of Stereogum was critical of the song saying that it was a `` dumb soundtrack song ( sic ) for kids movies '' and stated that the track did not compare with the singles from Reflection . </P> <H2> Music video ( edit ) </H2> <P> The music video debuted on New York City 's Time Square Plaza on August 27 , 2015 . It later premiered on Vevo the same day . Members of the girl group each reprise the role of a different character , but a `` fun , gothic style '' and Halloween - themed decor is common throughout the video . In an exclusive behind the scenes interview with Entertainment Tonight , the group revealed that Camila played Margaret , Lauren played Scarlett , Dinah played Cathy , Normani played Suga and Ally played Mary Jane . Scenes from Hotel Transylvania 2 are spliced with scenes of Fifth Harmony exploring a haunted hotel accompanied by a variety of monsters . </P> <H3> Synopsis and reception ( edit ) </H3> The members of Fifth Harmony dressed in 1940s style attire , dancing in front of a hotel in reminisence of a Halloween theme . <P> The video begins with a static television screen showing the group 's name before interchanging clips from the Hotel Transylvania 2 movie and individual takes of the girls inside a hotel . The setting is Halloween themed with skulls , candles and dim lighting through out the area . All girls then stand in front of a hotel , with different colored suitcases and each wearing coats while dancing . Lauren then sings as she holds a rotary dial telephone in her hand . The scene intensifies as rapid shots of the girls appear on screen . Synchronized choreography is performed by all the girls , in front of the hotel . Interchanged scenes consist of movie clips and Normani and Dinah behaving in a seductive way as the monsters make their way towards the halls . </P> <P> Each group then stands in a hallway , singing and moving to a camera before walking as Lauren holds a candle lantern in her hand as an ominous purple light beams in the background before turning blue . All of them are seen wearing large sunglasses . In different takes , the group dances mimicking a zombie . The monsters then make their way to the rooms , where some initially attempt to fight them but eventually interact with them , by taking pictures , dancing and seducing them . Towards the end of the video , one of the monsters snaps his finger , putting Ally to sleep . The girls begin to act more aggressive , laughing maniacally , with the video zooming out to the show the initial static screen . Zach Dionne of Fuse described the styling of Fifth Harmony 's costumes as `` Stepford Wives - gone - Addams Family '' and also commented that the video was reminiscent of the TRL era when many music videos often included scenes from movies . </P> <H2> Track listing ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Digital download </Li> </Ul> <Table> <Tr> <Th> No . </Th> <Th> Title </Th> <Th> Length </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1 . </Td> <Td> `` I 'm in Love with a Monster '' </Td> <Td> 3 : 31 </Td> </Tr> </Table> <H2> Charts ( edit ) </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Chart ( 2015 ) </Th> <Th> Peak position </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Belgium ( Ultratip Flanders ) </Th> <Td> 23 </Td> </Tr> </Table> <H2> Release history ( edit ) </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Country </Th> <Th> Date </Th> <Th> Format </Th> <Th> Label </Th> <Th> Ref </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> United States </Td> <Td> August 14 , 2015 ( 2015 - 08 - 14 ) </Td> <Td> Digital download </Td> <Td> Syco </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> August 18 , 2015 ( 2015 - 08 - 18 ) </Td> <Td> Contemporary hit radio </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> </Table> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> ^ Jump up to : Sony Pictures Animation ( 16 June 2015 ) . `` Pop Sensation Fifth Harmony Checks In To ' Hotel Transylvania 2 ' With Their New Song `` I 'm In Love With A Monster '' `` . prnewswire.com .
