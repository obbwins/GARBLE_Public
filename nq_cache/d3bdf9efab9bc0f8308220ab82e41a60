The song was released on March 29 , 2005 , through Island Records , as the second single from the album . `` We Belong Together '' was written by Carey , Jermaine Dupri , Manuel Seal , and Johnt\u00e1 Austin , and produced by the former three . As the song samples lyrics from Bobby Womack 's `` If You Think You 're Lonely Now '' ( 1981 ) and the Deele 's `` Two Occasions '' ( 1987 ) , several other songwriters are credited . `` We Belong Together '' is built on a simple piano arrangement with an understated backbeat . The lyrics chronicle a woman 's desperation for her former lover to return . </P> <P> Following her decline in popularity between 2001 and 2005 , critics dubbed the song her musical comeback , as many had considered her career over . `` We Belong Together '' earned her several music industry awards and nominations throughout 2005 -- 06 . The song broke chart records in the United States and became Carey 's sixteenth topper on the US Billboard Hot 100 . After staying at number one for fourteen non-consecutive weeks , it joined four other songs in a tie as the second longest running number one song in US chart history , behind Carey 's own 1995 collaboration with Boyz II Men titled `` One Sweet Day '' . Billboard listed it as the `` song of the decade '' and the eleventh most popular song of all time . Additionally , it broke several airplay records , gathering both the largest one - day and one - week audiences in history . `` We Belong Together '' also topped the charts in Australia and reached the top five in Denmark , Hungary , Ireland , the Netherlands , New Zealand , Scotland , Spain , and the United Kingdom . </P> <P> The song 's music video was filmed as a two - part story with `` It 's Like That '' , which featured Carey at her bachelorette party . The video for `` We Belong Together '' is a continuation focusing on Carey 's wedding to an older and powerful man and ends with the singer eloping with her ex-lover . Rumors arose of the video 's connection to her 1993 marriage to Tommy Mottola . Carey performed the song on several award shows and television appearances around the world , namely MTV Movie Awards , MTV Video Music Awards , Macy 's Fourth of July Parade , The Oprah Winfrey Show and the 48th Grammy Awards . In Europe the song was performed at the Live 8 charity concert , the Fashion Rocks in Monaco , and the German Bambi Awards . Carey performed the song on both her Adventures of Mimi and Angels Advocate Tours . </P> <H2> Contents </H2> <Ul> <Li> 1 Background </Li> <Li> 2 Music and structure </Li> <Li> 3 Critical reception </Li> <Li> 4 Chart performance </Li> <Li> 5 Awards and nominations </Li> <Li> 6 Remixes </Li> <Li> 7 Music video <Ul> <Li> 7.1 Background </Li> <Li> 7.2 Synopsis </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 8 Live performances </Li> <Li> 9 Formats and track listings </Li> <Li> 10 Credits and personnel </Li> <Li> 11 Charts <Ul> <Li> 11.1 Weekly charts </Li> <Li> 11.2 Year - end charts </Li> <Li> 11.3 Decade - end charts </Li> <Li> 11.4 All - time charts </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 12 Certifications </Li> <Li> 13 See also </Li> <Li> 14 References </Li> <Li> 15 External links </Li> </Ul> <H2> Background ( edit ) </H2> <P> Carey had produced back - to - back commercially and critically unsuccessful albums , Glitter ( 2001 ) and Charmbracelet ( 2002 ) . Though fueled by strong media attention regarding Carey 's return to music , as well as her new deal with Island Records , the albums failed to deliver the type of success she had been accustomed to throughout the 1990s , and only managed sales of 3 million copies globally . After the album 's release , and its succeeding tour , Carey began conceptualizing and working on a new project , eventually titled The Emancipation of Mimi , her tenth studio effort . `` We Belong Together '' became a song that critics considered Carey 's `` return to form '' and `` the return of The Voice '' , after several questioned her vocal abilities following the release of Charmbracelet . </P> <P> By November 2004 , Carey had already recorded several songs for The Emancipation of Mimi . Island Records chairman L.A. Reid suggested Carey that she compose a few more strong singles to ensure the project 's commercial success . Noting that she had written some of her best work with Jermaine Dupri , Reid recommended her to meet with Dupri for a brief studio session . Carey headed to Atlanta to collaborate with Dupri where the duo wrote and produced `` Shake It Off '' and `` Get Your Number '' , which were eventually released as the album 's third and fourth singles . ( Following this recording session , `` Shake It Off '' was briefly selected as the album 's lead single , replacing the originally planned `` Say Somethin ' '' . ) Carey returned to Atlanta for a second meeting with Dupri ; during this trip , Carey and Dupri penned the last two songs to be included on the album , `` We Belong Together '' and `` It 's Like That '' . In an interview with Billboard , Carey described her sentiments regarding the song during the production stage : </P> <P> I had the chills . I had a great feeling about it when we finished writing the song , and I was flying back from Atlanta at some crazy hour of the morning ... But we were listening to it on the plane ride on the way home , and even from the demo version , I really felt something very special . </P> <P> Carey and her management then decided to release `` It 's Like That '' , which Carey called `` the right fire - starter '' , as the album 's lead single . She later reminisced about her experience with Dupri : `` I am so grateful I went to Atlanta , '' she said . `` And I have to say , we wrote some of my favorite songs on the album . I 'm so proud of Jermaine -- he 's so focused , and he knew what had to be done . '' </P> <H2> Music and structure ( edit ) </H2> <P> `` We Belong Together '' is an R&B ballad . Rolling Stone called it `` soulful . '' The song is propelled by a programmed Roland TR - 808 - styled kick and hi - hat , which is prominently utilized in hip hop music . Reviewer Jennifer Vineyard from MTV News commented that Carey 's spare and understated singing approach gave the song more power , which would not have been achieved if she had belted . The song also incorporates 1980s retro - soul music by `` cleverly '' referencing Bobby Womack 's `` If You Think You 're Lonely Now '' ( 1981 ) and the Deele 's `` Two Occasions '' ( 1987 ) , with Babyface . In the second verse of `` We Belong Together '' , Carey sings : `` Bobby Womack 's on the radio / Singing to me , ' If you think you 're lonely now ' . '' She then flips across a radio dial : `` So I turn the dial , tryin ' to catch a break / And then I hear Babyface / ' I only think of you ... ' . '' The line `` If you think you 're lonely now '' is from the song of the same name and `` I only think of you '' is from the chorus of `` Two Occasions . '' In the remix she also says `` I only think of you / On two occasions / That 's day and night ... '' Due to the inclusion of the lyrics from both songs , the songwriters were given co-writing credits on the song . `` We Belong Together '' follows the common verse - chorus form and is structured into three distinct sections , with each section presenting the protagonist in different emotions . The first section chronicles the break - up of the couple , and a sorrowful tone is established as she laments her former mistakes . In the second section , the narrative switches to the present , and the protagonist becomes increasingly agitated and feels `` all out of her element '' when she attempts to distract herself by listening to the radio , but fails . `` We Belong Together '' does not have a bridge ; instead , Carey transitions into the third section by raising the pitch an octave , which emphasizes the sheer frustration and desperation of the protagonist . Metro Times writer Johnny Loftus described the song 's production , lyrics and vocals in detail : </P> <P> It 's straightforward , heartfelt and classy . Mariah pleads with her departed lover -- ' When you left I lost a part of me / It 's still so hard to believe ' -- and the song 's gentle R&B roll is perfectly understated , built from a few piano chords and a slowed - down So So Def rhythm . It has a homebody quality , almost like an autumn song would -- you can imagine a split - up couple singing it quietly , separately , as the world goes on around them . She 's on a porch with tea ; he 's stuck in traffic when he finds Mariah on the radio . It even cleverly references that feel , with Mariah finding the Bobby Womack and Babyface songs on her radio just too tough to hear . There 's no tired ' I tried to 2 - way you ' retorts , no trash - technology love affair ' I was at the grocery store and this guy had the same ring tone as you , and I cried . ' No , there 's a classic sensibility to the lyrics and sound of ' We Belong Together ' that makes for perfect -- and perfectly universal -- pop / R&B songwriting . In other words , it 's the jam . And there 's probably a happy ending , too : Mariah 's triumphant octave shift finale makes the song 's title an emphatic . </P> <P> `` We Belong Together '' is a simple , understated musical arrangement set in F lydian and composed in 4 / 4 time . Similarly , within the song , Carey 's voice spans from G to the high note of A. Carey 's vocal range is demonstrated with a greater emphasis in the ending chorus , where the chorus is raised an octave higher , lying from G to A. As such , Carey ends with an anticipated coda , completing both the chorus and the song with a potent , belted note of C for approximately four semibreves ( around 17 seconds ) . It follows the common verse - chorus form and is structured into three sections that portray the protagonist in a range of emotions ; from doleful and resigned in the first section , to desperate and agitated in the second . In the last section the song climaxes with an octave raise , which not only emphasizes the protagonist 's heightened desperation , but her determination to be with her lover . The song is written in the key of C major with a slow tempo of 70 beats per minute . Carey 's vocals span from G to A , and the song follows a chord progression of Am -- G -- Em -- F . </P> <H2> Critical reception ( edit ) </H2> <P> `` We Belong Together '' became a `` career re-defining '' song for Carey , at a point when many critics had considered her career over . Unlike most of Carey 's recent singles at that time , `` We Belong Together '' received generally positive reviews from critics , most of whom hailed the song as her `` return to form '' , following reviews for Charmbracelet ( 2002 ) , that suggested Carey had lost her signature vocal range and power . Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine wrote `` the ... diva ( keeps ) cool with breathy , rapid - fire verses until the final full strong - voiced climax that ... proves that ' The Voice ' has indeed returned . '' Additionally , he said that `` The song is as ' innovative ' as Mariah has been in years . '' Other critics commended Carey on her novel singing style which , according to Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times , gave the song its propulsion , writing `` This style is part of the reason why she has been able to turn a ballad into a summer smash . ' We Belong Together ' does n't have a guest rapper , or a hard - hitting beat , but Ms. Carey 's tricky vocal lines give the song more propulsion than you 'd expect , with tightly coiled counter-rhythms that tug against the beat . '' Johnny Loftus from Metro Times called it a `` summer hit '' and wrote `` We all know it 's the intangibles that make a summer single anyway , those untraceable currents that grab the heart and feet , and despite not being an anthem , ' We Belong Together ' is that rousing . '' </P> <P> Writing for Vibe , Michael Ehrlich claimed the song would `` cut across generations '' , while Cinquemani felt it would revive `` faith in Mariah the balladeer '' . Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic chose `` We Belong Together '' as a `` top Pick '' from the album , while Todd Burns from Stylus Magazine described it as `` beautifully cadenced '' . Echoing Cinquemani 's comments about the song and Carey 's past as a balladeer , Jozen Cummings from PopMatters wrote `` Carey makes the song her own , reminding fans of her ' Hero ' days with full , throaty vocals and a crashing climax at the end . The dichotomy between ' The Emancipation of Mimi 's ' first two tracks is the album 's bread and butter . '' Since first hearing the song on the radio , Sherri Winston from South Florida Sun - Sentinel claimed she `` knew it would be a smash '' , complimenting its understated beat and Carey 's vocals . Billboard 's Michael Paoletta described `` We Belong Together '' as one of the album 's strongest cuts , claiming that it highlighted the strongest focal point on the song : Carey 's voice . Slant Magazine ranked it 2nd on their best songs of 2005 list . </P> <H2> Chart performance ( edit ) </H2> Carey performing `` We Belong Together '' on Good Morning America <P> Between 2001 and 2004 , Carey 's popularity had substantially declined and many had considered her career as over . The song spent fourteen non-consecutive weeks at number one on both the US Billboard Hot 100 -- after making its debut at number 81 -- and on the Hot R&B / Hip - Hop Songs chart . It had major cross-over success , becoming the first song to simultaneously occupy the number one position on nine Billboard charts on the week ending August 6 , 2005 : the Hot 100 , Billboard Hot 100 Airplay , Hot R&B / Hip - Hop Songs , Hot R&B / Hip - Hop Airplay , Pop 100 Airplay , Top 40 Mainstream , Rhythmic Airplay Chart , Hot Dance Club Songs , and the Hot Ringtones charts .

Additionally , the song held the top position on the official Hot 100 Airplay chart for sixteen weeks , tying for the second all time spot with No Doubt 's `` Do n't Speak '' ( 1996 ) . `` We Belong Together '' was certified 3\u0445Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) , denoting shipments of a 3 million copies throughout the United States .

Billboard listed `` We Belong Together '' ninth on The Billboard Hot 100 All - Time Top Songs and second on Top Billboard Hot 100 R&B / Hip - Hop Songs . The song was also declared the most popular song of the 2000s decade by Billboard , which makes Carey the first artist to have more than one song being the most popular of a decade , as `` One Sweet Day '' was the most popular song of the 1990s . </P> <P> Besides its success in the United States , `` We Belong Together '' achieved strong charting throughout Europe and Australia .

The song spent a total of eighteen weeks within the singles chart , and has estimated sales of over 240,000 units in the United Kingdom . </P> <H2> Awards and Nominations ( edit ) </H2> <P> `` We Belong Together '' was awarded several prestigious music industry awards throughout 2005 and 2006 . At the 2005 Billboard Music Awards ceremony , Carey won five awards , with the song receiving awards in the `` Rhythmic Top 40 Title of the Year '' , `` Hot 100 song of the Year '' and `` Hot 100 Airplay of the Year '' categories .

The remix features vocals from rappers Jadakiss and Styles P , two - thirds of the hip - hop trio the LOX . The remix is fundamentally different from the original , described as having `` a faster , springier backbeat '' by Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times . Lyrically , the song is similar to the album version of the song , in which both rappers ' verses contemplate on past memories . Styles P raps `` Past is the past , just let it be bygones / Matter of fact I know a fly song that we could vibe on '' , which Sanneh writes `` Cheerfully out of place , he sounds like a man who has wandered into the wrong summertime party , but so what ? He figures he might as well stick around and enjoy it . '' In two separate reviews of The Emancipation of Mimi , Sanneh referred to the song as both `` great '' and `` excellent '' , in regards to the remix . </P> <P> Aside from the album version 's main remix , several others were commissioned and released , although none contained new vocals from Carey . Peter Rauhofer created the `` Reconstruction Mix / Atlantic Soul Vocal Mix '' and `` Atlantic Soul Vocal Mix '' , which both feature a synthetic bass line , a piano and guitar line , and distinctive hi - hats that produce a more up - tempo , hard - hitting beat . </P> <H2> Music video ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Background ( edit ) </H3> <P> The song 's music video premiered worldwide on April 11 , 2005 , although MSN offered an exclusive look at the music video on April 9 . Carey 's `` We Belong Together '' is Yahoo ! Music 's most watched video of 2005 with 7.5 million streamed performances . The video was shot by film director Brett Ratner in Los Angeles alongside the video for Carey 's previous single , `` It 's Like That '' . Carey had collaborated with Ratner several times in the past , having worked on the video for `` Heartbreaker '' , which became one of the most expensive of all time , costing an estimated $2.5 million . The video was filmed through February 9 to February 10 , 2005 , in conjunction with `` It 's Like That '' and serves as the second half to the two - part story . The music video for `` It 's Like That '' features Carey at her bachelorette party set to wed an older and powerful man , played by Eric Roberts . Towards the end of the video , her ex-lover and past flame , played by Wentworth Miller , arrives at the event , and the video concludes with them staring into each other 's eyes as Carey 's soon - to - be husband watches from a balcony . The video for `` We Belong Together '' finishes their tale of love , and features Carey on her wedding day . For the scenes of Carey 's wedding to the older man , she wore her Vera Wang gown she originally wore during her nuptials to Tommy Mottola in 1993 . In an interview with MSNBC , when asked if there was a connection to the use of the dress in the video and reality , Carey responded : </P> <P> The wedding dress was a Vera Wang original dress from a while ago that I actually wore on a certain occasion and had it in storage and when we came up with the concept for the video that had the element of a wedding in it , I said , ' well , I do have my old wedding dress , ' . ' It 's still worth ( sic ) for me ' cause I ca n't believe I was ever married but whatever , end of story . And I knew that we would n't be able to get a fabulous dress like in two days so I just took that dress out of the storage -- it has a 27 - foot train and it was just all hand - beaded and stuff and so I figured we might as well get a use out of it . ' </P> <H3> Synopsis ( edit ) </H3> In the music video , Carey wore her wedding dress from her nuptials to Tommy Mottola in 1993 . She is seen running from the altar , alongside her lover ( Wentworth Miller ) , in the video 's climactic scene . <P> The video features Carey readying for her wedding , and follows her to the altar , as well as her escape from the reception . Many of the actors featured in Carey 's `` It 's Like That '' video were in that of `` We Belong Together '' , which was shot as a continuation from the `` It 's Like That '' video . It begins with a scene of a large mansion , apparently owned by the older man who she is to marry . Carey is seen walking barefoot in a room , shedding a black sheer robe and laying down on a bed draped with white linens . Dressed in lingerie , Carey 's face is shown close - up , as scenes of her tossing in the bed are shown . As the song begins , Carey is seen sitting in front of a large mirror , preparing for her wedding by putting on earrings and shoes , and staring at the ring on her finger . Additional scenes of Carey sitting on a small blue sofa , wearing a purple dress , and Carey staring at the camera during a shower moment are interspersed . The wedding is then shown , with Miller approaching the reception through a stairwell in the back . Small children as seen throwing flowers on the white carpet , followed by Roberts and Carey walking down the aisle . </P> <P> As Carey , now dry and clothed , is shown in another scenario following the dressing scene , a still of Carey and Miller in the video for `` It 's like That '' is shown , during the lyrics `` I ca n't sleep at night / When you are on my mind '' . After several other scenes of Carey dressed in the purple gown and white shirt are interspersed , the altar is displayed , where before being ordained by the minister , Carey looks into her ex-lover's eyes once more . She turns to Roberts , and begins running towards Miller , leaving the reception . As the song 's climax is reached , Carey and Miller are shown running from the reception , as the guests stand up in awe , and watch the pair leave . Carey , dressed in the white shirt , is shown with growing anticipation , crying to the camera and moving her hands and hair . Back at the wedding scene , Carey and her lover get into his vehicle , and drive away as her 27 - foot train hangs behind the car . The video was nominated for `` Best R&B Video '' and `` Best Female Video '' at the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards . </P> <H2> Live performances ( edit ) </H2> <P> Due to its continued chart success , Carey performed `` We Belong Together '' on several live televised performances and included it on the set - lists of all of her tours following its release .

That night , Carey returned to the Grammy stage for the first time since 1996 . Her performance opened with a pre-taped video in which she discussed the importance of God and religion in her life . Carey then came to the stage , dressed in a white Chanel gown , and sang a shortened version of `` We Belong Together '' . Next , Carey 's pastor Clarence Keaton read a Bible passage to open Carey 's performance of `` Fly Like a Bird '' , as he did in the studio recording of the song . Midway through the song , a black temporary wall was removed , revealing a large choir who joined Carey for the song 's gospel climax . The performance earned the night 's only standing ovation , prompting Teri Hatcher , who was presenting the next award , to exclaim , `` It 's like we 've all just been saved ! '' Carey 's performance earned rave reviews from critics . Gary Susman from Entertainment Weekly called Carey the `` comeback queen '' , noting that her voice `` soar ( ed ) into the rafters like only Carey 's can . '' Carey included `` We Belong Together '' on both succeeding tours following its release , the Adventures of Mimi and Angels Advocate Tours . On the former , the song was featured as the encore number , with Carey re-entering the arenas in a form fitting beige evening gown . Backed by three background vocalists , Trey Lorenz , Sherry Tatum , and MaryAnn Tatum , Carey began the song as confetti dropped the arena rafters . According to Jennifer Vineyard from MTV News , the performance was `` a major accomplishment '' , and the highlight of the show , and found Carey re-connect with the audience in ways that she was unable throughout most of the show . Similarly , during her Angel 's Advocate Tour , the song was placed as one of the final numbers on the set - list . Dressed in a black Herve Leger gown , Carey introduced the song as the Billboard 's `` song of the decade '' , and thanked the audience for making it her 16th number - one single in the United States . Following the song 's completion , Carey exited the arena for a few moments , before returning to perform `` Hero '' as the encore . </P> <H2> Formats and track listings ( edit ) </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Td> <P> Australian CD single </P> <Ol> <Li> `` We Belong Together '' -- 3 : 22 </Li> <Li> `` We Belong Together '' ( Reconstruction Radio Mix ) -- 4 : 05 </Li> <Li> `` It 's Like That ( Remix ) '' ( feat .
