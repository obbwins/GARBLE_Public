The National Football Conference ( NFC ) champion Philadelphia Eagles defeated the American Football Conference ( AFC ) and defending Super Bowl LI champion New England Patriots , 41 -- 33 , to win their first Super Bowl and their first NFL title since 1960 . The game was played on February 4 , 2018 , at U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis , Minnesota . This was the second time that a Super Bowl was played in Minneapolis , the northernmost city to ever host the event , after Super Bowl XXVI at the Metrodome during the 1991 season , and the sixth Super Bowl held in a cold - weather city . </P> <P> New England finished the regular season with an AFC - best 13 -- 3 record , then extended their record Super Bowl appearances to ten , their third in four years , and their eighth under the leadership of head coach Bill Belichick and quarterback Tom Brady . Philadelphia also finished the regular season with an NFC - best 13 -- 3 record , a year after Dallas did it in 2016 , but became underdogs entering the playoffs after starting quarterback Carson Wentz suffered a season - ending injury late in the regular season and was replaced by journeyman backup Nick Foles . Still , the Eagles advanced to their third Super Bowl appearance , having previously lost to the Oakland Raiders in Super Bowl XV and to the Patriots in Super Bowl XXXIX . </P> <P> Several records were set during Super Bowl LII , including most yards gained in an NFL game by both teams combined ( 1,151 ) , the fewest punts from both teams in a Super Bowl ( one ) , and the most points scored by a Super Bowl losing team ( 33 ) . The game was settled after the Eagles converted a fumble recovery deep within Patriots territory to a field goal with 1 : 05 remaining to extend their lead to eight points , and Brady 's Hail Mary pass fell incomplete as time expired . Foles , who completed 28 of 43 pass attempts for 373 yards and three touchdowns with one interception , and caught a one - yard touchdown pass , was named Super Bowl MVP . Foles ' touchdown catch later became known as The Philly Special and joined NFL lore . </P> <P> The broadcast of the game on NBC had the smallest Super Bowl audience in nine years , with an average of 103.4 million viewers . Average TV viewership for the halftime show , headlined by Justin Timberlake , was 106.6 million American television viewers , 9 percent less than the previous year . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Background <Ul> <Li> 1.1 Host - city selection </Li> <Li> 1.2 Teams <Ul> <Li> 1.2. 1 Philadelphia Eagles </Li> <Li> 1.2. 2 New England Patriots </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 1.3 Playoffs </Li> <Li> 1.4 Pre-game notes <Ul> <Li> 1.4. 1 Operations </Li> <Li> 1.4. 2 Associated events </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 Broadcasting <Ul> <Li> 2.1 United States <Ul> <Li> 2.1. 1 Advertising </Li> <Li> 2.1. 2 Lead - out programs </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2.2 International broadcasts </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Entertainment <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Pre-game </Li> <Li> 3.2 Halftime show </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Game summary <Ul> <Li> 4.1 First Quarter </Li> <Li> 4.2 Second Quarter </Li> <Li> 4.3 Third Quarter </Li> <Li> 4.4 Fourth Quarter </Li> <Li> 4.5 Game statistics </Li> <Li> 4.6 Box score </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 5 Final statistics <Ul> <Li> 5.1 Statistical comparison </Li> <Li> 5.2 Individual statistics </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 6 Starting lineups </Li> <Li> 7 Officials </Li> <Li> 8 References </Li> <Li> 9 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Background ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Host - city selection ( edit ) </H3> The U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis , Minnesota , where Super Bowl LII was held . <P> On October 8 , 2013 , the league announced that three venues would vie to host Super Bowl LII : </P> <Ul> <Li> U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis , Minnesota . Minneapolis hosted Super Bowl XXVI in 1992 at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome , which was torn down after the 2013 season and replaced in 2014 and 2015 by U.S. Bank Stadium . </Li> <Li> Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis , Indiana . The stadium hosted Super Bowl XLVI in 2012 . </Li> <Li> Mercedes - Benz Superdome in New Orleans , Louisiana . The city has hosted 10 Super Bowls , including seven at the Superdome , most recently Super Bowl XLVII in 2013 . </Li> </Ul> <P> On May 20 , 2014 , the league 's owners picked Minneapolis at their meeting in Atlanta , Georgia . </P> <H3> Teams ( edit ) </H3> <P> The NFC was represented by the number - one playoff seed Philadelphia Eagles , while the AFC was represented by the number - one playoff seed New England Patriots , marking the fourth time in the previous five years that the Super Bowl had featured the top team from each conference . </P> Philadelphia Eagles ( edit ) Main article : 2017 Philadelphia Eagles season Nick Foles in 2014 . <P> The Eagles finished the regular season with a record of 13 -- 3 , the same as New England , Minnesota , and Pittsburgh , but the various tie - breaking provisions gave them the NFC 's top seed in the 2017 -- 18 NFL playoffs . It was a substantial improvement for the team under second - year head coach Doug Pederson ; the Eagles finished the two previous seasons with 7 -- 9 records . In the 2017 season , the team scored 457 points ( third in the NFL ) , while giving up just 295 ( fourth ) points . </P> <P> The offense was led by Pro Bowl quarterback Carson Wentz . In just his second season , he recorded a passer rating of 101.9 , throwing for 3,296 yards and 33 touchdowns , with only seven interceptions . His top target was Pro Bowl tight end Zach Ertz , who caught 74 passes for 824 yards and eight touchdowns . Other contributors were two receivers acquired from off - season free agency : Alshon Jeffery , who caught 57 passes for 789 yards and nine scores ; and Torrey Smith , who had 36 receptions for 430 yards . Meanwhile , third - year receiver Nelson Agholor had the best season of his career , hauling in 62 passes for 768 yards and eight touchdowns , a higher total in each category than in his previous two seasons combined . The Eagles rushing attack also benefited from two recently acquired players , LeGarrette Blount and Jay Ajayi . Blount , an off - season signing who won a Super Bowl with the Patriots , gained 776 rushing yards and two touchdowns , while Ajayi , picked up by a mid-season trade with the Miami Dolphins , rushed for 873 yards and caught 24 passes for 154 yards combined with the two teams . Philadelphia also had a superb offensive line , lead by two Pro Bowl selections : Tackle Lane Johnson and Guard Brandon Brooks . </P> <P> The Eagles defense allowed the fourth - fewest yards in the league ( 4,904 ) . Defensive tackle Fletcher Cox made the Pro Bowl for the third time in his career , recording 5 \u200b \u2044 sacks and two fumble recoveries , and he had plenty of help around him , such as former Patriots defensive end Chris Long , who had five sacks and forced four fumbles , and defensive end Brandon Graham , who led the team with 9 \u200b \u2044 sacks . Middle linebacker Nigel Bradham led the team in combined tackles with 88 . The Eagles secondary featured Pro Bowl safety Malcolm Jenkins , who had 76 combined tackles and two interceptions , along with cornerback Patrick Robinson , who led the team with four interceptions . </P> <P> Philadelphia had stormed to the top of the NFC by winning 10 of their first 12 games , but suffered a major setback on December 10 , when Wentz went down with a season - ending ACL tear and was replaced by journeyman backup quarterback Nick Foles , who was playing for his third team in as many years and his second stint with the Eagles . Still , Foles was able to lead the team to victory in that game , as well as the next two . The Eagles lost a meaningless week 17 matchup with the Cowboys led by third - string quarterback Nate Sudfeld . Then in their two playoff games , Foles threw for a combined total of 598 yards , three touchdowns and no interceptions . </P> New England Patriots ( edit ) Main article : 2017 New England Patriots season Tom Brady in 2016 . <P> The Patriots entered the 2017 NFL season as defending Super Bowl champions . For the 16th time in their 18 seasons under 65 - year old coach Bill Belichick , they recorded a double - digit win season , finishing the regular season with a record of 13 -- 3 , one of four teams ( along with Philadelphia , Minnesota , and Pittsburgh ) with that record . By virtue of the tie - breaking procedures , they were granted the AFC 's number one overall seed in the 2017 -- 18 NFL playoffs . The previous season 's top wide receiver Julian Edelman went down in the preseason with a season - ending injury . Early season defensive struggles left the team with a 2 -- 2 record after four weeks , and the worst overall defense in the league at that point . The defense came together as a unit , and tighten up over the rest of the season however , with the Patriots going 11 -- 1 after week 4 . Their sole loss in the latter part of the season came in Week 14 to the Miami Dolphins , a division rival , though they were without star tight end Rob Gronkowski due to a one - game suspension for an unnecessary roughness call the prior week . The Patriots ' defense was improved by several late - season free - agent signings , including Eric Lee , a defensive end , previously from the Buffalo Bills , whom the Patriots signed in Week 12 , and James Harrison , a perennial All - Pro for the Pittsburgh Steelers , whom the Patriots picked up off waivers after Christmas . In just six games for New England , Lee recorded 3 \u200b \u2044 sacks , a safety , and an interception . In his only regular season game with the Patriots , Harrison recorded two sacks . </P> <P> During the regular season , New England 's offense led the league in yards gained ( 6,307 ) and ranked second in points scored ( 458 ) . The 40 - year - old Brady finished his 18th season with a league - leading 4,577 passing yards , 32 touchdowns and just eight interceptions , earning him his 13th selection to the Pro Bowl and his third league MVP award . One change that helped make up for the loss of Edelman was the acquisition of receiver Brandin Cooks , who caught 65 passes for 1,082 yards and seven touchdowns . Brady was also aided by the healthy return of Gronkowski , who had played just eight games in the previous season , finishing this year with 69 catches for 1,084 yards and eight scores . Receiver Danny Amendola added 61 receptions for 659 yards , as well as another 240 yards returning punts . With the loss of their previous season 's rushing leader LeGarrette Blount to free agency , Dion Lewis stepped up to take the lead , rushing for 896 yards and six touchdowns despite starting only eight games . He also caught 32 passes for 214 yards and two touchdowns and added 570 yards and another touchdown returning kickoffs . Rex Burkhead chipped in 518 all - purpose yards , 30 receptions , and eight touchdowns . In passing situations , the team relied heavily on running back James White , who caught 56 passes for 429 yards and rushed for 171 on the ground . These backs were aided by the blocking of fullback James Develin , who earned his first Pro Bowl selection . On special teams , kicker Stephen Gostkowski ranked second in the NFL with 156 points and fourth in field goals made with 37 , while veteran special team ace Matthew Slater earned his seventh consecutive Pro Bowl selection . </P> <P> The Patriots ' defense ranked only 29th in yards allowed ( 5,856 ) , but ranked fifth in fewest points , giving up only 296 . Defensive end Trey Flowers led the team with 6 \u200b \u2044 sacks while also forcing two fumbles . Linebacker Kyle Van Noy had 73 tackles and 5 \u200b \u2044 sacks . The Patriots also had a superb secondary , led by cornerbacks Malcolm Butler ( two interceptions , three forced fumbles ) and Stephon Gilmore ( two interceptions , 47 solo tackles ) , as well as safeties Devin McCourty ( 97 combined tackles , one interception , one fumble recovery ) , Patrick Chung ( 84 tackles , one interception , two fumble recoveries ) and Duron Harmon ( four interceptions ) . </P> <H3> Playoffs ( edit ) </H3> Main article : 2017 -- 18 NFL playoffs <P> In the playoffs , the Patriots earned a first - round bye and home - field advantage due to their status as the AFC 's first overall seed . In the divisional round , they defeated the Tennessee Titans 35 -- 14 , as Brady passed for 337 yards and three touchdowns . In that game , the defense amassed eight quarterback sacks of Marcus Mariota and held the Titans ' running game to 65 yards rushing . They then defeated the Jacksonville Jaguars 24 -- 20 in the AFC Championship Game , rallying from behind to win the game after the Jaguars jumped out to an early 14 -- 3 lead and whose league - best defense stymied Brady and the rest of the offense for most of the first half . Down 20 -- 10 in the fourth quarter , the Patriots comeback was sealed by two Brady - led drives , both resulting in touchdown passes to Danny Amendola , as well as a key defensive stop by Stephon Gilmore , whose acrobatic block of a Blake Bortles pass ended Jacksonville 's last chance to score . Rob Gronkowski was injured in the game with a concussion , leaving his status for the Super Bowl in doubt . Amendola was the breakout star for the Patriots during their two playoff wins , leading the team with 196 receiving yards , and serving as Brady 's primary target . </P> <P> Meanwhile , Philadelphia started off the divisional round by narrowly defeating the Atlanta Falcons 15 -- 10 , by stopping the Falcons on four consecutive plays after they had a first - down - and - goal situation on the Eagles 9 - yard line during their final drive . They then soundly defeated the Minnesota Vikings 38 -- 7 in the NFC Championship Game . Despite the Vikings scoring on their opening drive , the Eagles defense held them to three punts , two turnovers on downs , two interceptions , and one lost fumble in their remaining drives of the game . Meanwhile , Foles had a great game , in which he completed 26 of 33 passes for 353 yards and three touchdowns . </P> <H3> Pre-game notes ( edit ) </H3> <P> This game was a rematch of Super Bowl XXXIX . Only one player , Patriots starting quarterback Tom Brady , remained on either roster from that contest . Bill Belichick , the Patriots ' head coach in that contest , also remained in that position . Two Eagles , running back LeGarrette Blount and defensive lineman Chris Long , had been Patriots in 2017 's Super Bowl LI . </P> <P> The Patriots were the designated home team for Super Bowl LII , because the AFC team is the designated home team in even - numbered years and the NFC team in odd - numbered years . As the designated home team , the Patriots chose to wear their road white jerseys with navy blue pants , becoming the sixth team to wear their white jerseys as the home team and the third team to wear white in back - to - back Super Bowls , following the Dallas Cowboys in Super Bowls XII and XIII and again in Super Bowls XXVII and XXVIII . The Eagles therefore wore their standard home uniform of midnight green jerseys with white pants . Twelve of the previous 13 Super Bowls had been won by teams wearing white jerseys . The last team to win a Super Bowl while wearing their home uniforms was the Green Bay Packers in Super Bowl XLV ( who , coincidentally , had also worn green jerseys ) . </P> Operations ( edit ) Security prescreening at the Mall of America before boarding the Metro Blue Line to U.S. Bank Stadium . <P> To coordinate the game and 10 days of events , the National Football League temporarily operated an events office within the Minnesota Vikings office building next to U.S. Bank Stadium . More than 150,000 visitors were expected to attend events associated with the Super Bowl over ten days . Among them were some 5,000 - plus media members ; media day events and press conferences were held at The Mall of America in Bloomington , Minnesota . </P> <P> No sales tax was collected on admission tickets to the game and related events , including parking . </P> <P> To increase security around U.S. Bank Stadium , the stadium 's light rail station was shut down for 48 hours before the game , and a nearby homeless shelter was temporarily moved beyond the security perimeter . The Blue Line of the light rail system was only open to ticketholders and passengers with a Gameday Pass , while the Green Line only ran to Stadium Village station on the University of Minnesota campus before continuing on with restricted access . Metro Transit ran shuttle buses between light rail stations , as well as regular bus service was moved for several weeks due to street closures . Thirty activist groups organized a rally and protest against police brutality , corporate greed , and racist practices . 17 people blocked the Green Line train for 90 minutes before the game , and 200 protesters blocked an entrance to the stadium 's security perimeter . </P> <P> Under a 1998 agreement , the Patriots and Eagles owners split the tickets , and the league controlled the game presentation and entertainment in the stadium . The Patriots practiced at the Minnesota Vikings facilities in Eden Prairie while the Eagles used the University of Minnesota . The Eagles got the Vikings ' locker room and sideline . The Vikings had advanced to the NFC Championship Game before losing to the Eagles ; until that point , the possibility of the Vikings advancing to the Super Bowl and thus becoming the first team to play the game in its home stadium was plausible . Had that happened , the Vikings would have used their own locker rooms and training facilities , while the AFC champion would have used the University of Minnesota . </P> Associated events ( edit ) Nicollet Mall hosted the outdoor Super Bowl Live festival during the lead - up to the game . <P> The Minnesota Super Bowl Host Committee presented Super Bowl Live on Nicollet Mall in downtown Minneapolis . This ten - day free festival and concert series featured Sheila E. , the Revolution , Morris Day and the Time , and the New Power Generation , musicians from Minnesota who collaborated with Prince , a Minneapolis native . Produced by Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis , Super Bowl Live also included performances by Idina Menzel , Soul Asylum , the Suburbs , Bob Mould , Sounds of Blackness , Dessa , VocalEssence , Mint Condition , and the Jets . In addition to the concert series , Super Bowl Live featured a 200 - foot ( 61 m ) American Birkebeiner International Bridge on Nicollet Mall to showcase cross-country skiing , skijoring , fat - tire bicycle racing , and snow tubing demonstrations . There was also a snowmobile stunt show on February 3 . </P> <P> The NFL presented the Super Bowl Experience at the Minneapolis Convention Center from January 27 to February 3 with an entrance fee . Kelly Clarkson performed at the Minneapolis Armory and a U.S. Bank Stadium lounge on the day of the Super Bowl . </P> <P> The Minneapolis Armory also hosted Jennifer Lopez , Imagine Dragons , and Pink concerts close to U.S. Bank Stadium . Pink also performed the national anthem before the Super Bowl . Halftime performer Justin Timberlake held a ticketed `` listening session '' of his newest album at Prince 's Paisley Park . Dave Matthews Band will perform at Xcel Energy Center in Saint Paul . The Shakopee Mdewakanton Sioux Community 's Mystic Lake Casino hosted Gwen Stefani , the Chainsmokers , Florida Georgia Line , and Kygo . Planners originally scheduled a 64,000 - square - foot ( 5,900 m ) traveling nightclub for 9500 people , but cancelled , moving its concerts into the main casino . Ellie Goulding 's appearance with Kygo was cancelled at the same time . The Mystic Lake Casino in Prior Lake , Minnesota , has the second - largest hotel in the Twin Cities metropolitan area , and Prior Lake hosted Super Bowl - week events including winter activities , a hotdish competition , and fundraisers . </P> <P> Other events were held at the Mall of America ( including Radio Row as a home for national shows ) , Saint Paul 's RiverCentre and Xcel Energy Center , the Minnesota Vikings ' Winter Park location in Eden Prairie , and the University of Minnesota . `` Taste of the NFL '' is a fundraiser for food banks and was held in Saint Paul . Minneapolis also offered a temporary zip - line across the Mississippi River near downtown . The Luminary Loppet around Lake of the Isles in Minneapolis featured fire dancing , an ice pyramid , and luminary candles at night . </P> <P> The 2018 Saint Paul Winter Carnival took place leading up to , during and after the Super Bowl . Carnival organizers built a large ice palace to coincide with the Super Bowl festivities , as with Super Bowl XXVI in 1992 . The ice palace was planned , cancelled for lack of funds , then re-announced with sponsors . Events in Saint Paul will also include an extreme sports demonstration , a `` giant slide '' , and a block party . Officials in the capital city hoped to attract Minneapolis Super Bowl visitors . The Minneapolis Institute of Art had a free 20 - by - 40 - foot ( 6.1 m \u00d7 12.2 m ) , 6 - foot - tall ( 1.8 m ) ice maze . </P> <P> The Great Northern was a winter festival in the Twin Cities from January 25 to February 4 that included the U.S. Pond Hockey Championships , an ice bar , and an `` urban ski competition '' . </P> <P> ESPN broadcast its studio programming from the IDS Center in downtown Minneapolis , while Golf Channel ( a sister network of Super Bowl LII broadcaster NBC ) aired two live episodes of David Feherty 's eponymous series from the State Theatre . </P> <P> Native American communities of Minnesota performed nightly drum ceremonies . Various drumlines from around the state performed at different locations throughout the day . </P> <H2> Broadcasting ( edit ) </H2> <H3> United States ( edit ) </H3> <P> NBC broadcast Super Bowl LII , as part of an annual cycle between the three main broadcast television partners of the NFL . NBC 's lead NFL team of play - by - play man Al Michaels and color analyst Cris Collinsworth called the game . Sister cable network Universo carried a full Spanish language broadcast produced by Telemundo Deportes , with Edgar Lopez and Rene Giraldo . The Universo Spanish audio was also available on NBC through the SAP channel , where available . NBC employed 73 cameras within the stadium , and introduced `` volumetric - AR '' graphics featuring 3D body scanning of players . </P> <P> This was the last game in Westwood One 's current national radio contract with the NFL . Each participating team 's flagship station ( the Patriots Radio Network 's WBZ - FM / Boston , and the Eagles Radio Network 's WIP - FM / Philadelphia , along with WEMG / Camden , New Jersey for Spanish play - by - play ) carried the game with local announcers . ( For the second consecutive year , none of the local flagships are clear - channel stations , and thus the local commentators were only audible for free within each respective team 's immediate metropolitan area ; listeners who live outside the flagship stations ' broadcast ranges were required to subscribe to Sirius XM Radio or TuneIn Premium to access the local broadcasts . ) Under the terms of the Westwood One contract , any radio station that is not a local flagship , if it is to carry the game , is required to utilize the Westwood One feed . It was the first title win called by Eagles play - by - play announcer Merrill Reese , who has been the primary radio voice of the team since 1977 . </P> <P> Online streams of the game were provided by NBC . It was available on NBCSports.com , the NBC Sports app for mobile devices , tablets , connected - TV devices , and NBC.com without any required login . The Spanish - language broadcast was available on the Telemundo Deportes En Vivo app and TelemundoDeportes.com for desktop devices , connected TV devices , and tablets but not mobile devices . Under new digital rights deals that began with the 2017 -- 18 playoffs , Verizon still offers mobile streaming of games , but no longer holds exclusive rights to stream NFL games on smartphones or make them exclusive to Verizon Wireless subscribers . Instead , Verizon elected to use the deal to bolster its recent acquisition of Yahoo ! ; on January 9 , 2018 , Verizon announced that it would host streams of playoff games through the Yahoo ! Sports and go90 app , including Super Bowl LII . As a result of the deal , the online stream was available to viewers on all Internet devices for the first time , regardless of network ( because of Verizon 's previous exclusive rights deal , non-Verizon phones had previously been blocked from receiving any NFL telecasts , regardless of source ) . The game was also available through the NFL Mobile app with the aforementioned change to viewing through the app now being allowed on all mobile carriers . </P> <P> Dan Patrick and Liam McHugh served as the lead hosts for NBC 's pre-game coverage . Mike Tirico , who replaced the retiring Bob Costas in 2017 as NBC 's lead studio host for both the NFL and the Olympic Games , did not participate in coverage of Super Bowl LII due to his commitments to prepare for the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang , South Korea ( which opened on the Friday following the game ) . </P> <P> As NBC Sports Regional Networks operates regional sports networks in the markets of both teams which participated , the NBC Sports Boston and NBC Sports Philadelphia channels were used to provide additional coverage of the game from a local perspective . Both networks aired coverage from Minneapolis , including pre-game specials focusing on their respective team , followed by a joint broadcast immediately prior to the game . </P> <P> Nielsen reported a 47.4 / 70 % overnight rating in metered markets , peaking at 52.2 / 74 during the fourth quarter . These numbers are about 3 % lower than early numbers from Super Bowl LI , and the lowest since Super Bowl XLIV in 2010 . </P> Advertising ( edit ) <P> Dan Lovinger , NBC Sports Group executive vice president of ad sales , stated to Variety in July 2017 that the network was seeking a price `` north of $5 million '' ( the price set for the previous two Super Bowls ) for a 30 - second commercial during Super Bowl LII . As they began five days after the Super Bowl , NBC offered advertising packages that covered both Super Bowl LII and the 2018 Winter Olympics ( which marked the first time since 1992 that a single broadcast network had aired both the Super Bowl and Winter Olympics in the same year ) ; the network estimated that it would bring in at least $1 billion in advertising revenue from the two events . During the second quarter , an equipment failure caused NBC 's broadcast to experience dead air for 30 seconds during a commercial break . No actual commercial time was lost . </P> <P> Anheuser - Busch has , as it has done in previous Super Bowls , purchased multiple commercials in the game , advertising Bud Light , Stella Artois and Michelob Ultra . For the first time since Super Bowl VIII , the company reduced the appearances of the Budweiser Clydesdales in a Super Bowl commercial . However , a Clydesdale was featured in a commercial for Tide detergent and the Budweiser Clydesdales only appeared in a 5 - second Budweiser commercial to remind viewers of the `` ClydesdaleCam '' livestreaming event . Other signed advertisers included The Coca - Cola Company and Avocados from Mexico . Cellphone carrier T - Mobile aired a minute long ad with actress Kerry Washington narrating , featuring babies of various ethnic backgrounds . The commercial also features Nirvana 's song `` All Apologies '' played as a lullaby . In the ad , Washington talks about the babies being born with natural instincts of love and not racism calling them `` unstoppable '' and that they will demand fair and equal pay . T - Mobile CEO John Legere posted to his Twitter account afterwards saying , `` This year , we wanted to use our # SuperBowl airtime to share that @ TMobile believes we all started in the same place .

The Patriots kicked off to the Eagles , who opened the game with a 14 - play , 67 - yard drive that took 7 : 05 off the clock and resulted in a 25 - yard Jake Elliott field goal , giving the Eagles a 3 -- 0 lead . The drive was controlled by the arm of Eagles quarterback Nick Foles , who completed 6 of 9 passes to five different receivers for 61 yards , with a few short runs by LeGarrette Blount and Jay Ajayi mixed in . Foles also made two critical completions on third down plays , hitting Alshon Jeffery for a 17 - yard gain on third - and - 4 , and later found Torrey Smith for a 15 - yard completion on third - and - 12 . The Patriots responded with a drive of their own , almost with the exact same results ; quarterback Tom Brady completed 6 of 8 passes for 60 yards to four different receivers , the longest a 28 - yard strike to Chris Hogan . The drive stalled out on the Eagles 8 - yard line , where they had to settle for Stephen Gostkowski 's 26 - yard field goal , which tied the game at 3 -- 3 . The game 's first touchdown was scored by the Eagles on the next drive , taking only three plays : a short pass from Foles to Nelson Agholor , a 36 - yard run up the middle by Blount , and a 34 - yard touchdown pass from Foles to Jeffery to the left side of the field . The ensuing extra point attempt from Elliott was missed wide right , which made the score 9 -- 3 in favor of the Eagles . The Patriots responded by advancing the ball to the Philadelphia 11 - yard line on their next drive , which was set up by a 50 - yard completion from Brady to Danny Amendola , where the quarter ended . </P> <H3> Second quarter ( edit ) </H3> <P> With the second quarter under way , the Patriots came away empty - handed on the drive , as Gostkowski missed a 26 - yard field goal attempt after holder Ryan Allen mishandled the snap . New England 's defense forced the game 's only punt on the next drive . On the following drive , Brady completed a 23 - yard pass to Brandin Cooks , but a hard hit by defender Malcolm Jenkins knocked the receiver out of the game with a concussion . On third down from near mid-field , the Patriots attempted a trick play that involved two handoffs and a pass downfield to Tom Brady . Brady was open , but dropped the throw from Amendola . They went for it on fourth down , and a pass intended for tight end Rob Gronkowski fell incomplete , giving the Eagles the ball on their own 35 - yard line on a turnover - on - downs . The Eagles capitalized on a drive featuring two key completions , a 19 - yard catch by Zach Ertz on third - and - 7 , and a 22 - yard reception by Jeffery on the Patriots 21 - yard line . On the next play , a 21 - yard rumble by Blount gave the Eagles another touchdown . They attempted a two - point conversion , which failed and brought the score to 15 -- 3 . The Patriots quickly struck back , as Brady completed a 46 - yard pass to Rex Burkhead on the first play after the kickoff . But the team could only gain two more yards , resulting in Gostkowski 's 45 - yard field goal that got the score to 15 -- 6 . The Eagles got the ball back with 7 : 24 on the clock and looked poised to score another touchdown , when a 26 - yard run by Ajayi gave them a first down on the Patriots 43 - yard line . But on the next play , Foles threw a pass that bounced off Jeffery as he tried to make a one - handed catch , and went into the hands of Patriots safety Duron Harmon for an interception , which he returned eight yards to the 10 - yard line . The Patriots took advantage of the turnover with a seven - play , 90 - yard drive , featuring a 43 - yard completion from Brady to Hogan . On the next play , James White scored with a 26 - yard touchdown run . Gostkowski missed the ensuing extra point , but the score was now 15 -- 12 . Eagles running back Kenjon Barner returned the ensuing kickoff 27 yards to his own 30 - yard line as time ran down to the two - minute warning . Two plays later , on third down - and - 3 , Foles completed a short pass to running back Corey Clement , who took off for a 55 - yard gain to the New England 8 - yard line . Clement then ran the ball six yards to the two - yard line on the next play . Two plays later , Philadelphia faced fourth - and - goal on the 1 - yard line with 38 seconds left on the clock . Deciding to go for the touchdown , they attempted a similar trick play to the one that had failed for the Patriots earlier . As Foles stepped up to the running back position , Clement took a direct snap and pitched the ball to tight end Trey Burton , who then threw the ball perfectly to Foles , who was wide open in the right side of the end zone . Foles caught the football , making him the first quarterback ever to catch a touchdown pass in a Super Bowl , and the ensuing extra point was good , giving the Eagles a 22 -- 12 lead , which was taken into the locker room following a short drive by the Patriots . </P> <P> The first half resulted in numerous Super Bowl records from both teams , including most total yards combined ( 673 ) . This was also the first time two quarterbacks had thrown for over 200 yards in the first half of a Super Bowl , with Brady throwing for 276 yards and Foles throwing for 215 yards . </P> <H3> Third quarter ( edit ) </H3> <P> The Patriots received the second - half kickoff and Brady led New England 75 yards in eight plays . Gronkowski , who only caught one pass for nine yards in the first half , caught five passes for 68 yards on the drive , the last a 5 - yard touchdown reception to make the score 22 -- 19 . The Eagles responded by moving the ball 85 yards in 11 plays on a drive that consumed less than five minutes and featured three critical third down conversions by Foles . The first was a 17 - yard pass to Agholor on third - and - 6 from the Eagles 19 - yard line . Later in the drive , he threw a 14 - yard completion to Ertz on third - and - 1 from the New England 40 - yard line . Finally , he finished the possession with a 22 - yard touchdown pass to Clement on third - and - 6 . The touchdown was held up by a replay review , but replay officials confirmed that Clement kept both feet inbounds and controlled the ball . An Elliott extra point brought the score to 29 -- 19 in favor of the Eagles . Brady responded with a 10 - play , 75 - yard drive , completing all three of his passes for 61 yards , the last one a 26 - yard touchdown pass to Hogan that brought the score to 29 -- 26 . The Eagles followed with an 8 - play , 51 - yard drive featuring a 24 - yard completion from Foles to Agholor on the first play . By the end of the third quarter , the team had made it to the New England 16 - yard line . </P> <H3> Fourth quarter ( edit ) </H3> <P> The Eagles opened the fourth quarter scoring with a Jake Elliott field goal to bring the score to 32 -- 26 . However , Brady came back with another 75 - yard drive featuring a 30 - yard reception by Amendola and ending with a four - yard pass to Gronkowski , his second touchdown of the game , giving the Patriots their first lead of the game with the score at 33 -- 32 . On their next drive , the Eagles faced third - and - 6 after two plays , but were able to keep the ball with a 7 - yard catch by Ertz . Eventually , they faced a fourth - and - 1 on their own 45 - yard line with 5 : 39 left in the game . Deciding to go for the conversion rather than punt , Foles completed a 2 - yard pass to Ertz that kept the drive alive . Then after a 1 - yard Blount run , he picked up three consecutive first downs with three passes to Agholor for gains of 10 , 18 , and 10 yards , respectively , moving the ball to the New England 14 - yard line . Following a 3 - yard run by Ajayi , Foles threw a 9 - yard touchdown pass to Ertz with 2 : 21 remaining in the game . The play was held up on review , as Ertz lost the ball after touching the ground in the end zone ; it was however determined that he established himself as a runner and also maintained control of the ball as he broke the plane of the goal line . However , a failed two - point conversion left the Eagles with a 38 -- 33 lead . On the Patriots ' next drive , Eagles defensive end Brandon Graham stripped the ball from Brady on the drive 's second play for the only sack of the game for either team . Defensive end Derek Barnett of the Eagles recovered the ball , allowing the Eagles to run the clock down to 1 : 05 and forcing New England to use up all their remaining timeouts . Elliott then kicked a 46 - yard field goal , putting Philadelphia ahead by eight points , with the score at 41 -- 33 , and New England needing a touchdown and a two - point conversion to tie the game and send it into overtime . After nine plays ( one of them a 13 - yard catch by Amendola on fourth - and - 10 ) , Brady reached the 49 - yard line , and with only nine seconds remaining , he threw a Hail Mary pass to the end zone , to no avail as time expired . The Eagles had won their first Vince Lombardi Trophy in franchise history , and their first league championship since 1960 , ending what was the third - longest championship drought in the NFL at 57 years . </P> <H3> Game Statistics ( edit ) </H3> The trophy presentation after the game . <P> The combined 74 points scored by both teams was one point shy of the Super Bowl record of 75 , set in Super Bowl XXIX in 1995 ; it and this game marked only the second time in the game 's history where the two teams combined for 70 + points .
