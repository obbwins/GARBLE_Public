For the song by Dick Farrelly , see Isle of Innisfree . The Lake Isle of Innisfree <P> I will arise and go now , and go to Innisfree , And a small cabin build there , of clay and wattles made ; Nine bean rows will I have there , a hive for the honey bee , And live alone in the bee - loud glade . And I shall have some peace there , for peace comes dropping slow , Dropping from the veils of the morning to where the cricket sings ; There midnight 's all a glimmer , and noon a purple glow , And evening full of the linnet 's wings . I will arise and go now , for always night and day I hear lake water lapping with low sounds by the shore ; While I stand on the roadway , or on the pavements grey , I hear it in the deep heart 's core . -- W.B. Yeats </P> <P> `` The Lake Isle of Innisfree '' is a twelve - line poem composed of three quatrains written by William Butler Yeats in 1888 and first published in the National Observer in 1890 . It was reprinted in The Countess Kathleen and Various Legends and Lyrics in 1892 and as an illustrated Cuala Press Broadside in 1932 . </P> <P> `` The Lake Isle of Innisfree '' exemplifies the style of the Celtic Revival : it is an attempt to create a form of poetry that was Irish in origin rather than one that adhered to the standards set by English poets and critics . It received critical acclaim in the United Kingdom and France . </P> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> Wikisource has original text related to this article : Lake Isle of Innisfree </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Background </Li> <Li> 2 Analysis </Li> <Li> 3 Musical settings </Li> <Li> 4 In other media </Li> <Li> 5 References </Li> <Li> 6 See also </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Background ( edit ) </H2> Photograph of William Butler Yeats taken in 1890 <P> The Isle of Innisfree is an uninhabited island within Lough Gill , in County Sligo , Ireland , where Yeats spent his summers as a child . Yeats describes the inspiration for the poem coming from a `` sudden '' memory of his childhood while walking down Fleet Street in London in 1888 . He writes , `` I had still the ambition , formed in Sligo in my teens , of living in imitation of Thoreau on Innisfree , a little island in Lough Gill , and when walking through Fleet Street very homesick I heard a little tinkle of water and saw a fountain in a shop - window which balanced a little ball upon its jet , and began to remember lake water . From the sudden remembrance came my poem `` Innisfree , '' my first lyric with anything in its rhythm of my own music . I had begun to loosen rhythm as an escape from rhetoric and from that emotion of the crowd that rhetoric brings , but I only understood vaguely and occasionally that I must for my special purpose use nothing but the common syntax . A couple of years later I could not have written that first line with its conventional archaism -- `` Arise and go '' -- nor the inversion of the last stanza . '' </P> <H2> Analysis ( edit ) </H2> <P> The twelve - line poem is divided into three quatrains and is an example of Yeats 's earlier lyric poems . Throughout the three short quatrains the poem explores the speaker 's longing for the peace and tranquility of Innisfree while residing in an urban setting . The speaker in this poem yearns to return to the island of Innisfree because of the peace and quiet it affords . He can escape the noise of the city and be lulled by the `` lake water lapping with low sounds by the shore . '' On this small island , he can return to nature by growing beans and having bee hives , by enjoying the `` purple glow '' of noon , the sounds of birds ' wings , and , of course , the bees . He can even build a cabin and stay on the island much as Thoreau , the American Transcendentalist , who lived in this manner on Walden Pond . During Yeats 's lifetime it was -- to his annoyance -- one of his most popular poems and on one occasion was recited ( or sung ) in his honor by two ( or ten -- accounts vary ) thousand boy scouts . The first quatrain speaks to the needs of the body ( food & shelter ) ; the second to the needs of the spirit ( peace ) ; the final quatrain is the meeting of the inner life ( memory ) with the physical world ( pavement grey ) . </P> <H2> Musical settings ( edit ) </H2> <P> A musical setting of this poem is featured in DUBLIN 1916 , An Irish Oratorio and YEATS SONGS , a song cycle , both composed by Richard B. Evans . ( published by Seacastle Music Company , 1995 ) . Muriel Herbert set the poem in 1928 . Seattle , WA band Fleet Foxes mentions the Isles of Innisfree in many other songs including ' The Shrine / An Argument ' , ' Isles ' and ' Bedouin Dress ' . American composer Ben Moore has also composed a setting of the poem . Another musical setting is featured in Branduardi canta Yeats ( published by Edizioni Musicali Musiza , 1986 ) , composed and played by Angelo Branduardi on translation of Luisa Zappa . Michael McGlynn of the Irish group An\u00fana arranged this as a choral piece : a `` recording '' of it is featured on An\u00fana 's album Invocation . Composer and pianist Ola Gjeilo set this text to music in a piece called `` The Lake Isle . '' Popular settings of the poem have been done by Judy Collins and the Dream Brothers . Australian musician Paul Kelly performs a version on his 2013 album `` Conversations with Ghosts '' . Shusha Guppy recorded an unaccompanied version on her album ' This is the Day ' ( United Artist Records , 1974 ) . ' The Lake Isle of Innisfree ' is part of the Songcylcle ' 5 Songs on Poems by W.B. Yeats ' composed by the Dutch composer Carolien Devilee . </P> <H2> In other media ( edit ) </H2> <Dl> <Dt> Television </Dt> </Dl> <P> In the finale episode of the fourth season of the Fox science - fiction drama television series Fringe entitled Brave New World ( Part 2 ) , Dr. William Bell ( Leonard Nimoy ) narrates the first stanza of the poem , alluding to his plans of collapsing the two universes into a new world where he plays God . </P> <P> Cinema </P> <P> In the film Million Dollar Baby , directed by Clint Eastwood , Frankie Dunn ( portrayed by Eastwood ) reads the first two quatrains to Margaret Fitzgerald ( Hilary Swank ) at the hospital after a fight where her neck has broken . </P> <P> In the climactic scene from the film Three And Out , Tommy recites the poem just before he gets hit by the train . </P> <P> John Ford 's Academy Award winning film The Quiet Man ( 1952 ) is set in Innisfree and clearly takes Yeat 's poem as one of its principal subtexts . </P> <P> Music </P> <P> In the song The Shrine / An Argument by Seattle indie folk band Fleet Foxes Innisfree is mentioned in the song 's final lyric : `` Carry me to Innisfree like pollen on the breeze '' . The band also mentions Innisfree in their song Bedouin Dress on the same album , saying frequently : `` One day at Innisfree , one day that 's mine there '' and `` Just to be at Innisfree again '' . </P> <P> In his LP Branduardi canta Yeats ( 1986 ) , Angelo Branduardi sings an italian version of this poem . </P> <P> The poem inspired Philip Gates 's The Lake Isle for oboe and piano . </P> <P> The Folk singer songwriter and actor Hamid Hamilton Camp Released a beautiful version called Innisfree on his 1964 album Paths of Victory on Electra records . </P> <P> Literature </P> <P> In his debut novel Ghostwritten the British author David Mitchell quotes the first two quatrains in the chapter `` London '' and the last in the chapter `` Clear Island . '' </P> <P> Essays Referred to in the final line of J.B. Priestley 's essay `` At Thurston 's '' , 1932 ; writing that watching a billiards match at Thurston 's Hall is `` as near to the Isle of Innisfree as we can get within a hundred miles of Leicester Square '' . </P> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ Kenner , Hugh . `` The Conquest of English '' .
