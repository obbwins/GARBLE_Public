An RFID chip ( also known as PIT tag ) next to a grain of rice . <P> A microchip implant is an identifying integrated circuit placed under the skin of an animal . The chip , about the size of a large grain of rice , uses passive RFID ( Radio Frequency Identification ) technology , and is also known as a PIT ( Passive Integrated Transponder ) tag . </P> <P> Externally attached microchips such as RFID ear tags are commonly used to identify farm and ranch animals , with the exception of horses . Some external microchips can be read with the same scanner used with implanted chips . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Uses and benefits </Li> <Li> 2 Usage </Li> <Li> 3 Components of a microchip </Li> <Li> 4 Implant location </Li> <Li> 5 Animal species </Li> <Li> 6 Worldwide use </Li> <Li> 7 Cross-compatibility and standards issues </Li> <Li> 8 Reported adverse reactions </Li> <Li> 9 See also </Li> <Li> 10 Notes </Li> <Li> 11 References </Li> <Li> 12 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Uses and benefits ( edit ) </H2> <P> Animal shelters , animal control officers and veterinarians routinely look for microchips to return lost pets quickly to their owners , avoiding expenses for housing , food , medical care , outplacing and euthanasia . Many shelters place chips in all outplaced animals . </P> <P> Microchips are also used by kennels , breeders , brokers , trainers , registries , rescue groups , humane societies , clinics , farms , stables , animal clubs and associations , researchers , and pet stores . </P> <P> Some pet doors can be programmed to be activated by the microchips of specific animals , allowing only certain animals to use the door . </P> <P> Some countries require microchips in imported animals to match vaccination records . Microchip tagging may also be required for CITES - regulated international trade in certain endangered animals : for example , Asian Arowana are tagged to limit import to captive - bred fish . Also , birds not banded who cross international borders as pets or for trade must be microchipped so that each bird is uniquely identifiable . </P> <H2> Usage ( edit ) </H2> Information about the implant is often imprinted on a collar tag worn by a pet <P> Microchips can be implanted by a veterinarian or at a shelter . After checking that the animal does not already have a chip , the vet or technician injects the chip with a syringe and records the chip 's unique ID . No anesthetic is required it is a simple procedure and causes little discomfort : the pain is minimal and short - lived . A test scan ensures correct operation . </P> <P> An enrollment form is completed with chip ID , owner contact information , pet name and description , shelter and / or veterinarian contact information , and an alternate emergency contact designated by the pet owner . Some shelters and vets designate themselves as the primary contact to remain informed about possible problems with the animals they place . The form is sent to a registry , who may be the chip manufacturer , distributor or an independent entity such as a pet recovery service . Some countries have a single official national database . For a fee , the registry typically provides 24 - hour , toll - free telephone service for the life of the pet . Some veterinarians leave registration to the owner , usually done online , but a chip without current contact information is essentially useless . </P> <P> The owner receives a registration certificate with the chip ID and recovery service contact information . The information can also be imprinted on a collar tag worn by the animal . Like an automobile title , the certificate serves as proof of ownership and is transferred with the animal when it is sold or traded ; an animal without a certificate could be stolen . </P> <P> Authorities and shelters examine strays for chips , providing the recovery service with the ID number , description and location so they may notify the owner or contact . If the pet is wearing the collar tag , the finder does not need a chip reader to contact the registry . An owner can also report a missing pet to the recovery service , as vets look for chips in new animals and check with the recovery service to see if it has been reported lost or stolen . </P> <P> Many veterinarians scan an animal 's chip on every visit to verify correct operation . Some use the chip ID as their database index and print it on receipts , test results , vaccination certifications and other records . </P> <P> Some veterinary tests and procedures require positive identification of the animal , and a microchip may be acceptable for this purpose as an alternative to a tattoo . </P> <H2> Components of a microchip ( edit ) </H2> <P> A microchip implant is a passive RFID device . Lacking an internal power source , it remains inert until it is powered by the scanner . </P> <P> Most implants contain three elements : a ' chip ' or integrated circuit ; a coil inductor , possibly with a ferrite core ; and a capacitor . The chip contains unique identification data and electronic circuits to encode that information . The coil acts as the secondary winding of a transformer , receiving power inductively coupled to it from the scanner . The coil and capacitor together form a resonant LC circuit tuned to the frequency of the scanner 's oscillating magnetic field to produce power for the chip . The chip then transmits its data back through the coil to the scanner . </P> Example of an RFID scanner used with animal microchip implants . <P> These components are encased in biocompatible soda lime or borosilicate glass and hermetically sealed . Barring rare complications , dogs and cats are unaffected by them . </P> <H2> Implant location ( edit ) </H2> <P> In dogs and cats , chips are usually inserted below the skin at the back of the neck between the shoulder blades on the dorsal midline . According to one reference , continental European pets get the implant in the left side of the neck . The chip can often be felt under the skin . Thin layers of connective tissue form around the implant and hold it in place . </P> <P> Horses are microchipped on the left side of the neck , halfway between the poll and withers and approximately one inch below the midline of the mane , into the nuchal ligament . </P> <P> Birds are implanted in their breast muscles . Proper restraint is necessary so the operation requires either two people ( an avian veterinarian and a veterinary technician ) or general anesthesia . </P> <P> Implanted microchips can distort magnetic resonance imaging ( MRIs ) , including those of the spinal cord . </P> <H2> Animal species ( edit ) </H2> Horse microchipping <P> Many animal species have been microchipped , including cockatiels and other parrots , horses , llamas , alpacas , goats , sheep , miniature pigs , rabbits , deer , ferrets , penguins , sharks , snakes , lizards , alligators , turtles , toads , frogs , rare fish , chimpanzees , mice , and prairie dogs -- even whales and elephants . The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service uses microchipping in its research of wild bison , black - footed ferrets , grizzly bears , elk , white - tailed deer , giant land tortoises and armadillos . </P> <H2> Worldwide use ( edit ) </H2> <P> Microchips are not yet universal , but they are legally required in some jurisdictions such as the state of New South Wales , Australia and the United Kingdom ( for dogs , since 6 April 2016 ) . </P> <P> Some countries , such as Japan , require ISO - compliant microchips or a compatible reader on imported dogs and cats . </P> <P> In New Zealand , all dogs first registered after 1 July 2006 must be microchipped . Farmers protested that farm dogs should be exempt , drawing a parallel to the Dog Tax War of 1898 . Farm dogs were exempted from microchipping in an amendment to the legislation passed in June 2006 . A National Animal Identification and Tracing scheme in New Zealand is currently being developed for tracking livestock . </P> <P> In April 2012 Northern Ireland became the first part of the United Kingdom to require microchipping of individually licensed dogs . Dog microchipping became mandatory in England on 6 April 2016 . </P> <P> In Israel , microchips in dogs are mandatory . </P> <P> Australia has a National Livestock Identification System . </P> <P> The United States uses the National Animal Identification System for farm and ranch animals other than dogs and cats . In most species except horses , an external eartag is typically used in lieu of an implant microchip . Eartags with microchips or simply stamped with a visible number can be used . Both use ISO 15 digit microchip numbers with the U.S. country code of 840 . </P> <H2> Cross-compatibility and standards issues ( edit ) </H2> <P> In most countries , pet ID chips adhere to an international standard to promote compatibility between chips and scanners . In the United States , however , three proprietary types of chips compete along with the international standard . Scanners distributed to United States shelters and veterinarians well into 2006 could each read at most three of the four types . Scanners with quad - read capability are now available and are increasingly considered required equipment . Older scanner models will be in use for some time , so United States pet owners must still choose between a chip with good coverage by existing scanners and one compatible with the international standard . The four types include : </P> <Ul> <Li> The ISO Conformant Full Duplex type has the greatest international acceptance . It is common in many countries including Europe ( since the late 1990s ) and Canada . It is one of two chip protocol types ( along with the `` Half Duplex '' type sometimes used in farm and ranch animals ) that conform to International Organization for Standardization standards ISO 11784 & 11785 . To support international / multivendor application , the 3 - digit country code can contain an assigned ISO country code or a manufacturer code from 900 to 998 plus its identifying serial number . In the United States , distribution of this type has been controversial . When 24PetWatch.com began distributing them in 2003 ( and more famously Banfield Pet Hospitals in 2004 ) many shelter scanners could n't read them . ( Some still ca n't ; asking local shelters about this is still a good idea . ) At least one Banfield - chipped pet was inadvertently euthanized . </Li> <Li> The Trovan Unique type is another pet chip protocol type in use since 1990 in pets in the United States . Patent problems forced the withdrawal of Trovan 's implanter device from United States distribution and they became uncommon in pets in the United States , although Trovan 's original registry database `` infopet.biz '' remained in operation . In early 2007 , the American Kennel Club 's chip registration service , AKC Companion Animal Recovery Corp , which had been the authorized registry for HomeAgain brand chips made by Destron / Digital Angel , began distributing Trovan chips with a different implanter . These chips are read by the Trovan , HomeAgain ( Destron Fearing ) , and Bayer ( Black Label ) readers . Despite multiple offers from Trovan to AVID to license the technology to read the Trovan chips , AVID continues to distribute readers that do not read Trovan or the ISO compliant chips . </Li> <Li> A third type sometimes known as FECAVA or Destron is available under various brand names . These include , in the United States , `` Avid Eurochip '' , the common current 24PetWatch chips , and the original ( and still popular ) style of HomeAgain chips . ( HomeAgain and 24Petwatch can now supply the true ISO chip instead on request . ) Chips of this type have 10 digit ( hexadecimal ) chip numbers . This `` FECAVA '' type is readable on a wide variety of scanners in the United States and has been less controversial , although its level of adherence to the ISO standards is sometimes exaggerated in some descriptions . The ISO standard has an annex ( appendix ) recommending that three older chip types be supported by scanners , including a 35 - bit `` FECAVA '' / `` Destron '' type . The common Eurochip / HomeAgain chips do n't agree perfectly with the annex description , although the differences are sometimes considered minor . But the ISO standard also makes it clear that only its 64 - bit `` full - duplex '' and `` half - duplex '' types are `` conformant '' ; even chips ( e.g. , the Trovan Unique ) that match one of the Annex descriptions are not . More visibly , FECAVA can not support the ISO standard 's required country / manufacturer codes . They may be accepted by authorities in many countries where ISO - standard chips are the norm , but not by those requiring literal ISO conformance . </Li> <Li> Finally , there 's the AVID brand Friendchip type , which is peculiar due to its encryption characteristics . Cryptographic features are not necessarily unwelcome ; few pet rescuers or humane societies would object to a design that outputs an ID number `` in the clear '' for anyone to read , along with authentication features for detection of counterfeit chips , but the authentication in `` Friendchips '' has been found lacking and rather easy to spoof to the AVID scanner . Although no authentication encryption is involved , obfuscation requires proprietary information to convert transmitted chip data to its original label ID code . Well into 2006 , scanners containing the proprietary decryption were provided to the United States market only by AVID and Destron / Digital Angel ; Destron / Digital Angel put the decryption feature in some , but not all , of its scanners , possibly as early as 1996 . ( For years , its scanners distributed to shelters through HomeAgain usually had full decryption , while many sold to veterinarians would only state that an AVID chip had been found . ) Well into 2006 , both were resisting calls from consumers and welfare group officials to bring scanners to the United States shelter community combining AVID decryption capability with the ability to read ISO - compliant chips . Some complained that AVID itself had long marketed combination pet scanners compatible with all common pet chips except possibly Trovan outside the United States . By keeping them out of the United States , it could be considered partly culpable in the missed - ISO chips problem others blamed on Banfield . In 2006 , the European manufacturer Datamars , a supplier of ISO chips used by Banfield and others , gained access to the decryption secrets and began supplying scanners with them to United States customers . This `` Black Label '' scanner was the first four - standard full - multi pet scanner in the United States market . Later in 2006 , Digital Angel announced that it would supply a full - multi scanner in the United States . In 2008 AVID announced a `` breakthrough '' scanner , although as of October 2010 AVID 's is still so uncommon that it 's unclear whether it supports the Trovan chip . Trovan also acquired the decryption technology in 2006 or earlier , and now provides it in scanners distributed in the United States by AKC - CAR . ( Some are quad - read , but others lack full ISO support . ) </Li> </Ul> <P> Numerous references in print state that the incompatibilities between different chip types are a matter of `` frequency '' . One may find claims that early ISO adopters in the United States endangered their customers ' pets by giving them ISO chips that work at a `` different frequency '' from the local shelter 's scanner , or that the United States government considered forcing an incompatible frequency change . These claims were little challenged by manufacturers and distributors of ISO chips , although later evidence suggests the claims were disinformation . In fact , all chips operate at the scanner 's frequency . Although ISO chips are optimized for 134.2 kHz , in practice they are readable at 125 kHz and the `` 125 kHz '' chips are readable at 134.2 kHz . Confirmation comes from government filings that indicate the supposed `` multi-frequency '' scanners now commonly available are really single - frequency scanners operating at 125 , 134.2 or 128 kHz . In particular , the United States HomeAgain scanner did n't change excitation frequency when ISO - read capability was added ; it 's still a single frequency , 125 kHz scanner . </P> <Table> <Tr> <Th> </Th> <Th_colspan=\"4\"> Expected results for chip type ( OK = Good read NR = No read DO = Detect Only with no number given ) </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Scanner to test </Th> <Th> ISO Conformant Full Duplex chip </Th> <Th> AVID Encrypted `` FriendChip '' </Th> <Th> Original U.S. HomeAgain , AVID Eurochip , or FECAVA </Th> <Th> `` Trovan Unique '' and current AKC CAR chips </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Minimal ISO Conformant Scanner ( also must read HALF Duplex chips common in livestock ear tags ) </Th> <Td> OK </Td> <Td> NR </Td> <Td> NR </Td> <Td> NR </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> AVID Basic U.S. Scanner </Th> <Td> NR </Td> <Td> OK </Td> <Td> NR </Td> <Td> NR </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> AVID Deluxe U.S. Scanner </Th> <Td> NR </Td> <Td> OK </Td> <Td> OK </Td> <Td> NR </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> AVID Universal Scanner sold outside U.S. </Th> <Td> OK </Td> <Td> OK </Td> <Td> OK </Td> <Td> NR Assumed </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> AVID MiniTracker Pro Scanner announced August 2008 </Th> <Td> OK </Td> <Td> OK </Td> <Td> OK </Td> <Td> NR according to some ( Few have seen one . ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Various vintages of U.S. HomeAgain `` Universal '' Shelter Scanners by Destron / Digital Angel Corp . </Th> <Td> NR , DO , or OK </Td> <Td> OK </Td> <Td> OK </Td> <Td> Possibly all OK </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Typical Destron / Digital Angel Corp .

The study predates the most recent scanner models , however . ) </P> <H2> Reported adverse reactions ( edit ) </H2> <P> RFID chips are used in animal research , and at least three studies conducted since the 1990s have reported tumors at the site of implantation in laboratory mice and rats . Noted veterinary associations responded with continued support for the procedure as reasonably safe for cats and dogs , pointing to rates of serious complications on the order of one in a million in the U.K. , which has a system for tracking such adverse reactions and has chipped over 3.7 million pet dogs . A recent study found no safety concerns for microchipped animals with RFID chips undergoing MRI at one Tesla magnetic field strength . In 2011 a microchip - associated fibrosarcoma was reported found in the neck of a 9 - year old , neutered - male cat . Histological examination was consistent with postinjection sarcoma , but all prior vaccinations occurred in the hindlegs . </P> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Microchip implant ( human ) </Li> <Li> PositiveID </Li> <Li> Proximity card </Li> <Li> Pet recovery service </Li> <Li> Remote - controlled animal </Li> </Ul> <H2> Notes ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ For display , typically the three country / manufacturer code digits are followed by twelve digits of serial number to make a 15 - digit numeric string . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Curiously , an actual matching descriptive specification from the Federation of European Companion Animal Veterinary Associations , or one from Destron Corporation , remains illusive . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ The differences are obvious and easily surmounted by someone trying to make a scanner for a FECAVA chip specimen , so the Annex is still quite useful . ( The actual FECAVA frequency - modulated signals are inverted ( backwards ) from the Annex specification . ) </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ This is found in clauses 2 and 6 of ISO 11785 ; the two actual conformant 64 - bit types are described in clauses 6.1 and 6.2 . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Few of the petitioners bothered to ask AVID to add Trovan - chip compatibility at that time , as these chips would remain uncommon and obscure until 2007 in the U.S. </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ In addition to its current scanners with full support for ISO full duplex chips , and maybe ten years production of earlier scanners with no ISO support , Destron / Digital Angel Corp. is also reported to have made in - between models circa 2006 , one that gives a detection indication , but no number for ISO chips , and one model that gives either simple detection or full number readout , depending perhaps on the chip 's manufacturer or some other factor . These models may be hard to discern without many specimen chips ; upgrades may be available , especially to current customer partners of HomeAgain . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ A mention of a chip type called `` AVID Travelchip '' has been removed from this heading . It appears that `` Travelchip '' was actually a trademark not of AVID itself but of a chip distributor , which used it as a blanket term for several different chip types sold in value - added kits - firstly AVID Eurochips , later HomeAgain types both regular and ISO . </Li> </Ol> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ Lomas , Natasha ( 28 June 2017 ) . `` Now you can quantify your cat 's comings and goings too '' .
