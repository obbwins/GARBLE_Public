It is coordinated by the Multi-State Lottery Association ( MUSL ) , a nonprofit organization formed by an agreement with US lotteries . Powerball 's minimum advertised jackpot is $40 million ( annuity ) ; Powerball 's annuity is paid in 30 graduated installments or winners may choose a lump sum payment instead . One lump sum payment will be less than the total of the 30 annual payments because of the time value of money . </P> <P> Drawings for Powerball are held every Wednesday and Saturday evening at 10 : 59 p.m. Eastern Time . Since October 7 , 2015 , the game has used a 5 / 69 ( white balls ) + 1 / 26 ( Powerballs ) matrix from which winning numbers are chosen , resulting in odds of 1 in 292,201,338 of winning a jackpot per play . Each play costs $2 , or $3 with the Power Play option . ( Originally , Powerball plays cost $1 ; when PowerPlay began , such games were $2 . ) The official cutoff for ticket sales is 10 : 00 p.m. Eastern Time ; some lotteries cut off sales earlier . The drawings are usually held at the Florida Lottery 's studio in Tallahassee . </P> <P> On January 13 , 2016 , Powerball produced the largest lottery jackpot in history ; the $1.586 billion jackpot was split by three tickets sold in Chino Hills , California , in Munford , Tennessee , and in Melbourne Beach , Florida . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Powerball members <Ul> <Li> 1.1 Mega Millions and Powerball </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 History <Ul> <Li> 2.1 1988 precursor : Lotto * America </Li> <Li> 2.2 Powerball begins </Li> <Li> 2.3 2009 : Florida became host to drawings </Li> <Li> 2.4 2010 cross-sell expansion </Li> <Li> 2.5 2012 format change </Li> <Li> 2.6 2015 format change </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Playing the game <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Basic game </Li> <Li> 3.2 Power Play </Li> <Li> 3.3 Prizes and odds </Li> <Li> 3.4 Jackpot accumulation and payment options </Li> <Li> 3.5 Claiming prizes </Li> <Li> 3.6 Secondary prizes </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Notable wins </Li> <Li> 5 Fortune cookie payout </Li> <Li> 6 Computers and slot machines </Li> <Li> 7 See also </Li> <Li> 8 References </Li> <Li> 9 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Powerball members ( edit ) </H2> U.S. lotteries .

In 2013 , Wyoming became the 44th state to establish a lottery ; the next year , it began , initially offering both Mega Millions and Powerball . </P> <H2> History ( edit ) </H2> <H3> 1988 precursor : Lotto * America ( edit ) </H3> <P> Powerball 's predecessor began in 1988 ; the multi-state game was known as Lotto * America . The game , and name , were changed to Powerball on April 19 , 1992 ; its first drawing was held April 22 . </P> <H3> Powerball begins ( edit ) </H3> <P> When it was launched in 1992 Powerball became the first game to use two drums . Using two drums to draw numbers from offers more manipulation by simultaneously allowing high jackpot odds , numerous prize levels and low overall odds of winning ( as explained later , a ticket can win by matching only one number ) . The two - drum concept was suggested by Steve Caputo of the Oregon Lottery . The two - drum concept has since been used by The Big Game ( now Mega Millions ) in the US , Australia 's Powerball , Thunderball in the UK , Eurojackpot and EuroMillions ( unlike most two - drum games , Euromillions selects two numbers called `` Lucky Stars '' from the 2nd drum ; jackpot winners must make a total of seven matches ) . </P> <P> Through 2008 , Powerball drawings usually were held at Screenscape Studios in West Des Moines , Iowa . The drawings ' host was longtime Iowa radio personality Mike Pace , who had hosted MUSL drawings since Lotto * America began in 1988 . In 1996 , Powerball went `` on the road '' for the first time , holding five remote drawings at the Summer Olympics in Atlanta . A few weeks later , Georgia became the only jurisdiction to leave Powerball ( Maine , which joined MUSL in 1990 , left when Powerball began ) . In August 1996 , Georgia joined the then - new The Big Game , then the other major U.S. lottery group . It planned to sell tickets for both games for the rest of 1996 ; but within days Georgia was removed from MUSL , not to return until the 2010 cross-sell expansion . </P> <P> On November 2 , 1997 , the annuity was changed from 20 to 25 yearly payments ; the cash option was added . The annuity comprises 30 graduated payments , increasing 5 % annually . </P> <P> In 1998 , Florida was given permission by its government to participate in a multi-state game . It was set to offer Powerball ; but in early 1999 , new governor Jeb Bush prevented Florida from joining since he believed Powerball would hurt the existing Florida Lottery games . In 2008 , Governor Charlie Crist finally allowed Florida to join MUSL , on Jan 4 , 2009 . </P> <P> On March 7 , 2001 , an optional multiplier ( called Power Play ) was added , allowing players to multiply non-jackpot winnings by up to five by paying an extra $1 per game . A wheel was introduced to select the Power Play multiplier for each drawing ( the next year , the 1x was removed from the Power Play wheel . ) </P> <H3> 2009 : Florida became host to drawings ( edit ) </H3> <P> With the start of Powerball sales in Florida on January 4 , 2009 ( with its first drawing on January 7 ) , the matrices changed to 5 / 59 + 1 / 39 ( adding four white ball numbers and dropping three red balls ) . This changed the jackpot probability from 1 : 146 million to 1 : 195 million ; the overall probability became 1 : 35 . </P> <P> Based on statistical projections , the average jackpot win increased from $95 million to $141 million . Over 3.5 million additional prizes were expected to be won yearly due to the change in probability . The starting jackpot increased to $20 million , with minimum rollovers of $5 million . The jackpot contribution increased from 30.3 % to 32.5 % of total sales . The Power Play option was modified ; second prize , usually $200,000 , was given an automatic 5x multiplier , making the 5 + 0 prize $1 million cash . The bonus second prize if the jackpot exceeded its previous record by $25 million , triggered only twice , was eliminated with the 2012 format change . </P> <P> The conditions for Florida joining Powerball included a move of the live drawings from Iowa to Universal Studios in Orlando . The three hosts rotating announcing duties from Universal Studios were Tracy Wiu , Elizabeth Hart and Scott Adams ( MUSL headquarters remained in Iowa , where its other draws are held ) . The wheel that was used to determine the Power Play multiplier was retired when the drawings moved to Florida ; a random number generator ( RNG ) was used until the 2012 format change . </P> <P> Arkansas became the 33rd MUSL member on October 31 , 2009 , the last to join before the 2010 cross-sell expansion . The Ohio Lottery added Powerball on April 16 , 2010 ; it joined Mega Millions ( along with New York ) years earlier , when The Big Game added Mega Millions to its name . </P> <H3> 2010 cross-sell expansion ( edit ) </H3> <P> In March 2009 , it was reported that New Jersey , already a Mega Millions member , sought permission to join Powerball . Shortly after , discussions were revealed about allowing each US lottery to offer both games . On Oct 13 , the Mega Millions consortium and MUSL reached an agreement in principle to cross-sell Mega Millions and Powerball . In Nov , MUSL signed an agreement to start streaming Powerball drawings online . </P> <P> On Jan 31 , 2010 , the date of the cross-sell expansion , Mega Millions and MUSL each added lotteries ; eight Powerball members added Mega Millions by May . The Montana Lottery joined Mega Millions on March 1 . Nebraska added Mega Millions on March 20 ; Oregon followed on March 28 ; Arizona joined Mega Millions on April 18 ; Maine added Mega Millions on May 9 ; Colorado and South Dakota joined Mega Millions on May 16 . The U.S. Virgin Islands joined Mega Millions in Oct 2010 . </P> <P> Before the agreement , the only places that sold both Mega Millions and Powerball tickets were retailers straddling a border ; one retailer on the Sharon , Pennsylvania / Masury , Ohio border sold both Mega Millions ( via the Ohio Lottery ) and Powerball ( Pennsylvania ) before the agreement and continued to be the only retailer to sell tickets for both lotteries . </P> <P> Illinois joining Powerball on the expansion date , it became the second multi-jurisdictional lottery game ( after Mega Millions , which Illinois already participated in ) whose drawings were carried nationally . Both games ' drawings were simulcast via Chicago cable superstation WGN - TV through its national WGN America feed . WGN - TV aired Illinois Lottery drawings nationally from 1992 to 2015 after acquiring broadcast rights from Chicago 's Fox owned - and - operated station WFLD in 1988 , which took the rights from WGN - TV in 1987 . Powerball drawings were aired on WGN - TV and WGN America on Wednesday and Saturday immediately following the station 's 9pm ( Central Time ) newscast with the Mega Millions drawings being aired Tue and Fri evenings after the newscast . WGN served as a default carrier of Mega Millions or Powerball where no local television station carries either multi-jurisdictional lottery 's drawings . </P> <P> On March 13 , 2010 , New Jersey became the first previous Mega Millions - only member ( just before the cross-selling expansion ) to produce a jackpot - winning Powerball ticket . It was worth over $211 million in annuity payments ; it was sold in Morris Plains . On May 28 , 2010 , North Carolina became the first previous MUSL member ( just before the cross-selling expansion ) to produce a jackpot - winning Mega Millions ticket ; that jackpot was $12 million ( annuity ) . </P> <P> On June 2 , 2010 , Ohio won a Powerball jackpot ; it became the first lottery selling either Mega Millions or Powerball ( when 2010 began ) to provide a jackpot - winning ticket for its newer game . The ticket was worth a $261 million annuity ; it was sold in Sunbury . Ohio 's second Powerball jackpot - winning ticket , sold for the June 23 , 2010 drawing , was part of another first ; since Montana also provided a jackpot winner for that drawing , it was the first time a jackpot was shared through lotteries which sold competing games before the cross-selling expansion , as Montana sold only Powerball before the expansion date . </P> <H3> 2012 format change ( edit ) </H3> <P> On January 15 , 2012 , the price of each basic Powerball play doubled to $2 , while PowerPlay games became $3 ; the minimum jackpot doubled to $40 million . A non-jackpot play matching the five white balls won $1 million . The red balls decreased from 39 to 35 . The drawings were moved from Universal Studios Orlando to the Florida Lottery 's studios in Tallahassee . Sam Arlen served as host , with Alexa Fuentes substituting . </P> <P> These changes were made to increase the frequency of nine - figure jackpots ; a Powerball spokesperson believed a $500 million jackpot was feasible ( it became a reality within the year , ) and that the 1st $1 billion jackpot in US history would occur by 2012 Less than three months after the Powerball changes , Mega Millions ' jackpot reached $656,000,000 despite remaining a $1 - per - play game . The random Power Play multiplier was retired for a set , fixed dollar amount payout . The $25 million rollover `` cap '' ( creating larger 5 + 0 prizes ) was eliminated . </P> <P> California joined on April 8 , 2013 ; it has never offered the Power Play option , as all payouts in California Lottery drawing games , by law , are parimutuel . Mega Millions , which became available in California in 2005 , offers its Megaplier in its other 45 jurisdictions . </P> <P> On January 22 , 2014 , the variable Power Play option returned ( 2x - 5x ) for multiplying non-jackpot prizes . </P> <P> In October 2014 , Puerto Rico joined Powerball ; the first mainly Spanish - speaking jurisdiction offering the game ; as of 2016 it had not joined Mega Millions . </P> <H3> 2015 format change ( edit ) </H3> <P> On Oct 4 , 2015 , the Powerball format changed again ; the white - ball pool increased from 59 to 69 while the Powerball pool decreased from 35 to 26 . While this improved the chance of winning any prize to 1 in 24 , it also lengthened the jackpot odds to 1 in 292,201,338 . The 4 + 1 prize became $50,000 ; the 10x PowerPlay became available in drawings with a jackpot of under $150 million . Three months later , the format produced a $1.5 billion jackpot , double the previous record , after 20 consecutive rollovers . </P> <H2> Playing the game ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Basic game ( edit ) </H3> <P> The minimum Powerball bet is $2 . In each game , players select five numbers from a set of 69 white balls and one number from 26 red Powerballs ; the red ball number can be the same as one of the white balls . The drawing order of the five white balls is irrelevant ; all tickets show the white ball numbers in ascending order . Players can not use the drawn Powerball to match two of their white numbers , or vice versa . Players can select their own numbers , or have the terminal pseudorandomly select the numbers ( called `` quick pick '' , `` easy pick '' , etc . ) . </P> <P> In each drawing , winning numbers are selected using two ball machines : one containing the white balls and the other containing the red Powerballs . Five white balls are drawn from the first machine and the red ball from the second machine . Games matching at least three white balls or the red Powerball win . </P> <P> Two identical machines are used for each drawing , randomly selected from four sets . The model of machine used is the Halogen , manufactured by Smartplay International of Edgewater Park , New Jersey . There are eight ball sets ( four of each color ) ; one set of each color is randomly selected before a drawing . The balls are mixed by a turntable at the bottom of the machine that propels the balls around the chamber . When the machine selects a ball , the turntable slows to catch it , sends it up the shaft , and then down the rail to the display . </P> <P> The double matrixes and probabilities in the game 's history : </P> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Starting date </Th> <Th> Pick 5 of </Th> <Th> Pick 1 of </Th> <Th> Jackpot chance </Th> <Th> Power Play multipliers </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> April 22 , 1992 </Td> <Td> 45 </Td> <Td> 45 </Td> <Td> 1 : 54,979,154 </Td> <Td> none \u2020 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> November 5 , 1997 </Td> <Td> 49 </Td> <Td> 42 </Td> <Td> 1 : 80,089,127 </Td> <Td> none \u2020 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> March 7 , 2001 </Td> <Td> 49 </Td> <Td> 42 </Td> <Td> 1 : 80,089,127 </Td> <Td> 1 \u00d7 - 5 \u00d7 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> October 9 , 2002 </Td> <Td> 53 </Td> <Td> 42 </Td> <Td> 1 : 120,526,769 </Td> <Td> 2 \u00d7 - 5 \u00d7 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> August 28 , 2005 </Td> <Td> 55 </Td> <Td> 42 </Td> <Td> 1 : 146,107,961 </Td> <Td> 2 \u00d7 - 5 \u00d7 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> January 7 , 2009 </Td> <Td> 59 </Td> <Td> 39 </Td> <Td> 1 : 195,249,054 </Td> <Td> 2 \u00d7 - 5 \u00d7 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> January 15 , 2012 </Td> <Td> 59 </Td> <Td> 35 </Td> <Td> 1 : 175,223,510 </Td> <Td> none </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> January 19 , 2014 </Td> <Td> 59 </Td> <Td> 35 </Td> <Td> 1 : 175,223,510 </Td> <Td> 2 \u00d7 - 5 \u00d7 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> October 7 , 2015 </Td> <Td> 69 </Td> <Td> 26 </Td> <Td> 1 : 292,201,338 </Td> <Td> 2 \u00d7 - 5 \u00d7 ; 10 \u00d7 \u2021 </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> \u2020 Power Play was introduced in 2001 . \u2021 10 \u00d7 available if jackpot is under $150 million . </P> <P> While Mega Millions and Powerball each have similar jackpot odds despite having a different double matrix ( Mega Millions is 5 / 75 + 1 / 15 ) , since Powerball is $2 per play , it now takes $584,402,676 ( not counting Power Play side bets ) on average to produce a jackpot - winning ticket . </P> <H3> Power Play ( edit ) </H3> <P> For an additional $1 per game , a player may activate the Power Play option . Activating it multiplies lower - tier winnings ( base prize $50,000 or less ) by up to 5 , or 10 when the jackpot is under $150 million . Power Play is drawn separate from the 6 numbers . The 5 + 0 prize is automatically doubled to $2 million if Power Play is activated . </P> <P> The dilemma for players is whether to maximize the chance at the jackpot or increase lower - tier winnings . If a player selects a fixed amount of money to spend on tickets at a certain time , the player will give up one guess of the winning set of numbers every two times this player activates Power Play in respect of one of the purchased tickets . </P> <P> Power Play , when it began in 2001 , was drawn with a special wheel . In 2006 and 2007 , MUSL replaced one of the 5 \u00d7 spaces on the Power Play wheel with a 10 \u00d7 . During each month - long promotion , MUSL guaranteed that there would be at least one drawing with a 10 \u00d7 multiplier . The promotion returned in 2008 ; the ball landed in the 10 \u00d7 space twice . After being absent in 2009 , the 10 \u00d7 multiplier returned in May 2010 ( after the Power Play drawing was changed to RNG . ) The promotion was extended for the only time , as the 10 \u00d7 multiplier was not drawn until June 12 . The second prize 5 \u00d7 guarantee continued ; the 10 \u00d7 applied to all non-jackpot prizes , as in previous promotions . </P> <P> Power Play \u2032 s success has led to similar multipliers in other games , most notably Megaplier , available through all Mega Millions members except California . The 2012 Powerball changes resulted in all eight lower - tier levels having `` fixed '' Power Play prizes . </P> <P> On Jan 19 , 2014 , PowerPlay was modified ; it used 30 balls with the following distribution : </P> <Ul> <Li> 2x ( 15 ) </Li> <Li> 3x ( 9 ) </Li> <Li> 4x / 5x : 3 each </Li> </Ul> <P> On Oct 4 , 2015 , PowerPlay changed again , using 42 or 43 \u2020 balls as follows : </P> <Ul> <Li> 2x ( 24 ) </Li> <Li> 3x ( 13 ) </Li> <Li> 4x ( 3 ) </Li> <Li> 5x ( 2 ) </Li> <Li> 10x ( 1 ) \u2020 </Li> </Ul> <P> \u2020 10x available when jackpot is under $150 million . </P> <H3> Prizes and odds ( edit ) </H3> <P> Payouts as of October 7 , 2015 : </P> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Matches </Th> <Th> Prize </Th> <Th> Power Play 2x ( 1 in 1.75 ) </Th> <Th> Power Play 3x ( 1 in 3.23 ) </Th> <Th> Power Play 4x ( 1 in 14 ) </Th> <Th> Power Play 5x ( 1 in 21 ) </Th> <Th> Odds of winning </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> PB only ( 0 + 1 ) </Td> <Td> $4 </Td> <Td> $8 </Td> <Td> $12 </Td> <Td> $16 </Td> <Td> $20 </Td> <Td> 1 in 38.32 \u00a7 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1 number plus PB ( 1 + 1 ) </Td> <Td> $4 </Td> <Td> $8 </Td> <Td> $12 </Td> <Td> $16 </Td> <Td> $20 </Td> <Td> 1 in 91.98 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 2 + 1 </Td> <Td> $7 </Td> <Td> $14 </Td> <Td> $21 </Td> <Td> $28 </Td> <Td> $35 </Td> <Td> 1 in 701.33 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 3 + 0 </Td> <Td> $7 </Td> <Td> $14 </Td> <Td> $21 </Td> <Td> $28 </Td> <Td> $35 </Td> <Td> 1 in 579.76 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 3 + 1 </Td> <Td> $100 </Td> <Td> $200 </Td> <Td> $300 </Td> <Td> $400 </Td> <Td> $500 </Td> <Td> 1 in 14,494.11 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 4 + 0 </Td> <Td> $100 </Td> <Td> $200 </Td> <Td> $300 </Td> <Td> $400 </Td> <Td> $500 </Td> <Td> 1 in 36,525.17 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 4 + 1 </Td> <Td> $50,000 </Td> <Td> $100,000 </Td> <Td> $150,000 </Td> <Td> $200,000 </Td> <Td> $250,000 </Td> <Td> 1 in 913,129.18 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 5 + 0 </Td> <Td> $1,000,000 </Td> <Td_colspan=\"4\"> $2,000,000 </Td> <Td> 1 in 11,688,053.52 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 5 + 1 </Td> <Td_colspan=\"5\"> Jackpot </Td> <Td> 1 in 292,201,338 </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> Overall odds of winning a prize are 1 in 24.87 . </P> <P> Former prizes / odds ( January 19 , 2014 -- October 3 , 2015 ) : </P> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Matches </Th> <Th> Prize </Th> <Th> Power Play 2x ( 1 in 2 ) </Th> <Th> Power Play 3x ( 1 in 3 1 / 3 ) </Th> <Th> Power Play 4x ( 1 in 10 ) </Th> <Th> Power Play 5x ( 1 in 10 ) </Th> <Th> Odds of winning </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> PB only </Td> <Td> $4 </Td> <Td> $8 </Td> <Td> $12 </Td> <Td> $16 </Td> <Td> $20 </Td> <Td> 1 in 55.41 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1 number plus PB </Td> <Td> $4 </Td> <Td> $8 </Td> <Td> $12 </Td> <Td> $16 </Td> <Td> $20 </Td> <Td> 1 in 110.81 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 2 numbers plus PB </Td> <Td> $7 </Td> <Td> $14 </Td> <Td> $21 </Td> <Td> $28 </Td> <Td> $35 </Td> <Td> 1 in 706.43 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 3 numbers ; no PB </Td> <Td> $7 </Td> <Td> $14 </Td> <Td> $21 </Td> <Td> $28 </Td> <Td> $35 </Td> <Td> 1 in 360.14 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 3 numbers plus PB </Td> <Td> $100 </Td> <Td> $200 </Td> <Td> $300 </Td> <Td> $400 </Td> <Td> $500 </Td> <Td> 1 in 12,244.83 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 4 numbers ; no PB </Td> <Td> $100 </Td> <Td> $200 </Td> <Td> $300 </Td> <Td> $400 </Td> <Td> $500 </Td> <Td> 1 in 19,087.53 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 4 numbers plus PB </Td> <Td> $10,000 </Td> <Td> $20,000 </Td> <Td> $30,000 </Td> <Td> $40,000 </Td> <Td> $50,000 </Td> <Td> 1 in 648,975.96 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 5 numbers ; no PB </Td> <Td> $1,000,000 </Td> <Td_colspan=\"4\"> $2,000,000 </Td> <Td> 1 in 5,153,632.65 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 5 numbers plus PB </Td> <Td_colspan=\"5\"> Jackpot </Td> <Td> 1 in 175,223,510.00 </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> Overall odds of winning were 1 in 31.85 . </P> <Ol> <Li> ^ Jump up to : California 's prize amounts are always parimutuel because its state penal code distinguishes between a `` lottery '' which can not be broken and a `` banked game '' whose bank theoretically could be broken . Only a `` lottery '' was authorized by the state Lottery Act . Therefore , Power Play is not offered in California . </Li> <Li> ^ Jump up to : $2,000,000 fixed for match 5 + 0 with Power Play as of 2012 format change . </Li> <Li> ^ Jump up to : Power Play multipliers do not apply to jackpot . Jackpot is split among multiple winners . </Li> </Ol> <P> \u00a7 Odds of winning 0 + 1 prize are 1 : 38.32 instead of 1 : 26 as there is the possibility of also matching at least one white ball . </P> <P> All non-jackpot prizes are fixed amounts ( except in California ) ; they may be reduced and paid on a parimutuel basis , with each member paying differing amounts for the same prize tier , if the liability exceeds the funds in the prize pool for any game member . </P> <H3> Jackpot accumulation and payment options ( edit ) </H3> <P> Jackpot winners have the option of receiving their prize in cash ( in two installments ; one from the winning jurisdiction , then the combined funds from the other members ) or as a graduated annuity paid in 30 yearly installments . Each annuity payment is 5 % higher than in the previous year to adjust for inflation . </P> <P> The advertised estimated jackpot represents the total payments that would be paid to jackpot winner ( s ) should they accept the annuity option . This estimate is based on the funds accumulated in the jackpot pool rolled over from prior drawings , expected sales for the next drawing , and market interest rates for the securities that would be used to fund the annuity . The estimated jackpot usually is 32.5 % of the ( non-Power Play ) revenue of each base ( $1 ) play , submitted by game members to accumulate into a prize pool to fund the jackpot . If the jackpot is not won in a particular drawing , the prize pool carries over to the next drawing , accumulating until there is a jackpot winner . This prize pool is the cash that is paid to a jackpot winner if they choose cash . If the winner chooses the annuity , current market rates are used to calculate the graduated payment schedule and the initial installment is paid . The remaining funds in the prize pool are invested to generate the income required to fund the remaining installments . If there are multiple jackpot winners for a drawing , the jackpot prize pool is divided equally for all such plays . </P> <P> MUSL and its members accept all investment risk and are contractually obligated and liable to the winner to make all scheduled payments to annuity winners . If a jackpot ticket is not claimed , the funds in the prize pool are returned to members in proportion to the amount they contributed to the prize pool . The members have different rules regulating how unclaimed funds are used . </P> <P> When the Powerball jackpot is won , the next jackpot is guaranteed to be $40 million ( annuity ) . If a jackpot is not won , the minimum rollover is $10 million . The cash in the jackpot pool is guaranteed to be the current value of the annuity . If revenue from ticket sales falls below expectations , game members must contribute additional funds to the jackpot pool to cover the shortage ; the most likely scenario where this can occur is if the jackpot is won in consecutive drawings . </P> <H3> Claiming prizes ( edit ) </H3> <P> A winning ticket must be claimed in the jurisdiction in which it was purchased , regardless of residence . The minimum age to play Powerball is 18 , except in Nebraska ( 19 ) ; and Arizona , Iowa , and Louisiana ( 21 ) . </P> <P> Generally , Powerball players do not have to choose cash or annuity unless they win a jackpot ( then they usually have 60 days to choose . ) Exceptions include Florida and Missouri ; the 60 - day `` clock '' starts with the drawing , so a jackpot winner who wishes to take the cash option needs to make immediate plans to claim their prize . New Jersey and Texas require the cash / annuity choice to be made when playing ; in New Jersey , an annuity ticket can be changed to cash after winning , while in Texas , the choice is binding ( when the cash option was introduced in 1997 , all Powerball players had to make the choice when playing . This regulation was phased out by 1999 . ) All Powerball prizes must be claimed within a period ranging from 90 days to a year , depending on where the ticket was bought . </P> <P> Powerball winnings in California and Pennsylvania are subject to Federal income tax only . There is no state income tax in Florida , South Dakota , Texas , Washington and Wyoming , and only on interest and dividends in Tennessee and New Hampshire . Winnings from tickets purchased outside of one 's home state may be subject to the income tax laws of both states ( with possible credit based on the two jurisdictions . ) </P> <H3> Secondary prizes ( edit ) </H3> <P> Unlike the jackpot pool , other prizes are the responsibility and liability of each participating lottery . All revenue for Powerball ticket sales not used for jackpots is retained by each member ; none of this revenue is shared with other lotteries . Members are liable only for the payment of secondary prizes sold there . </P> <P> Since the secondary prizes are defined in fixed amounts ( except in California ) , if the liability for a given prize level exceed the funds in the prize pool for that level the amount of the prize may be reduced and the prize pool be distributed on a parimutuel basis and result in a prize lower than the fixed amounts given in the prize tables . Because the secondary prize pools are calculated independently , it is possible lower - tier prizes will differ among the game members . </P> <H2> Notable wins ( edit ) </H2> Main article : Lottery jackpot records \u00a7 United States <P> Because the quoted jackpot amount is an annuity of 30 graduated annual payments , its cash value relative to the annuity fluctuates . The actual ratio depends on projected interest rates and other factors . MUSL starts with the cash value , built from a percentage of sales , and then calculates the advertised jackpot amount from that value , based on the average costs of the three best securities bids . </P> <P> On August 23 , 2017 , the owner of a Powerball ticket sold in Chicopee , Massachusetts won more than $750 million , one of the largest prizes in the lottery 's history . </P> <P> On January 13 , 2016 , the world 's largest lottery jackpot , an annuity of approximately $1.586 billion , was split among three Powerball tickets in Chino Hills , California , Melbourne Beach , Florida and Munford , Tennessee , each worth $528.8 million . Since there is no income tax in Florida or Tennessee ( and California does not tax lottery winnings ) , the cash option after Federal withholdings is $187.2 million each . </P> <P> On May 18 , 2013 , the world 's largest one - ticket jackpot , an annuity of approximately $590.5 million ( $607 million today ) , was won by a Powerball ticket sold in Zephyrhills , Florida . On June 5 , Florida Lottery officials announced the winner : Gloria C. MacKenzie , 84 , who purchased the `` quick pick '' ticket at a Publix supermarket . MacKenzie chose the cash option of approximately $370.8 million , before Federal withholding ; Florida does not have a state income tax . </P> <P> Other winners in excess of $250 million : On December 25 , 2002 , Jack Whittaker , president of a construction firm in Putnam County , West Virginia , won $314.9 million ( $419 million today ) , then a new record for a single ticket in an American lottery . Whittaker chose the cash option of $170 million , receiving approximately $83 million after West Virginia and Federal withholdings . </P> <P> On October 19 , 2005 , the West family of Jacksonville , Oregon won $340 million ( $417 million today ) . The Wests chose the cash payout of $164.4 million ( before withholdings ) , smaller than Whittaker 's cash payout in 2002 due to a then - recent change in the annuity structure . </P> <P> A jackpot of $365 million ( $434 million today ) was won on February 18 , 2006 by one ticket in Nebraska . It was shared by eight people who worked at a meatpacking plant . The group chose the cash option of approximately $177.3 million , before withholdings . </P> <P> On August 25 , 2007 , a jackpot worth $314 million ( $363 million today ) was won by a retired auto worker from Ohio ; that ticket was bought in Richmond , Indiana , a community that had previously sold a jackpot - winning ticket of over $200 million . </P> <P> In November 2011 , three Greenwich , Connecticut , financial executives shared a jackpot of $254.2 million ( $271 million today ) , the largest prize on a Connecticut - bought ticket . Choosing the cash option , the men split nearly $104 million after withholdings . The jackpot , at the time , was the 12th largest in Powerball history . </P> <H2> Fortune cookie payout ( edit ) </H2> <P> The Powerball drawing on March 30 , 2005 , produced 110 second - prize winners . The total payout to these winners was $19.4 million , with 89 winners receiving $100,000 each , while the other 21 winners received $500,000 each as they were Power Play selections . </P> <P> MUSL officials initially suspected fraud or a reporting error . However , all 110 winners had played numbers from fortune cookies made by Wonton Food Inc. of Long Island City , New York . The factory had printed the numbers `` 22 , 28 , 32 , 33 , 39 , 40 '' on thousands of fortunes . The `` 40 '' in the fortune did not match the Powerball number , 42 . None of the employees of Wonton Food played those numbers ; at the time , the closest game member was Connecticut . Since the ticket holders had won as result of a coincidence rather than foul play , the payouts were made . </P> <P> Had the fortune cookie given 42 as the Powerball number , these winners would have shared the $25 million jackpot : each $227,272 annuity or $122,727 cash ( before withholdings ) . The fortune on the inspiring cookie read : `` All the preparation you 've done will finally be paying off . '' </P> <H2> Computers and slot machines ( edit ) </H2> <P> In 2006 , WMS Gaming released a range of slot machines under the Powerball brand name . In 2007 , the Oregon Lottery released a Windows Sidebar gadget that displays the winning numbers for Powerball in real - time . The gadget also provides large jackpot announcements . </P> <P> The New York Lottery introduced a Powerball scratchcard in 2010 . Five winning numbers plus a powerball were printed across the top of the card , with 12 opportunities to match . Matching the winning numbers or the powerball won . The top prize was $1 million ( annuity ) ; unlike actual Powerball , there was no cash option for the top prize . </P> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Mega Millions </Li> <Li> Multi-State Lottery Association ( MUSL ) </Li> <Li> Lottery jackpot records </Li> </Ul> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ `` How Powerball manipulated the odds to create a $1.5 billion jackpot '' .

Sure , the odds of matching 1 red ball out of 35 are 1 in 35 , but we are not giving the odds for matching a red ball . We give the odds for winning a prize for matching one red ball ALONE . If you match the red ball plus at least one white ball , you win some other prize , but not this prize . The odds of matching one red ball ALONE are harder than 1 in 35 because there is some risk that you will also match one or more white ball numbers - and then win a different prize . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ `` Welcome to Powerball -- Prizes '' .
