( April 2017 ) </Td> </Tr> </Table> The internal structure of a chloroplast <P> The light - independent reactions , or dark reactions , of photosynthesis are chemical reactions that convert carbon dioxide and other compounds into glucose . These reactions occur in the stroma , the fluid - filled area of a chloroplast outside the thylakoid membranes . These reactions take the products ( ATP and NADPH ) of light - dependent reactions and perform further chemical processes on them . There are three phases to the light - independent reactions , collectively called the Calvin cycle : carbon fixation , reduction reactions , and ribulose 1 , 5 - bisphosphate ( RuBP ) regeneration . </P> <P> This process occurs only when light is available . Plants do not carry out the Calvin cycle during nighttime . They instead release sucrose into the phloem from their starch reserves . This process happens when light is available independent of the kind of photosynthesis ( C3 carbon fixation , C4 carbon fixation , and Crassulacean acid metabolism ) ; CAM plants store malic acid in their vacuoles every night and release it by day to make this process work . They are also known as dark reactions . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Coupling to other metabolic pathways <Ul> <Li> 1.1 Steps </Li> <Li> 1.2 Products </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 Light - dependent regulation </Li> <Li> 3 References </Li> <Li> 4 Further reading </Li> <Li> 5 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Coupling to other metabolic pathways ( edit ) </H2> <P> These reactions are closely coupled to the thylakoid electron transport chain as reducing power provided by NADPH produced in the photosystem I is actively needed . The process of photorespiration , also known as C2 cycle , is also coupled to the dark reactions , as it results from an alternative reaction of the RuBisCO enzyme , and its final byproduct is also another glyceraldehyde - 3 - P . </P> Overview of the Calvin cycle and carbon fixation <P> The Calvin cycle , Calvin -- Benson -- Bassham ( CBB ) cycle , reductive pentose phosphate cycle or C3 cycle is a series of biochemical redox reactions that take place in the stroma of chloroplast in photosynthetic organisms . </P> <P> The cycle was discovered by Melvin Calvin , James Bassham , and Andrew Benson at the University of California , Berkeley by using the radioactive isotope carbon - 14 . </P> <P> Photosynthesis occurs in two stages in a cell . In the first stage , light - dependent reactions capture the energy of light and use it to make the energy - storage and transport molecules ATP and NADPH . The Calvin cycle uses the energy from short - lived electronically excited carriers to convert carbon dioxide and water into organic compounds that can be used by the organism ( and by animals that feed on it ) . This set of reactions is also called carbon fixation . The key enzyme of the cycle is called RuBisCO . In the following biochemical equations , the chemical species ( phosphates and carboxylic acids ) exist in equilibria among their various ionized states as governed by the pH . </P> <P> The enzymes in the Calvin cycle are functionally equivalent to most enzymes used in other metabolic pathways such as gluconeogenesis and the pentose phosphate pathway , but they are found in the chloroplast stroma instead of the cell cytosol , separating the reactions . They are activated in the light ( which is why the name `` dark reaction '' is misleading ) , and also by products of the light - dependent reaction . These regulatory functions prevent the Calvin cycle from being respired to carbon dioxide . Energy ( in the form of ATP ) would be wasted in carrying out these reactions that have no net productivity . </P> <P> The sum of reactions in the Calvin cycle is the following : </P> <Dl> <Dd> 3 CO + 6 NADPH + 6 H + 9 ATP \u2192 glyceraldehyde - 3 - phosphate ( G3P ) + 6 NADP + 9 ADP + 3 H O + 8 P ( P = inorganic phosphate ) </Dd> </Dl> <P> Hexose ( six - carbon ) sugars are not a product of the Calvin cycle . Although many texts list a product of photosynthesis as C O , this is mainly a convenience to counter the equation of respiration , where six - carbon sugars are oxidized in mitochondria . The carbohydrate products of the Calvin cycle are three - carbon sugar phosphate molecules , or `` triose phosphates '' , namely , glyceraldehyde - 3 - phosphate ( G3P ) . </P> <H3> Steps ( edit ) </H3> <P> In the first stage of the Calvin cycle , a CO molecule is incorporated into one of two three - carbon molecules ( glyceraldehyde 3 - phosphate or G3P ) , where it uses up two molecules of ATP and two molecules of NADPH , which had been produced in the light - dependent stage . The three steps involved are : </P> Calvin cycle step 1 ( black circles represent carbon atoms ) Calvin cycle steps 2 and 3 combined <Ol> <Li> The enzyme RuBisCO catalyses the carboxylation of ribulose - 1 , 5 - bisphosphate , RuBP , a 5 - carbon compound , by carbon dioxide ( a total of 6 carbons ) in a two - step reaction . The product of the first step is enediol - enzyme complex that can capture CO or O . Thus , enediol - enzyme complex is the real carboxylase / oxygenase . The CO that is captured by enediol in second step produces an unstable six - carbon compound called 2 - carboxy 3 - keto 1 , 5 - biphosphoribotol ( or 3 - keto - 2 - carboxyarabinitol 1 , 5 - bisphosphate ) that immediately splits into 2 molecules of 3 - phosphoglycerate , or 3 - PGA , a 3 - carbon compound ( also : 3 - phosphoglyceric acid , PGA , 3PGA ) . </Li> <Li> The enzyme phosphoglycerate kinase catalyses the phosphorylation of 3 - PGA by ATP ( which was produced in the light - dependent stage ) . 1 , 3 - Bisphosphoglycerate ( 1 , 3BPGA , glycerate - 1 , 3 - bisphosphate ) and ADP are the products . ( However , note that two 3 - PGAs are produced for every CO that enters the cycle , so this step utilizes two ATP per CO fixed . ) </Li> <Li> The enzyme glyceraldehyde 3 - phosphate dehydrogenase catalyses the reduction of 1 , 3BPGA by NADPH ( which is another product of the light - dependent stage ) . Glyceraldehyde 3 - phosphate ( also called G3P , GP , TP , PGAL , GAP ) is produced , and the NADPH itself is oxidized and becomes NADP . Again , two NADPH are utilized per CO fixed . </Li> </Ol> Regeneration stage of the Calvin cycle <P> The next stage in the Calvin cycle is to regenerate RuBP . Five G3P molecules produce three RuBP molecules , using up three molecules of ATP . Since each CO molecule produces two G3P molecules , three CO molecules produce six G3P molecules , of which five are used to regenerate RuBP , leaving a net gain of one G3P molecule per three CO molecules ( as would be expected from the number of carbon atoms involved ) . </P> Simplified C3 cycle with structural formulas <P> The regeneration stage can be broken down into steps . </P> <Ol> <Li> Triose phosphate isomerase converts all of the G3P reversibly into dihydroxyacetone phosphate ( DHAP ) , also a 3 - carbon molecule . </Li> <Li> Aldolase and fructose - 1 , 6 - bisphosphatase convert a G3P and a DHAP into fructose 6 - phosphate ( 6C ) . A phosphate ion is lost into solution . </Li> <Li> Then fixation of another CO generates two more G3P . </Li> <Li> F6P has two carbons removed by transketolase , giving erythrose - 4 - phosphate . The two carbons on transketolase are added to a G3P , giving the ketose xylulose - 5 - phosphate ( Xu5P ) . </Li> <Li> E4P and a DHAP ( formed from one of the G3P from the second CO fixation ) are converted into sedoheptulose - 1 , 7 - bisphosphate ( 7C ) by aldolase enzyme . </Li> <Li> Sedoheptulose - 1 , 7 - bisphosphatase ( one of only three enzymes of the Calvin cycle that are unique to plants ) cleaves sedoheptulose - 1 , 7 - bisphosphate into sedoheptulose - 7 - phosphate , releasing an inorganic phosphate ion into solution . </Li> <Li> Fixation of a third CO generates two more G3P . The ketose S7P has two carbons removed by transketolase , giving ribose - 5 - phosphate ( R5P ) , and the two carbons remaining on transketolase are transferred to one of the G3P , giving another Xu5P . This leaves one G3P as the product of fixation of 3 CO , with generation of three pentoses that can be converted to Ru5P . </Li> <Li> R5P is converted into ribulose - 5 - phosphate ( Ru5P , RuP ) by phosphopentose isomerase . Xu5P is converted into RuP by phosphopentose epimerase . </Li> <Li> Finally , phosphoribulokinase ( another plant - unique enzyme of the pathway ) phosphorylates RuP into RuBP , ribulose - 1 , 5 - bisphosphate , completing the Calvin cycle . This requires the input of one ATP . </Li> </Ol> <P> Thus , of six G3P produced , five are used to make three RuBP ( 5C ) molecules ( totaling 15 carbons ) , with only one G3P available for subsequent conversion to hexose . This requires nine ATP molecules and six NADPH molecules per three CO molecules . The equation of the overall Calvin cycle is shown diagrammatically below . </P> The overall equation of the Calvin cycle ( black circles represent carbon atoms ) <P> RuBisCO also reacts competitively with O instead of CO in photorespiration . The rate of photorespiration is higher at high temperatures . Photorespiration turns RuBP into 3 - PGA and 2 - phosphoglycolate , a 2 - carbon molecule that can be converted via glycolate and glyoxalate to glycine . Via the glycine cleavage system and tetrahydrofolate , two glycines are converted into serine + CO . Serine can be converted back to 3 - phosphoglycerate . Thus , only 3 of 4 carbons from two phosphoglycolates can be converted back to 3 - PGA . It can be seen that photorespiration has very negative consequences for the plant , because , rather than fixing CO , this process leads to loss of CO . C4 carbon fixation evolved to circumvent photorespiration , but can occur only in certain plants native to very warm or tropical climates -- corn , for example . </P> <H3> Products ( edit ) </H3> <P> The immediate products of one turn of the Calvin cycle are 2 glyceraldehyde - 3 - phosphate ( G3P ) molecules , 3 ADP , and 2 NADP . ( ADP and NADP are not really `` products . '' They are regenerated and later used again in the Light - dependent reactions ) . Each G3P molecule is composed of 3 carbons . For the Calvin cycle to continue , RuBP ( ribulose 1 , 5 - bisphosphate ) must be regenerated . So , 5 out of 6 carbons from the 2 G3P molecules are used for this purpose . Therefore , there is only 1 net carbon produced to play with for each turn . To create 1 surplus G3P requires 3 carbons , and therefore 3 turns of the Calvin cycle . To make one glucose molecule ( which can be created from 2 G3P molecules ) would require 6 turns of the Calvin cycle . Surplus G3P can also be used to form other carbohydrates such as starch , sucrose , and cellulose , depending on what the plant needs . </P> <H2> Light - dependent regulation ( edit ) </H2> Main article : Light - dependent reactions <P> These reactions do not occur in the dark or at night . There is a light - dependent regulation of the cycle enzymes , as the third step requires reduced NADP . </P> <P> There are two regulation systems at work when the cycle must be turned on or off : the thioredoxin / ferredoxin activation system , which activates some of the cycle enzymes ; and the RuBisCo enzyme activation , active in the Calvin cycle , which involves its own activase . </P> <P> The thioredoxin / ferredoxin system activates the enzymes glyceraldehyde - 3 - P dehydrogenase , glyceraldehyde - 3 - P phosphatase , fructose - 1 , 6 - bisphosphatase , sedoheptulose - 1 , 7 - bisphosphatase , and ribulose - 5 - phosphatase kinase , which are key points of the process . This happens when light is available , as the ferredoxin protein is reduced in the photosystem I complex of the thylakoid electron chain when electrons are circulating through it . Ferredoxin then binds to and reduces the thioredoxin protein , which activates the cycle enzymes by severing a cystine bond found in all these enzymes . This is a dynamic process as the same bond is formed again by other proteins that deactivate the enzymes . The implications of this process are that the enzymes remain mostly activated by day and are deactivated in the dark when there is no more reduced ferredoxin available . </P> <P> The enzyme RuBisCo has its own , more complex activation process . It requires that a specific lysine amino acid be carbamylated to activate the enzyme . This lysine binds to RuBP and leads to a non-functional state if left uncarbamylated . A specific activase enzyme , called RuBisCo activase , helps this carbamylation process by removing one proton from the lysine and making the binding of the carbon dioxide molecule possible . Even then the RuBisCo enzyme is not yet functional , as it needs a magnesium ion bound to the lysine to function . This magnesium ion is released from the thylakoid lumen when the inner pH drops due to the active pumping of protons from the electron flow . RuBisCo activase itself is activated by increased concentrations of ATP in the stroma caused by its phosphorylation . </P> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Dl> <Dt> Citations </Dt> </Dl> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ Silverstein , Alvin ( 2008 ) .
