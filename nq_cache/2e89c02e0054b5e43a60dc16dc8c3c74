At the national level , elections were held in 270 constituencies , each electing one member to the National Assembly . At the provincial level , elections were held in each of the four provinces to elect Members of the Provincial Assemblies ( MPA ) . </P> <P> As a result of the elections , the Pakistan Tehreek - e-Insaf ( PTI ) became the single largest party at the national level both in terms of popular vote and seats . At the provincial level , the PTI became the largest party in Punjab and remained the largest party in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa ( KP ) ; the Pakistan Peoples Party ( PPP ) remained the largest party in Sindh and the newly - formed Balochistan Awami Party ( BAP ) became the largest party in Balochistan . </P> <P> Opinion polling had consistently shown leads for the Pakistan Muslim League ( N ) ( PML - N ) over the PTI . From a 11 - point lead , the PML - N 's lead began to diminish in the final weeks of the campaign , with some polls close to the election showing PTI with a lead . In the final result , the PTI made a net gain with 31.82 % of the vote ( its highest share of the vote since its foundation ) , whilst the PML - N made a net loss with 24.35 % . In the lead - up to the elections , there had been allegations by some international journalists and scholars about pre-poll rigging being conducted by the judiciary , the military and the intelligence agencies to sway the election results in favour of the PTI and against the PML - N. Almost all parties , excluding Pakistan Tehreek - e-Insaf , alleged large - scale vote rigging and administrative malpractices . </P> <P> However , Election Commission of Pakistan ( ECP ) outrightly rejected such reports and stated that elections were conducted fair and free . A top electoral watchdog , Free and Fair Election Network ( Fafen ) , also said that the 2018 general elections in Pakistan have been `` more transparent in some aspects '' than the previous polls . The European Union Election Observation Mission said , in its preliminary report , that no rigging has been found during the election day in general , however , `` lack of equality of opportunity '' in the pre-election campaign , and there were systematic attempts to undermine the ruling party PML - N. The European Union assessed the conduct of polling on election day as `` transparent '' . </P> <H2> Contents </H2> <Ul> <Li> 1 Background <Ul> <Li> 1.1 2013 elections </Li> <Li> 1.2 Azadi March ( 2014 ) </Li> <Li> 1.3 Panama Papers case ( 2016 ) </Li> <Li> 1.4 Disqualification of Nawaz Sharif ( 2017 ) </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 Electoral system <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Electoral reforms </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Contesting parties </Li> <Li> 4 Campaign <Ul> <Li> 4.1 Major by - elections ( 2017 -- 2018 ) <Ul> <Li> 4.1. 1 Lahore by - election , September 2017 </Li> <Li> 4.1. 2 Peshawar by - election , October 2017 </Li> <Li> 4.1. 3 Lodhran by - election , 2018 </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4.2 Pakistan Muslim League -- N </Li> <Li> 4.3 Pakistan Tehreek - i - Insaf </Li> <Li> 4.4 Pakistan Peoples Party </Li> <Li> 4.5 Campaigning <Ul> <Li> 4.5. 1 Nomination papers </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 5 Opinion polls </Li> <Li> 6 Conduct <Ul> <Li> 6.1 Pre-election violence </Li> <Li> 6.2 Election day violence </Li> <Li> 6.3 Allegations of election meddling <Ul> <Li> 6.3. 1 Pre-poll </Li> <Li> 6.3. 2 Election day </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 7 Results <Ul> <Li> 7.1 National Assembly </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 8 Government formation <Ul> <Li> 8.1 Election for Speakers of the National Assembly </Li> <Li> 8.2 Election for Prime Minister </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 9 Reactions <Ul> <Li> 9.1 Domestic </Li> <Li> 9.2 Economic </Li> <Li> 9.3 International </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 10 See also </Li> <Li> 11 References </Li> </Ul> <H2> Background ( edit ) </H2> <H3> 2013 elections ( edit ) </H3> Further information : Pakistani general election , 2013 \u00a7 Results <P> Following the elections in 2013 , Pakistan Muslim League ( Nawaz ) , led by twice Prime Minister of Pakistan Nawaz Sharif , emerged as the largest party with 166 seats out of a total of 342 in the National Assembly . Although this was short of a majority , Sharif was able to form a government after several independents joined his party . </P> <P> During the election campaign , Pakistan Tehreek - e-Insaf ( PTI ) , led by prominent cricketer turned politician Imran Khan , was widely expected to have huge success in the polls . The party fell short of these expectations , instead only taking 35 seats . It became the 3rd largest party in the National Assembly and formed a coalition government in the restive north - western province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa . </P> <H3> Azadi March ( 2014 ) ( edit ) </H3> Further information : Azadi March <P> PTI had initially conceded the elections to PML ( N ) , although they asked for manual recounts to be carried out in several constituencies where rigging had been allegedly carried out . These calls were not answered by the government or the Supreme Court , despite a 2,100 page white paper by the party which allegedly contained evidence of vote - rigging in favour of the PML ( N ) . An ' Azadi March ' was started by Khan on 14 August 2014 which demanded the government to call a snap election . The sit - in in Islamabad continued for 126 days , until the 2014 Peshawar school massacre occurred , which forced Khan to end the protest for the sake of ' national unity ' . A judicial commission was formed by the government which would probe the allegations of vote - rigging : it found the election to have been largely conducted in a free and fair manner , while also stating that PTI 's request for a probe was not `` entirely unjustified '' . </P> <H3> Panama papers Case ( 2016 ) ( edit ) </H3> Further information : Panama Papers case <P> On 3 April 2016 the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists ( ICIJ ) made 11.5 million secret documents , later known as the Panama Papers , available to the public . The documents , sourced from Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca , among other revelations about other public figures in many other countries , included details of eight offshore companies with links to the family of Nawaz Sharif , the then - incumbent Prime Minister of Pakistan , and his brother Shehbaz Sharif , the incumbent Chief Minister of Punjab . According to the ICIJ , Sharif 's children Maryam Nawaz , Hassan Nawaz and Hussain Nawaz `` were owners or had the right to authorise transactions for several companies '' . </P> <P> Sharif refused to resign and instead make an unsuccessful attempt to form a judicial commission . The opposition leader Khan filed a petition to the Supreme Court of Pakistan on 29 August seeking the disqualification of Sharif from the premiership and as a member of the National Assembly . Political leaders Sheikh Rasheed and Siraj - ul - Haq also supported this petition . Khan called , once again , for his supporters to put Islamabad in lockdown until Sharif resigned , although this was called off soon before it was meant to take place . </P> <P> On 20 April 2017 , on a 3 - 2 verdict , the Supreme Court decided against the disqualification of Sharif , instead calling for a Joint Investigation Team ( JIT ) to be created which would probe these allegations further . </P> <P> On 10 July 2017 , JIT submitted a 275 - page report in the apex court . The report requested NAB to file a reference against Sharif , his daughter Maryam , and his sons under section 9 of National Accountability Ordinance . Additionally , the report claimed that his daughter Maryam was guilty of falsifying documents , as she submitted a document from 2006 which used the Calibri font despite the font itself not being available for public use until 2007 . </P> <H3> Disqualification of Nawaz Sharif ( 2017 ) ( edit ) </H3> <P> On 28 July 2017 , following the submittal of the JIT report , the Supreme Court unanimously decided that Sharif was dishonest , therefore not fulfilling the requirements of articles 62 and 63 of the constitution which require one who holds public office to be Sadiq and Ameen ( Urdu for Truthful and Virtuous ) . Hence , he was disqualified as Prime Minister and as a Member of the National Assembly . The court also ordered National Accountability Bureau to file a reference against Sharif , his family and his former Finance Minister Ishaq Dar on corruption charges . </P> <H2> Electoral system ( edit ) </H2> <P> The 342 members of the National Assembly are elected by two methods in three categories ; 272 are elected in single - member constituencies by first - past - the - post voting ; 60 are reserved for females and 10 for religious minority groups ; both sets of reserved seats use proportional representation with a 5 % electoral threshold . This proportional number , however , is based on the number of seats won rather than votes cast . To win a simple majority , a party would have to take 137 seats . </P> <P> The 2018 General Elections were held under new delimitation of constituencies as a result of 2017 Census of Pakistan . Parliament of Pakistan amended the Constitution , allowing a one - time exemption for redrawing constituency boundaries using 2017 provisional census results . As per the notification issued on 5 March 2018 , the Islamabad Capital Territory ( ICT ) now has three constituencies , Punjab 141 , Sindh 61 , Khyber Pakhtunkhwa 39 , Balochistan 16 and Federally Administered Tribal Areas ( FATA ) has 12 constituencies in the National Assembly . 106 million people were registered to vote for members of the National Assembly of Pakistan and four Provincial Assemblies . </P> <P> Likewise for elections to provincial assemblies , Punjab has 297 constituencies , Sindh 130 , Khyber Pakhtunkhwa 99 and Balochistan 51 . </P> <H3> Electoral reforms ( edit ) </H3> <P> In June 2017 the Economic Coordination Committee approved the procurement of new printing machines with a bridge loan of 864 million rupees . The government has also developed new software for the Election Commission of Pakistan and NADRA to ensure a `` free , fair , impartial , transparent and peaceful general election . '' The former Federal Law Minister Zahid Hamid elaborated that youth reaching the age of 18 will automatically be registered as voters when they apply for a CNIC from NADRA . </P> <H2> Contesting parties ( edit ) </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Th_colspan=\"2\"> Party </Th> <Th> Political Position </Th> <Th> Leader </Th> <Th> Seats won previously ( FPTP ) </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> Pakistan Muslim League ( N ) </Td> <Td> Centre - right </Td> <Td> Shehbaz Sharif </Td> <Td> 126 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> Pakistan Peoples Party </Td> <Td> Centre - left </Td> <Td> Bilawal Bhutto Zardari </Td> <Td> 33 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> Pakistan Tehreek - e-Insaf </Td> <Td> Centre to Centre - right </Td> <Td> Imran Khan </Td> <Td> 28 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> Muttahida Qaumi Movement - Pakistan </Td> <Td> Left wing </Td> <Td> Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui </Td> <Td> 19 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> Muttahida Majlis - e-Amal </Td> <Td> Far right </Td> <Td> Fazl - ur - Rehman </Td> <Td> 14 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party </Td> <Td> Left wing </Td> <Td> Mahmood Khan Achakzai </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> Awami National Party </Td> <Td> Left wing </Td> <Td> Asfandyar Wali Khan </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> Pak Sarzameen Party </Td> <Td> Left wing </Td> <Td> Syed Mustafa Kamal </Td> <Td> 0 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> Tehreek Labbaik Pakistan </Td> <Td> Far right </Td> <Td> Khadim Hussain Rizvi </Td> <Td> 0 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> Balochistan Awami Party </Td> <Td> Centre </Td> <Td> Jam Kamal Khan </Td> <Td> 0 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> Grand Democratic Alliance </Td> <Td> Big tent </Td> <Td> Pir Pagaro </Td> <Td> 0 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> Balochistan National Party ( Mengal ) </Td> <Td> Left wing </Td> <Td> Akhtar Mengal </Td> <Td> 0 </Td> </Tr> </Table> <H2> Campaign ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Major by - elections ( 2017 -- 2018 ) ( edit ) </H3> <P> Following the disqualification of Nawaz Sharif , several by - elections were held throughout Pakistan . </P> Lahore by - election , September 2017 ( edit ) <P> The first of these was the by - election in Sharif 's former constituency , NA - 120 Lahore , which is located in the capital city of the Punjab province , a province where the PML ( N ) was the ruling party . It retained this seat , albeit with a much reduced majority due to gains by the PTI and minor Islamist parties . </P> Peshawar by - election , October 2017 ( edit ) <P> The second of these was a by election in Peshawar , capital city of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province , where the Pakistan Tehreek - e-Insaf was the ruling party . NA - 4 once again voted for PTI , despite a reduced majority : once again mainly due to the rise of Islamist parties . These by - elections largely were largely seen as indicators that the ruling parties in both Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab were still electorally strong . </P> Lodhran by - election , 2018 ( edit ) <P> On 15 December 2017 , Jahangir Khan Tareen , General Secretary of the PTI , was disqualified from holding public office . Hence , his NA - 154 Lodhran seat was vacated . </P> <P> In a previous by - election in this constituency in 2015 , Tareen won this seat with a majority in excess of 35,000 votes . Therefore , this seat was seen as a stronghold for the PTI . </P> <P> In what was seen as an upset result , Iqbal Shah of the PML ( N ) won this by - election with a majority over 25,000 votes against Jahangir Tareen 's son , Ali Tareen . Many saw this as a failure on the PTI 's behalf , and the result led to a drop in morale for PTI workers . </P> <H3> Pakistan Muslim League -- N ( edit ) </H3> <P> Pakistan Muslim League -- N launched its election campaign on 25 June 2018 from Karachi . On 5 July 2018 , PMLN unvieled its election manifesto . </P> <H3> Pakistan Tehreek - i - Insaf ( edit ) </H3> <P> Pakistan Tehreek - i - Insaf started its election campaign on 24 June 2018 from Mianwali . On 9 July 2018 , Imran Khan launched PTI 's election manifesto . On 23 July 2018 , PTI concluded its electioneering with rallies in Lahore . </P> <H3> Pakistan Peoples party ( edit ) </H3> <P> On 28 June 2018 , PPP became the first political party to unviel its election manifesto . PPP kicked off its election campaign on 30 June 2018 , as Bilawal inaugurated their election office in Lyari , Karachi . </P> <H3> Campaigning ( edit ) </H3> <P> The National Assembly and provincial assemblies of Pakistan dissolved as early as 28 May for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Sindh , and as late as 31 May for Punjab , Balochistan , and the National Assembly . </P> <P> The assemblies dissolved during the holy month of Ramadan , a month where Muslims worldwide refrain from eating or drinking from sunrise to sundown . Hence , most major parties did not start campaigning until late June . </P> Nomination papers ( edit ) <P> On 4 June , parties and individuals started filing nomination papers for the elections . This process continued until 8 June . After this , the returning officer in each constituency began scrutiny of the nominated candidates and decided whether or not to accept the nomination papers . </P> <P> The scrutiny resulted in many high - profile politicians having their nomination papers rejected : Imran Khan ( chairman of PTI ) , Farooq Sattar ( chairman of Muttahida Qaumi Movement ( Pakistan ) ( MQM - P ) and Pervez Musharraf ( chairman of All Pakistan Muslim League and former President ) , had their nomination papers rejected . Both Sattar and Khan had their nomination papers later accepted . </P> <P> Additionally , politicians Fawad Chaudhry ( Information Secretary of PTI ) and Shahid Khaqan Abbasi ( former Prime Minister ) were disqualified from contesting these elections by election tribunals due to the non declaration of assets in their nomination papers . This was controversial because election tribunals were seen as not having the jurisdiction to disqualify candidates , rather only to accept or reject their nomination papers . The Lahore High Court eventually overturned these judgements and allowed the respective candidates to contest their elections . Two major politicians of Tehreek - e-Insaf from Chakwal , Sardar Ghulam Abbas and Sardar Aftab Akbar Khan were disqualified to contest elections producing major problem in Chakwal district for the party . </P> <H2> Opinion polls ( edit ) </H2> Main article : Opinion polling for the Pakistani general election , 2018 Each coloured line specifies a political party and how strong their voting intention is nationwide for the National Assembly , based on a 3 - point moving average .

Several more people were injured in 7 other incidents . </Li> </Ul> <H3> Allegations of election meddling ( edit ) </H3> Pre-poll ( edit ) <P> There have been allegations by some international journalists and scholars , claiming that there was a plan between judiciary and military bodies to influence the outcome of the election . These allegations were also made by the outgoing PML - N following Nawaz Sharif 's disqualification for corruption . It was suggested that alleged goal of these attempts was to halt the party of Nawaz Sharif from coming into power and to bring the results in favor of PTI , so that Imran Khan -- who is alleged as close to the military -- can be installed as the prime minister . Khan has denied these allegations as a `` foreign conspiracy '' and `` against the facts '' , while the military also categorically rejected them . There have been claims of PML ( N ) 's campaign material being ripped apart by authorities while leaving alone material belonging to PTI . There have been suggestions that candidates belonging to PML ( N ) have been coerced by ISI to switch to those parties whose future government can be better controlled by military . On the last day of scrutiny of nomination papers , seven PML ( N ) candidates from Southern Punjab returned their tickets leaving no option for PML ( N ) to field replacement candidates , depriving them an opportunity to win those seats . There have also been reports of election engineering by army and intelligence agencies in Balochistan province in favor of Balochistan Awami Party . </P> <P> Reports further suggested that there was evidence of collusion between the judiciary and military , in that two military officials were appointed to the Joint Investigation Team to investigate corruption allegations against former prime minister Nawaz Sharif , which were further strengthened by the circumstances of the Avenfield case verdict against the Sharifs . Justice Shaukat Aziz Siddiqui , an Islamabad High Court senior justice , released a statement on 22 July alleging that judges were pressured by ISI not to release Sharif before the election . However , he provided no evidence and was at the time facing corruption and misconduct charges pending at the Supreme Judicial Council , leading to rumours about the timing of his statement . Pakistan 's Chief Justice Saqib Nisar said he felt `` saddened '' at Siddiqui 's comments , and whilst criticising them , stated that `` as the head of judiciary , I assure you that we are not under any sort of pressure '' . There have been allegations that the micromanagement of political parties and the censorship of the newspapers , social media and TV channels is to further influence the election result . An official from the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan stated that `` The level of army interference and political engineering is unprecedented . '' Another institution , the National Accountability Bureau has been described as being used by military intelligence agencies , including ISI , to bring politicians in line by threatening to bring corruption cases against them . Due to interference by military and intelligence agencies , The Financial Times described these elections as `` the dirtiest in years '' . </P> <P> Furthermore , the EU observer mission released their report after the election stating that there were `` systematic attempts to undermine the ruling party '' , `` lack of equality of opportunity '' , pressure on the media , far stronger efforts than usual to encourage switching parties and judicial conduct had all negatively influenced the vote . </P> <P> Some of these allegations have also been made by certain political parties and figures more prominently by PML ( N ) . Among the politicians , Farhatullah Babar has been very vocal against the election meddling by military describing it as a `` creeping coup against civilian authority '' . Raza Rabbani also leveled same allegations including the Election Commission of Pakistan , National Accountability Bureau and security agencies as the culprit behind pre-poll rigging . </P> Election day ( edit ) <P> Almost all political parties , with the exception of PTI , have alleged large scale election day rigging . The winning PTI have alleged rigging in some constituencies as well . Doubts were raised by unprecedented delays in the declaration of results . The fairness of the election was also criticized due to the Election Commission 's failure to provide Form 45s , official forms which include the tally of votes and are prepared in the presence of political agents of all the candidates . Party leaders alleged that their representatives were barred from polling stations before counting began and the Form 45s were prepared in their absence and behind closed doors . In some instances , the representatives were given results on plain paper instead of official forms . In another instance , the presiding officer signed blank forms , allowing the possibility of results being manipulated afterwards . Independent candidate Jibran Nasir also made similar allegations . There was also an incident of seven people being arrested for alleged vote rigging in Karachi . According to FAFEN observer Sarwar Bari , `` Only one polling agent of every party is allowed when Form 45 is given out by the polling staff , so we ca n't rule out the fact that it could be a misunderstanding . '' A few days after the election , in the NA - 241 ( Korangi Karachi - III ) constituency , ballots cast for candidates of PML ( N ) , PPP , and MQM - P were found in a garbage heap . A PTI candidate won the election in that constituency . </P> <P> Chairman of winning party Imran Khan pledged that he will allow to open any constituency his opponents think are rigged , he said that opposition has full right into recounting or accountability over election process to ensure transparency . </P> <P> The Free and Fair Election Network , an election watchdog , said the 2018 polls were `` more transparent '' in some aspects than the previous elections and that `` significant improvements in the quality of critical electoral processes '' inspired `` greater public confidence '' . According to former Indian Chief Election Commissioner S.Y. Quraishi , a member of the international observers group in Pakistan , the election system was transparent , free and fair , and the minor technical glitches which showed up later in the day were due to inexperience . </P> <P> On 12 August 2018 , it was reported that 90 % of Form - 45s were not signed by any polling agent , which is a violation of Election Act 2017 . However , an ECP spokesperson clarified the discrepancy by stating that there was no designated space on the Form - 45s to obtain the signatures of polling agents . The signatures were instead done on tamper - evident bags that were used to transport the results . For the transparency reasons and to combat controversy surrounding form 45 , election commission of Pakistan published all form 45 publicly on their website . </P> <H2> Results ( edit ) </H2> <H3> National Assembly ( edit ) </H3> <Table> <Tr> <Td_colspan=\"10\"> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th_colspan=\"2\"> Party </Th> <Th> Votes </Th> <Th> % </Th> <Th_colspan=\"5\"> Seats </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> General </Th> <Th_colspan=\"2\"> Reserved </Th> <Th> Total </Th> <Th> + / -- </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Women </Th> <Th> Minorities </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> Pakistan Tehreek -

The Speakership would be given to the PPP , the Deputy Speakership to the MMA and the Premiership to the PML - N. However , on 16 August , after the elections for speaker , PPP decided to withdraw their support for Shehbaz Sharif for the post of Prime Minister , owing to previous statements made by the individual about the party 's co-chairman and ex-President of Pakistan , Asif Ali Zardari . </P> <P> Over the next few weeks , other parties pledged their support towards the PTI nominees for speaker , deputy speaker . These parties include Balochistan National Party ( Mengal ) , Grand Democratic Alliance and Jamhoori Watan Party .
