In 1386 , Chaucer became Controller of Customs and Justice of Peace and , in 1389 , Clerk of the King 's work . It was during these years that Chaucer began working on his most famous text , The Canterbury Tales . The tales ( mostly written in verse , although some are in prose ) are presented as part of a story - telling contest by a group of pilgrims as they travel together on a journey from London to Canterbury to visit the shrine of Saint Thomas Becket at Canterbury Cathedral . The prize for this contest is a free meal at the Tabard Inn at Southwark on their return . </P> <P> After a long list of works written earlier in his career , including Troilus and Criseyde , House of Fame , and Parliament of Fowls , The Canterbury Tales is near - unanimously seen as Chaucer 's magnum opus . He uses the tales and descriptions of its characters to paint an ironic and critical portrait of English society at the time , and particularly of the Church . Chaucer 's use of such a wide range of classes and types of people was without precedent in English . Although the characters are fictional , they still offer a variety of insights into customs and practices of the time . Often , such insight leads to a variety of discussions and disagreements among people in the 14th century . For example , although various social classes are represented in these stories and all of the pilgrims are on a spiritual quest , it is apparent that they are more concerned with worldly things than spiritual . Structurally , the collection resembles Giovanni Boccaccio 's The Decameron , which Chaucer may have read during his first diplomatic mission to Italy in 1372 . </P> <P> It has been suggested that the greatest contribution of The Canterbury Tales to English literature was the popularisation of the English vernacular in mainstream literature , as opposed to French , Italian or Latin . English had , however , been used as a literary language centuries before Chaucer 's time , and several of Chaucer 's contemporaries -- John Gower , William Langland , the Pearl Poet , and Julian of Norwich -- also wrote major literary works in English . It is unclear to what extent Chaucer was seminal in this evolution of literary preference . </P> <P> While Chaucer clearly states the addressees of many of his poems , the intended audience of The Canterbury Tales is more difficult to determine . Chaucer was a courtier , leading some to believe that he was mainly a court poet who wrote exclusively for nobility . </P> <P> The Canterbury Tales is generally thought to have been incomplete at the end of Chaucer 's life . In the General Prologue , some 30 pilgrims are introduced . According to the Prologue , Chaucer 's intention was to write four stories from the perspective of each pilgrim , two each on the way to and from their ultimate destination , St. Thomas Becket 's shrine ( making for a total of about 120 stories ) . Although perhaps incomplete , The Canterbury Tales is revered as one of the most important works in English literature . It is also open to a wide range of interpretations . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Text <Ul> <Li> 1.1 Order </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 Language </Li> <Li> 3 Sources </Li> <Li> 4 Genre and structure </Li> <Li> 5 Style </Li> <Li> 6 Historical context and themes <Ul> <Li> 6.1 Religion </Li> <Li> 6.2 Social class and convention </Li> <Li> 6.3 Relativism versus realism </Li> <Li> 6.4 Liminality </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 7 Influence on literature </Li> <Li> 8 Reception <Ul> <Li> 8.1 15th century </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 9 Literary additions and supplements </Li> <Li> 10 Literary adaptations </Li> <Li> 11 Adaptations and homages </Li> <Li> 12 Notes </Li> <Li> 13 References </Li> <Li> 14 Further reading </Li> <Li> 15 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Text ( edit ) </H2> <P> The question of whether The Canterbury Tales is a finished work has not been answered to date . There are 84 manuscripts and four incunable editions of the work , dating from the late medieval and early Renaissance periods , more than for any other vernacular literary text with the exception of The Prick of Conscience . This is taken as evidence of the Tales ' popularity during the century after Chaucer 's death . Fifty - five of these manuscripts are thought to have been originally complete , while 28 are so fragmentary that it is difficult to ascertain whether they were copied individually or as part of a set . The Tales vary in both minor and major ways from manuscript to manuscript ; many of the minor variations are due to copyists ' errors , while it is suggested that in other cases Chaucer both added to his work and revised it as it was being copied and possibly as it was being distributed . Determining the text of the work is complicated by the question of the narrator 's voice which Chaucer made part of his literary structure . </P> <P> Even the oldest surviving manuscripts of the Tales are not Chaucer 's originals . The very oldest is probably MS Peniarth 392 D ( called `` Hengwrt '' ) , written by a scribe shortly after Chaucer 's death . The most beautiful , on the other hand , is the Ellesmere Manuscript , a manuscript whose order and many editors have followed even down to the present day . The first version of The Canterbury Tales to be published in print was William Caxton 's 1476 edition . Only 10 copies of this edition are known to exist , including one held by the British Library and one held by the Folger Shakespeare Library . </P> <P> In 2004 , Linne Mooney claimed that she was able to identify the scrivener who worked for Chaucer as an Adam Pinkhurst . Mooney , then a professor at the University of Maine and a visiting fellow at Corpus Christi College , Cambridge , said she could match Pinkhurst 's signature , on an oath he signed , to his handwriting on a copy of The Canterbury Tales that might have been transcribed from Chaucer 's working copy . </P> <H3> Order ( edit ) </H3> Main articles : Order of The Canterbury Tales and List of The Canterbury Tales characters <P> In the absence of consensus as to whether or not a complete version of the Tales exists , there is also no general agreement regarding the order in which Chaucer intended the stories to be placed . </P> <P> Textual and manuscript clues have been adduced to support the two most popular modern methods of ordering the tales . Some scholarly editions divide the Tales into ten `` Fragments '' . The tales that make up a Fragment are closely related and contain internal indications of their order of presentation , usually with one character speaking to and then stepping aside for another character . However , between Fragments , the connection is less obvious . Consequently , there are several possible orders ; the one most frequently seen in modern editions follows the numbering of the Fragments ( ultimately based on the Ellesmere order ) . Victorians frequently used the nine `` Groups '' , which was the order used by Walter William Skeat whose edition Chaucer : Complete Works was used by Oxford University Press for most of the twentieth century , but this order is now seldom followed . </P> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Fragment </Th> <Th> Group </Th> <Th> Tales </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 01 Fragment I </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> <Ul> <Li> General Prologue , </Li> <Li> The Knight 's Tale , </Li> <Li> The Miller 's Tale , </Li> <Li> The Reeve 's Tale , </Li> <Li> The Cook 's Tale </Li> </Ul> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 02 Fragment II </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> <Ul> <Li> The Man of Law 's Tale </Li> </Ul> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 03 Fragment III </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> <Ul> <Li> The Wife of Bath 's Tale , </Li> <Li> The Friar 's Tale , </Li> <Li> The Summoner 's Tale </Li> </Ul> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 04 Fragment IV </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> <Ul> <Li> The Clerk 's Tale , </Li> <Li> The Merchant 's Tale </Li> </Ul> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 05 Fragment V </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> <Ul> <Li> The Squire 's Tale , </Li> <Li> The Franklin 's Tale </Li> </Ul> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 06 Fragment VI </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> <Ul> <Li> The Physician 's Tale , </Li> <Li> The Pardoner 's Tale </Li> </Ul> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 07 Fragment VII </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> <Ul> <Li> The Shipman 's Tale , </Li> <Li> The Prioress 's Tale , </Li> <Li> Sir Thopas ' Tale , </Li> <Li> The Tale of Melibee , </Li> <Li> The Monk 's Tale , </Li> <Li> The Nun 's Priest 's Tale </Li> </Ul> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 08 Fragment VIII </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> <Ul> <Li> The Second Nun 's Tale , </Li> <Li> The Canon 's Yeoman 's Tale </Li> </Ul> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 09 Fragment IX </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> <Ul> <Li> The Manciple 's Tale </Li> </Ul> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 10 Fragment X </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> <Ul> <Li> The Parson 's Tale </Li> </Ul> </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> An alternative ordering ( seen in an early manuscript containing The Canterbury Tales , the early - fifteenth century Harley MS . 7334 ) places Fragment VIII before VI .

See media help . </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> Chaucer wrote in late Middle English , which has clear differences from Modern English . From philological research , we know certain facts about the pronunciation of English during the time of Chaucer . Chaucer pronounced - e at the end of words , so that care was ( \u02c8ka\u02d0r\u0259 ) , not / k\u025b\u0259r / as in Modern English . Other silent letters were also pronounced , so that the word knight was ( kni\u00e7t ) , with both the k and the gh pronounced , not / na\u026at / . In some cases , vowel letters in Middle English were pronounced very differently from Modern English , because the Great Vowel Shift had not yet happened . For instance , the long e in wepyng `` weeping '' was pronounced as ( e\u02d0 ) , as in modern German or Italian , not as / i\u02d0 / .

' </Dd> </Dl> </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> Although no manuscript exists in Chaucer 's own hand , two were copied around the time of his death by Adam Pinkhurst , a scribe with whom he seems to have worked closely before , giving a high degree of confidence that Chaucer himself wrote the Tales . Because the final - e sound was lost soon after Chaucer 's time , scribes did not accurately copy it , and this gave scholars the impression that Chaucer himself was inconsistent in using it . It has now been established , however , that - e was an important part of Chaucer 's grammar , and helped to distinguish singular adjectives from plural and subjunctive verbs from indicative . </P> <H2> Sources ( edit ) </H2> A Tale from the Decameron by John William Waterhouse <P> No other work prior to Chaucer 's is known to have set a collection of tales within the framework of pilgrims on a pilgrimage . It is obvious , however , that Chaucer borrowed portions , sometimes very large portions , of his stories from earlier stories , and that his work was influenced by the general state of the literary world in which he lived . Storytelling was the main entertainment in England at the time , and storytelling contests had been around for hundreds of years . In 14th - century England the English Pui was a group with an appointed leader who would judge the songs of the group . The winner received a crown and , as with the winner of The Canterbury Tales , a free dinner . It was common for pilgrims on a pilgrimage to have a chosen `` master of ceremonies '' to guide them and organise the journey . Harold Bloom suggests that the structure is mostly original , but inspired by the `` pilgrim '' figures of Dante and Virgil in The Divine Comedy . New research suggests that the General Prologue , in which the innkeeper and host Harry Bailey introduces each pilgrim , is a pastiche of the historical Harry Bailey 's surviving 1381 poll - tax account of Southwark 's inhabitants . </P> <P> The Decameron by Giovanni Boccaccio contains more parallels to The Canterbury Tales than any other work . Like the Tales , it features a number of narrators who tell stories along a journey they have undertaken ( to flee from the Black Death ) . It ends with an apology by Boccaccio , much like Chaucer 's Retraction to the Tales . A quarter of the tales in The Canterbury Tales parallel a tale in the Decameron , although most of them have closer parallels in other stories . Some scholars thus find it unlikely that Chaucer had a copy of the work on hand , surmising instead that he must have merely read the Decameron at some point , while a new study claims he had a copy of the Decameron and used it extensively as he began work on his own collection . Each of the tales has its own set of sources that have been suggested by scholars , but a few sources are used frequently over several tales . They include poetry by Ovid , the Bible in one of the many vulgate versions in which it was available at the time ( the exact one is difficult to determine ) , and the works of Petrarch and Dante . Chaucer was the first author to use the work of these last two , both Italians . Boethius ' Consolation of Philosophy appears in several tales , as the works of John Gower do . Gower was a known friend to Chaucer . A full list is impossible to outline in little space , but Chaucer also , lastly , seems to have borrowed from numerous religious encyclopaedias and liturgical writings , such as John Bromyard 's Summa praedicantium , a preacher 's handbook , and Jerome 's Adversus Jovinianum . Many scholars say there is a good possibility Chaucer met Petrarch or Boccaccio . </P> <H2> Genre and structure ( edit ) </H2> Canterbury Cathedral from the north west circa 1890 -- 1900 ( retouched from a black & white photograph ) <P> The Canterbury Tales is a collection of stories built around a frame narrative or frame tale , a common and already long established genre of its period . Chaucer 's Tales differs from most other story `` collections '' in this genre chiefly in its intense variation . Most story collections focused on a theme , usually a religious one . Even in the Decameron , storytellers are encouraged to stick to the theme decided on for the day . The idea of a pilgrimage to get such a diverse collection of people together for literary purposes was also unprecedented , though `` the association of pilgrims and storytelling was a familiar one '' . Introducing a competition among the tales encourages the reader to compare the tales in all their variety , and allows Chaucer to showcase the breadth of his skill in different genres and literary forms . </P> <P> While the structure of the Tales is largely linear , with one story following another , it is also much more than that . In the General Prologue , Chaucer describes not the tales to be told , but the people who will tell them , making it clear that structure will depend on the characters rather than a general theme or moral . This idea is reinforced when the Miller interrupts to tell his tale after the Knight has finished his . Having the Knight go first gives one the idea that all will tell their stories by class , with the Monk following the Knight . However , the Miller 's interruption makes it clear that this structure will be abandoned in favour of a free and open exchange of stories among all classes present . General themes and points of view arise as the characters tell their tales , which are responded to by other characters in their own tales , sometimes after a long lapse in which the theme has not been addressed . </P> <P> Lastly , Chaucer does not pay much attention to the progress of the trip , to the time passing as the pilgrims travel , or to specific locations along the way to Canterbury . His writing of the story seems focused primarily on the stories being told , and not on the pilgrimage itself . </P> <H2> Style ( edit ) </H2> Title page of Geoffrey Chaucer 's Canterbury Tales in the hand of Adam Pinkhurst , c. 1400 <P> The variety of Chaucer 's tales shows the breadth of his skill and his familiarity with many literary forms , linguistic styles , and rhetorical devices . Medieval schools of rhetoric at the time encouraged such diversity , dividing literature ( as Virgil suggests ) into high , middle , and low styles as measured by the density of rhetorical forms and vocabulary . Another popular method of division came from St. Augustine , who focused more on audience response and less on subject matter ( a Virgilian concern ) . Augustine divided literature into `` majestic persuades '' , `` temperate pleases '' , and `` subdued teaches '' . Writers were encouraged to write in a way that kept in mind the speaker , subject , audience , purpose , manner , and occasion . Chaucer moves freely between all of these styles , showing favouritism to none . He not only considers the readers of his work as an audience , but the other pilgrims within the story as well , creating a multi-layered rhetorical puzzle of ambiguities . Thus Chaucer 's work far surpasses the ability of any single medieval theory to uncover . </P> <P> With this , Chaucer avoids targeting any specific audience or social class of readers , focusing instead on the characters of the story and writing their tales with a skill proportional to their social status and learning . However , even the lowest characters , such as the Miller , show surprising rhetorical ability , although their subject matter is more lowbrow . Vocabulary also plays an important part , as those of the higher classes refer to a woman as a `` lady '' , while the lower classes use the word `` wenche '' , with no exceptions . At times the same word will mean entirely different things between classes . The word `` pitee '' , for example , is a noble concept to the upper classes , while in the Merchant 's Tale it refers to sexual intercourse . Again , however , tales such as the Nun 's Priest 's Tale show surprising skill with words among the lower classes of the group , while the Knight 's Tale is at times extremely simple . </P> <P> Chaucer uses the same meter throughout almost all of his tales , with the exception of Sir Thopas and his prose tales . It is a decasyllable line , probably borrowed from French and Italian forms , with riding rhyme and , occasionally , a caesura in the middle of a line . His meter would later develop into the heroic meter of the 15th and 16th centuries and is an ancestor of iambic pentameter . He avoids allowing couplets to become too prominent in the poem , and four of the tales ( the Man of Law 's , Clerk 's , Prioress ' , and Second Nun 's ) use rhyme royal . </P> <H2> Historical context and themes ( edit ) </H2> The Peasants ' Revolt of 1381 is mentioned in the Tales . <P> The Canterbury Tales was written during a turbulent time in English history . The Catholic Church was in the midst of the Western Schism and , though it was still the only Christian authority in Europe , was the subject of heavy controversy . Lollardy , an early English religious movement led by John Wycliffe , is mentioned in the Tales , which also mention a specific incident involving pardoners ( sellers of indulgences , which were believed to relieve the temporal punishment due for sins that were already forgiven in the Sacrament of Confession ) who nefariously claimed to be collecting for St. Mary Rouncesval hospital in England . The Canterbury Tales is among the first English literary works to mention paper , a relatively new invention that allowed dissemination of the written word never before seen in England . Political clashes , such as the 1381 Peasants ' Revolt and clashes ending in the deposing of King Richard II , further reveal the complex turmoil surrounding Chaucer in the time of the Tales ' writing . Many of his close friends were executed and he himself moved to Kent to get away from events in London . </P> <P> While some readers look to interpret the characters of The Canterbury Tales as historical figures , other readers choose to interpret its significance in less literal terms . After analysis of Chaucer 's diction and historical context , his work appears to develop a critique of society during his lifetime . Within a number of his descriptions , his comments can appear complimentary in nature , but through clever language , the statements are ultimately critical of the pilgrim 's actions . It is unclear whether Chaucer would intend for the reader to link his characters with actual persons . Instead , it appears that Chaucer creates fictional characters to be general representations of people in such fields of work . With an understanding of medieval society , one can detect subtle satire at work . </P> <H3> Religion ( edit ) </H3> <P> The Tales reflect diverse views of the Church in Chaucer 's England . After the Black Death , many Europeans began to question the authority of the established Church . Some turned to lollardy , while others chose less extreme paths , starting new monastic orders or smaller movements exposing church corruption in the behaviour of the clergy , false church relics or abuse of indulgences . Several characters in the Tales are religious figures , and the very setting of the pilgrimage to Canterbury is religious ( although the prologue comments ironically on its merely seasonal attractions ) , making religion a significant theme of the work . </P> <P> Two characters , the Pardoner and the Summoner , whose roles apply the Church 's secular power , are both portrayed as deeply corrupt , greedy , and abusive . Pardoners in Chaucer 's day were those people from whom one bought Church `` indulgences '' for forgiveness of sins , who were guilty of abusing their office for their own gain . Chaucer 's Pardoner openly admits the corruption of his practice while hawking his wares . Summoners were Church officers who brought sinners to the Church court for possible excommunication and other penalties . Corrupt summoners would write false citations and frighten people into bribing them to protect their interests . Chaucer 's Summoner is portrayed as guilty of the very kinds of sins for which he is threatening to bring others to court , and is hinted as having a corrupt relationship with the Pardoner . In The Friar 's Tale , one of the characters is a summoner who is shown to be working on the side of the devil , not God . </P> The murder of Thomas Becket <P> Churchmen of various kinds are represented by the Monk , the Prioress , the Nun 's Priest , and the Second Nun . Monastic orders , which originated from a desire to follow an ascetic lifestyle separated from the world , had by Chaucer 's time become increasingly entangled in worldly matters . Monasteries frequently controlled huge tracts of land on which they made significant sums of money , while peasants worked in their employ . The Second Nun is an example of what a Nun was expected to be : her tale is about a woman whose chaste example brings people into the church . The Monk and the Prioress , on the other hand , while not as corrupt as the Summoner or Pardoner , fall far short of the ideal for their orders . Both are expensively dressed , show signs of lives of luxury and flirtatiousness and show a lack of spiritual depth . The Prioress 's Tale is an account of Jews murdering a deeply pious and innocent Christian boy , a blood libel against Jews that became a part of English literary tradition . The story did not originate in the works of Chaucer and was well known in the 14th century . </P> <P> Pilgrimage was a very prominent feature of medieval society . The ultimate pilgrimage destination was Jerusalem , but within England Canterbury was a popular destination . Pilgrims would journey to cathedrals that preserved relics of saints , believing that such relics held miraculous powers . Saint Thomas Becket , Archbishop of Canterbury , had been murdered in Canterbury Cathedral by knights of Henry II during a disagreement between Church and Crown . Miracle stories connected to his remains sprang up soon after his death , and the cathedral became a popular pilgrimage destination . The pilgrimage in the work ties all of the stories together and may be considered a representation of Christians ' striving for heaven , despite weaknesses , disagreement , and diversity of opinion . </P> <H3> Social class and convention ( edit ) </H3> Bors ' Dilemma -- he chooses to save a maiden rather than his brother Lionel <P> The upper class or nobility , represented chiefly by the Knight and his Squire , was in Chaucer 's time steeped in a culture of chivalry and courtliness . Nobles were expected to be powerful warriors who could be ruthless on the battlefield yet mannerly in the King 's Court and Christian in their actions . Knights were expected to form a strong social bond with the men who fought alongside them , but an even stronger bond with a woman whom they idealised to strengthen their fighting ability . Though the aim of chivalry was to noble action , its conflicting values often degenerated into violence . Church leaders frequently tried to place restrictions on jousts and tournaments , which at times ended in the death of the loser . The Knight 's Tale shows how the brotherly love of two fellow knights turns into a deadly feud at the sight of a woman whom both idealise . To win her , both are willing to fight to the death . Chivalry was in Chaucer 's day on the decline , and it is possible that The Knight 's Tale was intended to show its flaws , although this is disputed . Chaucer himself had fought in the Hundred Years ' War under Edward III , who heavily emphasised chivalry during his reign . Two tales , Sir Topas and The Tale of Melibee are told by Chaucer himself , who is travelling with the pilgrims in his own story . Both tales seem to focus on the ill - effects of chivalry -- the first making fun of chivalric rules and the second warning against violence . </P> <P> The Tales constantly reflect the conflict between classes . For example , the division of the three estates : the characters are all divided into three distinct classes , the classes being `` those who pray '' ( the clergy ) , `` those who fight '' ( the nobility ) , and `` those who work '' ( the commoners and peasantry ) . Most of the tales are interlinked by common themes , and some `` quit '' ( reply to or retaliate against ) other tales . Convention is followed when the Knight begins the game with a tale , as he represents the highest social class in the group . But when he is followed by the Miller , who represents a lower class , it sets the stage for the Tales to reflect both a respect for and a disregard for upper class rules . Helen Cooper , as well as Mikhail Bakhtin and Derek Brewer , call this opposition `` the ordered and the grotesque , Lent and Carnival , officially approved culture and its riotous , and high - spirited underside . '' Several works of the time contained the same opposition . </P> <H3> Relativism versus realism ( edit ) </H3> <P> Chaucer 's characters each express different -- sometimes vastly different -- views of reality , creating an atmosphere of testing , empathy , and relativism . As Helen Cooper says , `` Different genres give different readings of the world : the fabliau scarcely notices the operations of God , the saint 's life focuses on those at the expense of physical reality , tracts and sermons insist on prudential or orthodox morality , romances privilege human emotion . '' The sheer number of varying persons and stories renders the Tales as a set unable to arrive at any definite truth or reality . </P> <H3> Liminality ( edit ) </H3> <P> The concept of liminality figures prominently within The Canterbury Tales . A liminal space , which can be both geographical as well as metaphorical or spiritual , is the transitional or transformational space between a `` real '' ( secure , known , limited ) world and an unknown or imaginary space of both risk and possibility . The notion of a pilgrimage is itself a liminal experience , because it centers on travel between destinations and because pilgrims undertake it hoping to become more holy in the process . Thus , the structure of The Canterbury Tales itself is liminal ; it not only covers the distance between London and Canterbury , but the majority of the tales refer to places entirely outside the geography of the pilgrimage . Jean Jost summarises the function of liminality in The Canterbury Tales , </P> <P> `` Both appropriately and ironically in this raucous and subversive liminal space , a ragtag assembly gather together and tell their equally unconventional tales . In this unruly place , the rules of tale telling are established , themselves to be both disordered and broken ; here the tales of game and earnest , solas and sentence , will be set and interrupted . Here the sacred and profane adventure begins , but does not end . Here , the condition of peril is as prominent as that of protection . The act of pilgrimaging itself consists of moving from one urban space , through liminal rural space , to the next urban space with an ever fluctuating series of events and narratives punctuating those spaces . The goal of pilgrimage may well be a religious or spiritual space at its conclusion , and reflect a psychological progression of the spirit , in yet another kind of emotional space . '' </P> <P> Liminality is also evident in the individual tales . An obvious instance of this is the Friar 's Tale in which the yeoman devil is a liminal figure because of his transitory nature and function ; it is his purpose to issue souls from their current existence to hell , an entirely different one . The Franklin 's Tale is a Breton Lai tale , which takes the tale into a liminal space by invoking not only the interaction of the supernatural and the mortal , but also the relation between the present and the imagined past . </P> <H2> Influence on literature ( edit ) </H2> <P> It is sometimes argued that the greatest contribution that this work made to English literature was in popularising the literary use of the vernacular English , rather than French or Latin . English had , however , been used as a literary language for centuries before Chaucer 's life , and several of Chaucer 's contemporaries -- John Gower , William Langland , and the Pearl Poet -- also wrote major literary works in English . It is unclear to what extent Chaucer was responsible for starting a trend rather than simply being part of it . It is interesting to note that , although Chaucer had a powerful influence in poetic and artistic terms , which can be seen in the great number of forgeries and mistaken attributions ( such as The Floure and the Leafe , which was translated by John Dryden ) , modern English spelling and orthography owe much more to the innovations made by the Court of Chancery in the decades during and after his lifetime . </P> <H2> Reception ( edit ) </H2> Chaucer as a Pilgrim from the Ellesmere manuscript . Opening prologue of The Wife of Bath 's Tale from the Ellesmere Manuscript . <P> While Chaucer clearly states the addressees of many of his poems ( the Book of the Duchess is believed to have been written for John of Gaunt on the occasion of his wife 's death in 1368 ) , the intended audience of The Canterbury Tales is more difficult to determine . Chaucer was a courtier , leading some to believe that he was mainly a court poet who wrote exclusively for the nobility . He is referred to as a noble translator and poet by Eustache Deschamps and by his contemporary John Gower . It has been suggested that the poem was intended to be read aloud , which is probable as this was a common activity at the time . However , it also seems to have been intended for private reading as well , since Chaucer frequently refers to himself as the writer , rather than the speaker , of the work . Determining the intended audience directly from the text is even more difficult , since the audience is part of the story . This makes it difficult to tell when Chaucer is writing to the fictional pilgrim audience or the actual reader . </P> <P> Chaucer 's works may have been distributed in some form during his lifetime in part or in whole . Scholars speculate that manuscripts were circulated among his friends , but likely remained unknown to most people until after his death . However , the speed with which copyists strove to write complete versions of his tale in manuscript form shows that Chaucer was a famous and respected poet in his own day . The Hengwrt and Ellesmere manuscripts are examples of the care taken to distribute the work . More manuscript copies of the poem exist than for any other poem of its day except The Prick of Conscience , causing some scholars to give it the medieval equivalent of bestseller status . Even the most elegant of the illustrated manuscripts , however , is not nearly as highly decorated as the work of authors of more respectable works such as John Lydgate 's religious and historical literature . </P> <H3> 15th century ( edit ) </H3> <P> John Lydgate and Thomas Occleve were among the first critics of Chaucer 's Tales , praising the poet as the greatest English poet of all time and the first to show what the language was truly capable of poetically . This sentiment was universally agreed upon by later critics into the mid-15th century . Glosses included in The Canterbury Tales manuscripts of the time praised him highly for his skill with `` sentence '' and rhetoric , the two pillars by which medieval critics judged poetry . The most respected of the tales was at this time the Knight 's , as it was full of both . </P> <H2> Literary additions and supplements ( edit ) </H2> <P> The incompleteness of the Tales led several medieval authors to write additions and supplements to the tales to make them more complete . Some of the oldest existing manuscripts of the tales include new or modified tales , showing that even early on , such additions were being created . These emendations included various expansions of the Cook 's Tale , which Chaucer never finished , The Plowman 's Tale , The Tale of Gamelyn , the Siege of Thebes , and the Tale of Beryn . </P> <P> The Tale of Beryn , written by an anonymous author in the 15th century , is preceded by a lengthy prologue in which the pilgrims arrive at Canterbury and their activities there are described . While the rest of the pilgrims disperse throughout the town , the Pardoner seeks the affections of Kate the barmaid , but faces problems dealing with the man in her life and the innkeeper Harry Bailey . As the pilgrims turn back home , the Merchant restarts the storytelling with Tale of Beryn . In this tale , a young man named Beryn travels from Rome to Egypt to seek his fortune only to be cheated by other businessmen there . He is then aided by a local man in getting his revenge . The tale comes from the French tale B\u00e9rinus and exists in a single early manuscript of the tales , although it was printed along with the tales in a 1721 edition by John Urry . </P> <P> John Lydgate wrote The Siege of Thebes in about 1420 . Like the Tale of Beryn , it is preceded by a prologue in which the pilgrims arrive in Canterbury . Lydgate places himself among the pilgrims as one of them and describes how he was a part of Chaucer 's trip and heard the stories . He characterises himself as a monk and tells a long story about the history of Thebes before the events of the Knight 's Tale . John Lydgate 's tale was popular early on and exists in old manuscripts both on its own and as part of the Tales . It was first printed as early as 1561 by John Stow , and several editions for centuries after followed suit . </P> <P> There are actually two versions of The Plowman 's Tale , both of which are influenced by the story Piers Plowman , a work written during Chaucer 's lifetime . Chaucer describes a Plowman in the General Prologue of his tales , but never gives him his own tale . One tale , written by Thomas Occleve , describes the miracle of the Virgin and the Sleeveless Garment . Another tale features a pelican and a griffin debating church corruption , with the pelican taking a position of protest akin to John Wycliffe 's ideas . </P> <P> The Tale of Gamelyn was included in an early manuscript version of the tales , Harley 7334 , which is notorious for being one of the lower - quality early manuscripts in terms of editor error and alteration . It is now widely rejected by scholars as an authentic Chaucerian tale , although some scholars think he may have intended to rewrite the story as a tale for the Yeoman . Dates for its authorship vary from 1340 to 1370 . </P> <H2> Literary adaptations ( edit ) </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> This section does not cite any sources .

( November 2009 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> Many literary works ( both fiction and non-fiction alike ) have used a similar frame narrative to The Canterbury Tales as an homage . Science - fiction writer Dan Simmons wrote his Hugo Award winning novel Hyperion based on an extra-planetary group of pilgrims . Evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins used The Canterbury Tales as a structure for his 2004 non-fiction book about evolution titled The Ancestor 's Tale : A Pilgrimage to the Dawn of Evolution . His animal pilgrims are on their way to find the common ancestor , each telling a tale about evolution . </P> <P> Henry Dudeney 's book The Canterbury Puzzles contains a part reputedly lost from what modern readers know as Chaucer 's tales . </P> <P> Historical - mystery novelist P.C. Doherty wrote a series of novels based on The Canterbury Tales , making use of both the story frame and Chaucer 's characters . </P> <P> Canadian author Angie Abdou translates The Canterbury Tales to a cross section of people , all snow - sports enthusiasts but from different social backgrounds , converging on a remote back - country ski cabin in British Columbia in the 2011 novel The Canterbury Trail . </P> <H2> Adaptations and homages ( edit ) </H2> <P> The Two Noble Kinsmen , by William Shakespeare and John Fletcher , a retelling of `` The Knight 's Tale '' , was first performed in 1613 or 1614 and published in 1634 . In 1961 , Erik Chisholm completed his opera , The Canterbury Tales . The opera is in three acts : The Wyf of Bath 's Tale , The Pardoner 's Tale and The Nun 's Priest 's Tale . Nevill Coghill 's modern English version formed the basis of a musical version that was first staged in 1964 . </P> <P> A Canterbury Tale , a 1944 film jointly written and directed by Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger , is loosely based on the narrative frame of Chaucer 's tales . The movie opens with a group of medieval pilgrims journeying through the Kentish countryside as a narrator speaks the opening lines of the General Prologue . The scene then makes a now - famous transition to the time of World War II . From that point on , the film follows a group of strangers , each with his or her own story and in need of some kind of redemption , who are making their way to Canterbury together . The film 's main story takes place in an imaginary town in Kent and ends with the main characters arriving at Canterbury Cathedral , bells pealing and Chaucer 's words again resounding . A Canterbury Tale is recognised as one of the Powell - Pressburger team 's most poetic and artful films . It was produced as wartime propaganda , using Chaucer 's poetry , referring to the famous pilgrimage , and offering photography of Kent to remind the public of what made Britain worth fighting for . In one scene a local historian lectures an audience of British soldiers about the pilgrims of Chaucer 's time and the vibrant history of England . </P> <P> Pier Paolo Pasolini 's 1972 film The Canterbury Tales features several of the tales , some of which keep close to the original tale and some of which are embellished . The Cook 's Tale , for instance , which is incomplete in the original version , is expanded into a full story , and the Friar 's Tale extends the scene in which the Summoner is dragged down to hell . The film includes these two tales as well as the Miller 's Tale , the Summoner 's Tale , the Wife of Bath 's Tale , and the Merchant 's Tale . </P> <P> On April 26 , 1986 , American radio personality Garrison Keillor opened `` The News from Lake Wobegon '' portion of the first live TV broadcast of his A Prairie Home Companion radio show with a reading of the original Middle English text of the General Prologue . He commented , `` Although those words were written more than 600 years ago , they still describe spring . '' </P> <P> Television adaptations include Alan Plater 's 1975 re-telling of the stories in a series of plays for BBC2 : Trinity Tales . In 2003 , BBC again featured modern re-tellings of selected tales . </P> Ezra Winter , Canterbury tales mural ( 1939 ) , Library of Congress John Adams Building , Washington , D.C.

Although Chaucer undoubtedly studied the works of these celebrated writers , and particularly of Dante before this fortunate interview ; yet it seems likely , that these excursions gave him a new relish for their compositions , and enlarged his knowledge of the Italian fables . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Brewer , p. 277 ... where he became thoroughly inbued with the spirit and excellence of the great Italian poets and prose - writers : Dante , Petrarch , Boccaccio ; and is said to have had a personal contact interview with one of these , Petrarch . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Hendrickson , pp. 183 -- 192 . Professor G.L. Hendrickson of the University of Chicago gives a detailed analysis as to Chaucer coming in contact with Petrarch . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Rearden , p. 458 . There can be no moral doubt but that Chaucer knew Petrarch personally . They were both in France many times , where they might have met . They were both courtiers . They both had an enthusiasm for scholarship . Whether they met then , or whether Chaucer , when on his visit to Genoa , specially visited the Italian , it does not appear ... but the only reason that such a visit could not have occurred lies in the fact that Petrarch himself does not record it . Still , on the other hand , would he have mentioned the visit of a man who was the servant of a barbarous monarch , and whose only claim to notice , literary-wise , was his cultivation of an unknown and uncouth dialect that was half bastard French ? </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Skeat ( 1874 ) , p. xxx . And we know that Petrarch , on his own shewing , was so pleased with the story of Griselda that he learnt it by heart as well as he could , for the express purpose of repeating it to friends , before the idea of turning it into Latin occurred to him . Whence we may conclude that Chaucer and Petrarch met at Padua early in 1373 ; that Petrarch told Chaucer the story by word of mouth , either in Italian or French ; and that Chaucer shortly after obtained a copy of Petrarch 's Latin version , which he kept constantly before him whilst making his own translation . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ `` Sources and Analogues of the Canterbury Tales '' , 2002 , p. 22 . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Cooper , 8 -- 9 . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Cooper , 17 -- 18 . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Cooper , 18 . </Li> <Li> ^ Jump up to : Podgorski , Daniel ( December 29 , 2015 ) . `` Puppetry and the `` Popet : '' Fiction , Reality , and Empathy in Geoffrey Chaucer 's Canterbury Tales `` .
