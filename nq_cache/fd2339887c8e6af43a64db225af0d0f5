The council of 500 in ancient Athens rotated its entire membership annually , as did the ephorate in ancient Sparta . The ancient Roman Republic featured a system of elected magistrates -- tribunes of the plebs , aediles , quaestors , praetors , and consuls -- who served a single term of one year , with re-election to the same magistracy forbidden for ten years ( see cursus honorum ) . According to historian Garrett Fagan , office holding in the Roman Republic was based on `` limited tenure of office '' which ensured that `` authority circulated frequently '' , helping to prevent corruption . An additional benefit of the cursus honorum or Run of Offices was to bring the `` most experienced '' politicians to the upper echelons of power - holding in the ancient republic . Many of the founders of the United States were educated in the classics , and quite familiar with rotation in office during antiquity . The debates of that day reveal a desire to study and profit from the object lessons offered by ancient democracy . </P> <P> Prior to independence , several colonies had already experimented with term limits . The Fundamental Orders of Connecticut of 1639 , for example , prohibited the colonial governor from serving consecutive terms , setting terms at one year 's length , and holding `` that no person be chosen Governor above once in two years . '' Shortly after independence , the Pennsylvania Constitution of 1776 set maximum service in the Pennsylvania General Assembly at `` four years in seven '' . Benjamin Franklin 's influence is seen not only in that he chaired the constitutional convention which drafted the Pennsylvania constitution , but also because it included , virtually unchanged , Franklin 's earlier proposals on executive rotation . Pennsylvania 's plural executive was composed of twelve citizens elected for the term of three years , followed by a mandatory vacation of four years . </P> <P> The Articles of Confederation , adopted in 1781 , established term limits for the delegates to the Continental Congress , mandating in Article V that `` no person shall be capable of being a delegate for more than three years in any term of six years . '' </P> <P> On October 2 , 1789 , the Continental Congress appointed a committee of thirteen to examine forms of government for the impending union of the states . Among the proposals was that from the State of Virginia , written by Thomas Jefferson , urging a limitation of tenure , `` to prevent every danger which might arise to American freedom by continuing too long in office the members of the Continental Congress '' . The committee made recommendations , which as regards congressional term limits were incorporated unchanged into the Articles of Confederation ( 1781 -- 89 ) . The fifth Article stated that `` no person shall be capable of being a delegate ( to the continental congress ) for more than three years in any term of six years '' . </P> <H3> Term limits in the Constitution ( edit ) </H3> <P> In contrast to the Articles of Confederation , the federal constitution convention at Philadelphia omitted mandatory term limits from the U.S. Constitution of 1789 . At the convention , some delegates spoke passionately against term limits such as Rufus King , who said `` that he who has proved himself to be most fit for an Office , ought not to be excluded by the constitution from holding it . '' The Electoral College , it was believed by some delegates at the convention , could have a role to play in limiting unfit officers from continuing . </P> <P> When the states ratified the Constitution ( 1787 -- 88 ) , several leading statesmen regarded the lack of mandatory limits to tenure as a dangerous defect , especially , they thought , as regards the presidency and the Senate . Richard Henry Lee viewed the absence of legal limits to tenure , together with certain other features of the Constitution , as `` most highly and dangerously oligarchic '' . Both Jefferson and George Mason advised limits on reelection to the Senate and to the Presidency , because said Mason , `` nothing is so essential to the preservation of a Republican government as a periodic rotation '' . The historian Mercy Otis Warren , warned that `` there is no provision for a rotation , nor anything to prevent the perpetuity of office in the same hands for life ; which by a little well - timed bribery , will probably be done '' . </P> <H3> After 1789 ( edit ) </H3> <P> Michael Korzi says George Washington did not set the informal precedent for a two - term limit for the Presidency . He only meant he was too worn out to personally continue in office . It was Thomas Jefferson who made it a principle in 1808 . He made many statements calling for term limits in one form or another . </P> <P> The tradition was challenged by Ulysses Grant in 1880 , and by Theodore Roosevelt in 1912 . Otherwise no major effort to avoid it took place until 1940 when Franklin Roosevelt explicitly broke it . The 22nd Amendment to the U.S. Constitution was ratified in 1951 formally establishing in law the two - term limit -- although it did not apply to the incumbent Harry Truman . </P> <P> The fact that `` perpetuity in office '' was not approached until the 20th century is due in part to the influence of rotation in office as a popular 19th - century concept . `` Ideas are , in truth , forces '' , and rotation in office enjoyed such normative support , especially at the local level , that it altered political reality . For a detailed study of the 19th - century concepts of rotation , consult Political Science Quarterly , vol. 94 , `` House Turnover and the Principle of Rotation '' , by Robert Struble , Jr . See also his Treatise on Twelve Lights , chapter six , `` Rotation in History '' . Consult also , James Young 's The Washington Community , 1800 -- 1828 . </P> <P> According to Young , the tendency to look with mistrust upon political power was so ingrained into American culture that even the officeholders themselves perceived their occupations in a disparaging light . James Fenimore Cooper described the common view that `` contact with the affairs of state is one of the most corrupting of the influences to which men are exposed '' . An article in the Richmond Enquirer ( 1822 ) noted that the `` long cherished '' principle of rotation in office had been impressed on the republican mind `` by a kind of intuitive impulse , unassailable to argument or authority '' . </P> <P> Beginning about the 1830s , Jacksonian democracy introduced a less idealistic twist to the practice of limiting terms . Rotation in office came to mean taking turns in the distribution of political prizes . Rotation of nominations to the U.S. House of Representatives -- the prizes -- became a key element of payoffs to the party faithful . The leading lights in the local party machinery came to regard a nomination for the House as `` salary '' for political services rendered . A new code of political ethics evolved , based on the proposition that `` turnabout is fair play '' . In short , rotation of nominations was intertwined with the spoils system . </P> <P> In district nominating conventions local leaders could negotiate and enforce agreements to pass the nominations around among themselves . Abraham Lincoln was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1846 under such a bargain , and he returned home to Springfield after a single congressional term because , he wrote , `` to enter myself as a competitor of another , or to authorize anyone so to enter me , is what my word and honor forbid '' . </P> <P> During the Civil War , the Confederate States Constitution limited its president to a single six - year term . </P> <H3> Era of incumbency ( edit ) </H3> <P> The practice of nomination rotation for the House of Representatives began to decline after the Civil War . It took a generation or so before the direct primary system , civil service reforms , and the ethic of professionalism worked to eliminate rotation in office as a common political practice . By the turn of the 20th century the era of incumbency was coming into full swing . </P> <P> A total of 8 presidents served two full terms and declined a third and three presidents served one full term and refused a second . After World War II , however , an officeholder class had developed to the point that congressional tenure rivaled that of the U.S. Supreme Court , where tenure is for life . </P> <H3> Term limits movement ( edit ) </H3> <P> `` Homesteading , '' or securing a lifelong career in Congress , was made possible by reelection rates that approached 100 % by the end of the 20th century . The concept of homesteading brought about a popular movement known as the `` term - limits movement '' . The elections of 1990 -- 94 saw the adoption of term limits for state legislatures in almost every state where citizens had the power of the initiative . In addition , 23 states limited service in their delegation to Congress . As they pertain to Congress , these laws are no longer enforceable , however , as in 1995 , the U.S. Supreme Court overturned congressional term limits in U.S. Term Limits , Inc. v. Thornton , ruling that state governments can not limit the terms of members of the national government . </P> <P> Where rotation in the legislative branch has withstood court challenges , term limits continue to garner popular support . As of 2002 , the advocacy group `` U.S. Term Limits '' found that in the 17 states where state legislators served in rotation , public support for term limits ranged from 60 to 78 percent . </P> <H2> Federal term limits ( edit ) </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Office </Th> <Th> Term limits </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> President </Td> <Td> Limited to being elected to a total of 2 four - year terms . A President by succession who completes more than two years of a former President 's unfinished term may be elected in his or her own right only once , and 2 more four - year terms are permitted if they complete two years or less . Becoming a President by succession may happen to someone an unlimited number of times , for example , if he or she is Vice President and the President dies , resigns or is removed from office via impeachment conviction . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Vice President </Td> <Td> Unlimited four - year terms </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> House of Representatives </Td> <Td> Unlimited two - year terms </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Senate </Td> <Td> Unlimited six - year terms </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Supreme Court </Td> <Td> No term limits , appointed to serve `` during good behavior '' ( but can be impeached and removed from office for `` high Crimes and Misdemeanors '' ) ; in practice a Justice serves until death or stepping down ( by retirement or resignation ) </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> As of 2013 , term limits at the federal level are restricted to the executive branch and some agencies . Judicial appointments at the federal level are made for life , and are not subject to election or to term limits . The U.S. Congress remains ( since the Thornton decision of 1995 ) without electoral limits . </P> <H3> President ( edit ) </H3> <P> The third president , Thomas Jefferson , started the tradition of presidential term limits by refusing to run for a third term in 1808 . Everything the first president did obviously set a precedent , but did not necessarily set a new policy . However George Washington 's decision in 1796 not to run for a third term has sometimes been given credit as the start of a `` tradition '' of the strong policy that no president should ever run for a third term . Washington wanted to retire when his first term ended in 1792 but all his advisors begged him to stand for reelection . By 1796 he insisted on retiring , for he felt worn out , and was disgusted with the virulent personal attacks on his integrity . His Farewell Address very briefly mentioned why he would not run for a third term , and goes on to give a great deal of political advice . But he does not mention of term limits . After his death his refusal to run was explained in terms of a `` no - third - tradition '' . Historian David Crocket argues , `` The argument for term limits has a solid and respectable pedigree . Contrary to popular belief , however , that pedigree does not begin with George Washington . '' </P> <P> Politically Washington felt the stability of the republic required a contested presidential election with a choice of candidates , which would not happen if he ran again . If he won and then died a vice president would take over who was not elected and his goal would fail . ( He in fact did die in 1799 two years into the new term ) . The election went forward and he was absolutely neutral between John Adams and Thomas Jefferson . He personally did not feel bound by a two - term limit . In the 1780s , about half the states provided term limits for governors . The Constitutional convention of 1787 discussed the issue and decided not to do so . `` The matter was fairly discussed in the Convention , '' Washington wrote in 1788 , `` and to my full convictions ... I can see no propriety in precluding ourselves from the services of any man , who on some great emergency shall be deemed universally , most capable of serving the Public '' even after serving two terms . The Constitution , Washington explained , retained sufficient checks against political corruption and stagnant leadership without a presidential term limits provision . Jefferson , however , strongly endorsed a policy of term limits . He rejected calls from supporters that he run for a third term in 1808 , telling several state legislatures in 1807 - 1808 that he needed to support `` the sound precedent set by ( his ) illustrious predecessor . '' </P> <P> Thomas Jefferson mentioned that Washington retired after serving only two terms , without mentioning that Washington opposed the policy Jefferson was proposing . Crockett argues that Washington , `` did not intentionally establish the so - called two - term tradition ; his departure was motivated by a desire to demonstrate that the country could function without him and to retire to Mount Vernon . He made no principled argument for limiting presidents to two terms , and in fact disagreed with Thomas Jefferson on this point . '' The `` two term tradition '' was created in 1807 - 1808 and it mistakenly suggested Washington had launched the policy . </P> A political cartoon showing Washington rejecting Theodore Roosevelt 's highly controversial run for a third term in 1912 <P> In 1861 the Confederate States of America adopted a six - year term for their president and vice-president and barred the president from seeking re-election . That innovation was endorsed by many American politicians after the Civil War , most notably by Rutherford B. Hayes in his inaugural address . Ulysses Grant was urged to run for a third term in 1876 , but he refused . He did try for the 1880 nomination but was defeated in part because of anti-third - term sentiment . Theodore Roosevelt had already served over 7 years and in 1912 , after a four - year hiatus , ran for a third term . He was violently criticized -- indeed almost killed by John Flammang Schrank , who was obsessed with stopping a third term . </P> <P> Franklin D. Roosevelt ( president , 1933 -- 1945 ) in 1940 was the only president to break the tradition , winning a third term in 1940 and a fourth term in 1944 . This gave rise to a successful move to formalize the traditional two - term limit by amending the U.S. Constitution . As ratified in 1951 , the Twenty - Second Amendment provides that `` no person shall be elected to the office of President more than twice '' . The new Amendment explicitly did not apply to the incumbent , President Harry S. Truman . However all his close advisors , pointing to his age , his failing abilities , and his poor showing in the polls , talked him out of it . </P> <H3> Congress ( edit ) </H3> Letter from Senator Orrin Hatch , first elected in 1976 , expressing reservations regarding term limits ( dated February 10 , 2011 ) <P> Reformers during the early 1990s used the initiative and referendum to put congressional term limits on the ballot in 24 states . Voters in eight of these states approved the congressional term limits by an average electoral margin of two to one . It was an open question whether states had the constitutional authority to enact these limits . In May 1995 , the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 5 -- 4 in U.S. Term Limits , Inc. v. Thornton , 514 U.S. 779 ( 1995 ) , that states can not impose term limits upon their federal Representatives or Senators . </P> <P> In the 1994 elections , part of the Republican platform included legislation for term limits in Congress . After winning the majority , a Republican congressman brought a constitutional amendment to the House floor that proposed limiting members of the Senate to two six - year terms and members of the House to six two - year terms . However , this rate of rotation was so slow ( the life - tenured Supreme Court averages in the vicinity of twelve years ) that the congressional version of term - limits garnered little support among the populist backers of term limits , including U.S. Term Limits , the largest private organization pushing for congressional term limits . The bill got only a bare majority ( 227 -- 204 ) , falling short of the two - thirds majority ( 290 ) needed for constitutional amendments . Three other term limit amendment bills failed to get more than 200 votes . </P> <P> Defeated in Congress and overridden by the Supreme Court , the federal term limit uprising was brought to a halt . The term limits intended simultaneously to reform state legislatures ( as distinguished from the federal congressional delegations ) remain in force , however , in fifteen states . </P> <P> In 2007 Larry J. Sabato revived the debate over term limits by arguing in A More Perfect Constitution that the success and popularity of term limits at the state level suggests that they should be adopted at the federal level as well . He specifically put forth the idea of congressional term limits and suggested a national constitutional convention be used to accomplish the amendment , since the Congress would be unlikely to propose and adopt any amendment that limits its own power . </P> <P> Some state legislators have also expressed their opinions on term limits . It is confirmed that in the following five states -- and there may be others -- state lawmakers approved resolutions asking Congress to propose a federal constitutional amendment to limit the number of terms which members of Congress may serve : </P> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> This section has an unclear citation style .

No. 41 was indeed received by the U.S. House of Representatives , and was designated as Memorial 416 , ( Congressional Record of June 6 , 1990 , at pages 13262 and 13263 ) but the resolution was erroneously referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce -- and its text is NOT provided in the Congressional Record ; </Li> <Li> Utah Legislature ( designated as POM - 644 in the U.S. Senate ) approved in 1990 , Utah Senate Joint Resolution No. 24 ( see Congressional Record of September 27 , 1994 , at page 26033 , with verbatim text provided ) it took four years for this resolution to find its way into the U.S. Senate 's portion of the Congressional Record ; </Li> <Li> Idaho Legislature ( designated as Memorial 401 in the U.S. House of Representatives ) approved in 1992 , Idaho Senate Joint Memorial No. 116 ( see Congressional Record of April 29 , 1992 , at page 9804 -- text NOT provided in the Congressional Record ) ; and </Li> <Li> Florida Legislature ( designated as POM - 122 in the U.S. Senate ) approved in 2012 , Florida House Memorial No. 83 ( see Congressional Record of July 25 , 2012 , at page S5378 , with verbatim text provided ) . Taking matters a bit further , on February 10 , 2016 , Florida lawmakers approved House Memorial No. 417 calling upon Congress , pursuant to Article V of the Federal Constitution , to assemble a Convention to prepare a constitutional amendment that would establish term limits upon members of Congress . </Li> </Ol> <H3> Supreme Court ( edit ) </H3> <P> Legal scholars have discussed whether or not to impose term limits on the Supreme Court of the United States . Currently , Supreme Court Justices are appointed for life `` during good behavior '' . A sentiment has developed , among certain scholars , that the Supreme Court may not be accountable in a way that is most in line with the spirit of checks and balances . Equally , scholars have argued that life tenure has taken on a new meaning in a modern context . Changes in medical care have markedly raised life expectancy and therefore has allowed Justices to serve for longer than ever before . Steven G. Calebresi and James Lindgren , professors of law at Northwestern University , argued that , because vacancies in the court are occurring with less frequency and justices served on average , between 1971 and 2006 , for 26.1 years , the `` efficacy of the democratic check that the appointment process provides on the Court 's membership '' is reduced . There have been several similar proposals to implement term limits for the nation 's highest court , including Professor of Law at Duke University , Paul Carrington 's 2005 `` The Supreme Court Renewal Act of 2005 '' . </P> <P> Many of the proposals center around a term limit for Justices that would be 18 years ( Larry Sabato , Professor of Political Science at University of Virginia , suggested between 15 and 18 years ) . The proposed staggered term limits of 18 years would , according to Calebresi , Lindgren ( 2006 ) , and Carrington ( 2005 ) , allow for a new appointment to the Court every two years , which in effect would allow every president at least two appointments . Professor Carrington has argued that such a measure would not require a constitutional amendment as the `` Constitution does n't even mention life tenure ; it merely requires that justices serve during ' good behaviour ' `` . The idea was not without support among Judges , as John Roberts supported term limits before he was appointed to the Supreme Court as Chief Justice . Calebresi , Lingren , and Carrington have also proposed that when justices have served out their proposed 18 - year term they should be able to sit on other Federal Courts until retirement , death , or removal . </P> <P> Fairleigh Dickinson University 's PublicMind Poll measured American voters ' attitudes towards various proposed Supreme Court reforms , including implementing term limits . The 2010 poll found that a majority of Americans were largely unaware of a proposal to impose a term limit of 18 years , as 82 % reported they had heard little or nothing at all . Notwithstanding a lack of awareness , 52 % of Americans approved of limiting terms to 18 years , while 35 % disapproved . When asked how old is too old for a Supreme Court judge to serve if he or she seems healthy , 48 % said `` no limit as long as he or she is healthy '' , while 31 % agreed that anyone over the age of 70 is too old . </P> <P> Some state lawmakers have officially expressed to Congress a desire for a federal constitutional amendment to limit terms of Supreme Court justices as well as of judges of federal courts below the Supreme Court level . While there might be others , below are three known examples : </P> <Ol> <Li> In 1957 , the Alabama Legislature adopted Senate Joint Resolution No. 47 on the subject ( appearing in the U.S. Senate 's portion of the Congressional Record on July 3 , 1957 , at page 10863 , with full text provided ) ; </Li> <Li> In 1978 , the Tennessee General Assembly adopted House Joint Resolution No. 21 on the subject ( designated as POM - 612 by the U.S. Senate and quoted in full in the Congressional Record of April 25 , 1978 , at page 11437 ) ; and </Li> <Li> In 1998 , the Louisiana House of Representatives adopted House Resolution No. 120 on the subject ( designated as POM - 511 by the U.S. Senate and quoted in full in the Congressional Record of July 17 , 1998 , at page 16076 ) . </Li> </Ol> <H2> State term limits ( edit ) </H2> See also : Comparison of State Governments <P> Term limits for state officials have existed since colonial times . The Pennsylvania Charter of Liberties of 1682 , and the colonial frame of government of the same year , both authored by William Penn , provided for triennial rotation of the provincial council -- the upper house of the colonial legislature . The Delaware Constitution of 1776 limited the governor to a single three - year term ; currently , the governor of Delaware can serve two four - year terms . </P> <P> At present , 36 states have term limits of various types for their governors . To circumvent the term limit in Alabama incumbent governor George Wallace pushed through the nomination of his wife Lurleen , in the 1966 Democratic primary , which was , in those days , the real contest in Alabama . It was generally understood that Mrs. Wallace would only be a titular governor while her husband continued to hold the real power . She won the election , but only served 16 months before dying in 1968 . </P> <P> As indicated above , in fifteen state legislatures the members serve in rotation , i.e. , under term limits enacted during the reforms of the early 1990s . In another six states , however , state legislatures have either overturned their own limits or state supreme courts have ruled such limits unconstitutional . In 2002 the Idaho Legislature became the first legislature of its kind to repeal its own term limits , enacted by a public vote in 1994 , ostensibly because it applied to local officials along with the legislature . </P> <H3> Gubernatorial term limits ( edit ) </H3> U.S. gubernatorial term limits as of 2014 <Table> <Tr> <Td> No limit No limit , two - year terms One ; reeligible after four years </Td> <Td> Two ; reeligible after four years Two ; eligible 8 out of 12 years Two ; eligible 8 out of 16 years Two , absolute </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> Governors of 36 states and four territories are subject to various term limits , while the governors of 14 states , Puerto Rico , and the Mayor of Washington , D.C. , may serve an unlimited number of terms . Each state 's gubernatorial term limits are prescribed by its state constitution , with the exception of Wyoming , whose limits are found in its statutes . Territorial term limits are prescribed by its constitution in the Northern Mariana Islands , the Organic Acts in Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands , and by statute in American Samoa . </P> <P> Unique in its restriction , Virginia prohibits its governors from succeeding themselves for a second term , although former governors are reeligible after four years out of office . Many other states formerly had this prohibition , but all had eliminated it by 2000 . </P> <P> The governors of the following states and territories are limited to two consecutive terms , but are reeligible after four years out of office : Alabama , Alaska , Arizona , Colorado , Florida , Georgia , Hawaii , Kansas , Kentucky , Louisiana , Maine , Maryland , Nebraska , New Jersey , New Mexico , North Carolina , Ohio , Pennsylvania , Rhode Island , South Carolina , South Dakota , Tennessee , West Virginia , American Samoa , Guam , and the U.S. Virgin Islands . Equivalently , the Governors of Indiana and Oregon are limited to serving 8 out of any 12 years . Conversely , the Governors of Montana and Wyoming are restricted to two terms , limited to serving 8 out of any 16 years . Finally , the governors of the following states and territory are absolutely limited ( for life ) to two terms : Arkansas , California , Delaware , Michigan , Mississippi , Missouri , Nevada , the Northern Mariana Islands , and Oklahoma . The current Governor of California ( Jerry Brown ) is , however , serving a fourth ( non-consecutive ) term because his first two terms were before limits were passed in California , and the limits did not apply to individuals ' prior terms . </P> <P> The governors of New Hampshire and Vermont may serve unlimited two - year terms . The governors ( or equivalent ) in the following states , district , and territory may serve unlimited four - year terms : Connecticut , Idaho , Illinois , Iowa , Massachusetts , Minnesota , New York , North Dakota , Texas , Utah , Washington , Wisconsin , District of Columbia , and Puerto Rico .

( For legislators first elected on or before June 5 , 2012 , the previous limits ( enacted in 1990 ) of either three two - year terms for Assembly members ( six years ) and two four - year terms for Senate members ( eight years ) apply ) . </Li> <Li> Colorado General Assembly : four consecutive two - year terms in the House ( eight years ) and two consecutive four - year terms in the Senate ( eight years ) . </Li> <Li> Florida Legislature : may serve no more than eight consecutive years in either house .

See term limits in Oregon . </Li> <Li> Utah State Legislature : the Legislature repealed its own term limits in 2003 . </Li> <Li> Washington State Legislature : the Washington Supreme Court voided term limits in 1998 . </Li> <Li> Wyoming Legislature : the Wyoming Supreme Court ruled term limits unconstitutional in 2004 . See term limits in Wyoming . </Li> </Ul> <H2> Municipal term limits ( edit ) </H2> <P> Some local governments have term limits . In Philadelphia , the mayor can not be elected three consecutive times , but there is no limit on how long any individual can serve as mayor . Frank Rizzo was elected mayor in 1971 and 1975 ; he attempted to repeal the term limit , but failed and could not run in 1979 . He ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic nomination for mayor in 1983 but he lost to Wilson Goode . In 1986 , he switched to the Republican Party , and ran as a Republican in the mayoral elections of 1987 and 1991 . </P> <P> Limits vary from city to city even within the same state . For example , Houston , Texas , has a limit of 2 four - year terms ( prior to November 3 , 2015 , 3 two - year terms dating back to 1991 ) , while San Antonio , Texas , has a limit of 4 two - year terms . Both Houston and San Antonio 's term limits are absolute ; elected officeholders are ineligible to run for the same position where seeking higher office is common . </P> <P> A two - term limit was imposed on New York City Council members and citywide elected officials ( except for district attorneys ) in New York City after a 1993 referendum ( see the Charter of the City of New York , \u00a7 1138 ) . On November 3 , 2008 , however , when Michael Bloomberg was in his second term of mayor , the City Council approved the extension of the two - term limit to a three - term limit ; one year later , he was elected to a third term . The two - term limit was reinstated after a referendum in 2010 . </P> <P> In Los Angeles the mayor serves up to two four - year terms since 1993 , while the City Council serve up to three four - year terms . </P> <P> In Cincinnati , Ohio , the term limit for mayor is two successive four - year terms . Council members are limited to two successive four - year terms . There is no limit to total terms that may be served , just a limit on successive terms . </P> <P> In New Orleans , City Council members are limited to two four - year terms . However , a council member representing one of the five council districts may run for one of the two at - large seats on the council once they reach the two - term limit , and vice versa . There is no limit on the number of terms a council member may serve in a lifetime . Since 1954 , the mayor of New Orleans has been limited to two consecutive four - year elected terms , but he or she may be elected again after sitting out one four - year term . When the new city plan of government was adopted , the mayor at the time , DeLesseps Story Morrison , was exempt from term limits due to a grandfather clause . </P> <P> Under the original Metropolitan Charter adopted in 1962 , the mayor of Nashville was limited to three consecutive four - year terms , which was subsequently reduced to two consecutive four - year terms in 1991 . Councilors were likewise limited to two consecutive four - year terms , but subsequent court rulings have determined the offices of district councilor and at - large councilor to be separate offices even though all councilors serve together in one unicameral body , which has meant that at large councilors have continued in office as district members , and ( more frequently ) district councilors have been elected to subsequent terms as at large councilors . </P> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Notes of Debates in the Federal Convention of 1787 </Li> <Li> List of political term limits </Li> <Li> Political class </Li> <Li> Second Constitutional Convention of the United States </Li> </Ul> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> ^ Jump up to : Professor Garrett G.

Their integrity may be proof against improper considerations immediately addressed to themselves , but they are apt to acquire a habit of looking with indifference upon the public interests and of tolerating conduct from which an unpracticed man would revolt . Office is considered as a species of property , and government rather as a means of promoting individual interests than as an instrument created solely for the service of the people . Corruption in some and in others a perversion of correct feelings and principles divert government from its legitimate ends and make it an engine for the support of the few at the expense of the many .
