He was portrayed by late Australian actor Heath Ledger . Ledger 's interpretation of the character is specifically influenced by the graphic novels Batman : The Killing Joke and Arkham Asylum : A Serious House on Serious Earth . In the film , he wears the character 's traditional color palette , while his facial appearance includes clown makeup that covers facial scars of a Glasgow smile . </P> <P> The film 's interpretation of the Joker embodies themes of chaos , anarchy and obsession : Throughout the film , the character expresses a desire to upset social order through crime , and defines himself by his conflict with Batman . The character also explores techniques found in Ledger 's previous performances , including his clown act in Terry Gilliam 's fantasy film The Brothers Grimm . Further , it references paintings by artist Francis Bacon , Anthony Burgess ' novel A Clockwork Orange and various punk rock musicians . </P> <P> The Joker is considered Ledger 's finest performance ; he himself regarded it as his most enjoyable . When the film was released in July 2008 , six months after the actor had died from an accidental prescription drug overdose , the performance caused a sensation and received universal acclaim and numerous posthumous accolades , including the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Fictional character biography <Ul> <Li> 1.1 The Dark Knight </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 Background </Li> <Li> 3 Performance <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Description </Li> <Li> 3.2 Development </Li> <Li> 3.3 Execution <Ul> <Li> 3.3. 1 Effects of Heath Ledger 's death </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Reception and legacy <Ul> <Li> 4.1 Announcement and early response </Li> <Li> 4.2 Critical reception </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 5 See also </Li> <Li> 6 References </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Fictional character biography ( edit ) </H2> <H3> The Dark Knight ( edit ) </H3> Main article : The Dark Knight ( film ) <P> The Joker appears in The Dark Knight ( 2008 ) . In the film 's first scene , he and five accomplices , all wearing clown masks , rob a mob - owned bank . He tricks four of them into killing each other , then kills the last one himself and escapes with the money . Interrupting a videoconference between mob leaders Sal Maroni ( Eric Roberts ) , the Chechen ( Ritchie Coster ) and Gambol ( Michael Jai White ) with their accountant Lau ( Chin Han ) , he offers to kill Batman for half of the mob 's money . Gambol refuses the offer and puts a bounty on the `` clown '' . Later , the Joker kills Gambol and takes over his gang . </P> <P> After learning that Batman ( Christian Bale ) has retrieved Lau , Maroni and the Chechen accept the Joker 's offer . The Joker announces that people will die each day until Batman reveals his true identity , and makes good on his threat by murdering Gotham Police Commissioner Gillian B. Loeb ( Colin McFarlane ) and mob trial Judge Janet Surillo ( Nydia Rodriguez Terracina ) . When Gotham 's district attorney , Harvey Dent ( Aaron Eckhart ) , attempts to draw him out by identifying himself as Batman , the Joker tries to kidnap him , only to be arrested . Batman interrogates him after Dent goes missing . The Joker also reveals that Dent 's girlfriend ( and Bruce Wayne 's childhood sweetheart ) Rachel Dawes ( Maggie Gyllenhaal ) has also gone missing and reveals their separate locations , both rigged up to time bombs . Switching their whereabouts , the Joker tricks Batman into saving Dent , who is disfigured in the explosion , while Rachel is killed . The Joker then escapes the police station with Lau , who had previously fled to Hong Kong only to be captured by Batman . </P> <P> The Joker kills Lau and the Chechen , burns his half of the mob 's money , and takes over the Chechen 's gang . Then , to prevent Wayne Enterprises M&A law accountant Coleman Reese ( Joshua Harto ) from revealing Batman 's alter ego on TV , he announces that he will blow up a hospital if Reese is not dead within 60 minutes . During the panic , the Joker sneaks into Gotham General Hospital disguised as a nurse to meet with Dent , and persuades him to take revenge on the people he holds responsible for Rachel 's death . He then blows up the hospital and takes a busload of hostages . He rigs explosives on two of the ferries separately containing citizens and criminals and tells the passengers that he will destroy both boats unless one blows up the other . Ultimately , however , the hostages choose not to blow each other up . Batman subsequently apprehends the Joker , who states that neither will kill each other and believes that they are meant to fight each other forever . The Joker gloats that he has won `` the battle for Gotham 's soul '' , as the city 's inhabitants will lose hope once Dent 's rampage as the murderous vigilante `` Two - Face '' become known . The Joker is then taken into custody as he laughs hysterically . Batman ultimately foils the Joker 's plan by taking the blame for Dent 's crimes . </P> <H2> Background ( edit ) </H2> `` ... I feel like this is an opportunity for me to not take myself too seriously , and for some reason I just gravitated towards ( The Joker ) and I knew I had something to give to him . And I just instantly had an idea of how to do it . '' -- Heath Ledger on why he preferred playing the super-villain . <P> As a starting actor , Heath Ledger did not attach himself seriously to the roles he was playing . This changed , however , when at age 22 he started to watch some of his films . Realizing that they were movies he himself might not actually have wanted to see , it made him more cautious and respectful towards his professional choices . The 2005 fantasy film The Brothers Grimm marked a turning point for the actor as director Terry Gilliam gave Ledger ( and his co-star , Matt Damon ) opportunities to create characters they had not been given before . Gilliam helped Ledger put on a clown act for that film , an experience the actor later acknowledged as an influence for his performance as the Joker . </P> <P> Director Christopher Nolan had met with Ledger over the years for different roles . While meeting for the part of Batman in Batman Begins , Ledger explained that he was not interested in working on such a film . The actor reflected on his problems with portraying superheroes , saying ; `` I would just feel stupid and silly . I could n't pull it off and there are other people who can perfectly , but I just could n't take myself seriously . '' However , later impressed with Batman Begins , Ledger sought the part of the Joker from Nolan . Impressed with Ledger 's determination , Nolan cast him in the part . `` Heath was just ready to do it , he was ready to do something that big . '' Casting director John Papsidera reflected on the casting choice , saying the filmmakers knew they needed somebody courageous to play the part . Heath Ledger was cast before there was a script . </P> <H2> Performance ( edit ) </H2> <P> Heath Ledger described the Joker as a `` psychopathic , mass murdering , schizophrenic clown with zero empathy . '' Highlighting the opportunity for freshness , the actor aimed for a new and different interpretation of the character , separate from previous film incarnations . </P> <P> Ledger and Christopher Nolan both explained seeing eye - to - eye on the Joker 's appearance in the film , sharing common reference points for who the character was going to be . Based on philosophical ideas of anarchy and chaos , they looked at art by Francis Bacon for visual reference and they talked about Malcolm McDowell 's performance as Alex in Stanley Kubrick 's film A Clockwork Orange , and who Alex is in Anthony Burgess 's novel of the same name . Ledger was given Alan Moore 's graphic novel Batman : The Killing Joke for preparation for the role , as well as Grant Morrison 's graphic novel Arkham Asylum : A Serious House on Serious Earth , which the actor `` really tried to read and put it down '' . In an interview with MTV , Ledger said he regarded the experience playing the Joker as the most fun he ever had , `` and probably will ever have '' . </P> <H3> Description ( edit ) </H3> `` Everything about what he does from every gesture , every little facial tick , everything he 's doing with his voice -- it all speaks to the heart of this character . It all speaks to this idea of a character who 's devoted to a concept of pure anarchy and chaos . It 's hard to get a handle on how those elements combine . The physicality reminds me of the great silent comedians . It has a bit of ( Buster ) Keaton and ( Charlie ) Chaplin about it . '' -- Christopher Nolan on Ledger 's performance . <P> Wearing the character 's traditional color palette , the Joker is dressed with a thin tie and a green waistcoat , topped by a purple overcoat . relating to a feel to New Romanticism . His shoes have an upward swoop at the toe , reminiscent to clown shoes . He carries no identification of any kind and offers no clear details about his true name or background ; when he is arrested by the Gotham City police , they find only knives and lint in his pockets . </P> <P> The Joker 's hair is stringy , unkempt , and dyed green . His face is covered in a cracked and runny layer of white clown makeup , with his eyes thickly rimmed in black . A sloppy red grin is painted on the Glasgow smile beneath the makeup , extending from the mouth to the cheeks . Film critic Peter Travers wrote about the Joker as having `` grungy hair and yellow teeth of a hound fresh out of hell '' . </P> <P> The character 's mannerisms carry a quality of unpredictability . His voice frequently shifts in pitch , so that he speaks his dialogue hitting higher notes , followed by an immediate lower voice capable of landing two octaves below . Nolan acknowledges this unpredictability to be part of the character 's slinky physical movements as well , saying that Ledger 's performance `` ( is ) always a surprise '' . About the Joker 's physical appearance , Geoff Boucher wrote for the Los Angeles Times that the character probes the facial scars with his tongue and `` walks with shoulders bowed and his chin out and down , like a hyena '' . </P> <H3> Development ( edit ) </H3> <P> Steve Alexander , Heath Ledger 's agent , said the actor had a `` pay - or - play '' deal on The Dark Knight , `` so he felt free to do whatever he wanted to do as the Joker , no matter how crazy . '' According to The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus cinematographer Nicola Pecorini , Ledger had talked with him about Johnny Depp 's off - kilter portrayal in Pirates of the Caribbean in relation to The Dark Knight , aiming to make a performance that would be `` so far out he 'd be fired . '' As Ledger was cast early in pre-production , Nolan explained that the actor had `` months and months '' to prepare for the role . </P> `` Inside . He 's laughing red and black and red and black till there 's nothing left to laugh . Until , almost tenderly , he turns inside out through his mouth . '' -- Scrawlings from Heath Ledger 's Joker diary <P> During a span of six weeks , Ledger `` locked '' himself away in a hotel room , forming a character diary and experimenting with voices . `` It 's a combination of reading all the comic books I could that were relevant to the script and then just closing my eyes and meditating on it , '' he said about his process . The diary contains scrawling and cuttings inside . Christopher Hooton , writing for The Independent , said that the ' Joker journal ' had several stills from Stanley Kubrick 's film A Clockwork Orange , joker cards , photos of hyenas , unhinged clown makeup and the word `` chaos '' highlighted in green . Furthermore , it contains a list of things the Joker would find funny , such as AIDS , landmines , and geniuses suffering brain damage . It was revealed that Ledger had read Grant Morrison 's writing of The Clown at Midnight ( Batman # 663 ) and based the list upon the Batman writer 's prose . </P> <P> Ledger highlighted the importance of finding an iconic voice and laugh for the character , relating the voice as `` the key to the demented killer . '' Nolan explained Ledger 's early and `` peculiar '' ambition for the voice of the character , saying that the actor had studied the way ventriloquist dummies talk . The filmmaker also acknowledged that the voice performance was based on the Alexander technique . </P> <P> Ledger developed the Joker 's voice and mannerism slowly over time and during camera tests . `` Do n't act , just read it '' , Nolan had told Ledger for test screening . In hair and makeup tests , Ledger would start exploring the movements of the character . While test recording without sound , he shared his take on the Joker 's voice and moves , and `` in that way he sort of sneaked up on it . '' </P> <P> The actor developed the physical appearance of the character , being `` very involved '' with the painting of his face , says prosthetic supervisor Conor O'Sullivan . O'Sullivan acknowledged how Ledger , Nolan and makeup artist John Caglione all gravitated towards a Francis Bacon painting Nolan was referring to . Ledger also got to choose the Joker 's weapon among different rubber knives , and he worked closely with costume designer Lindy Hemming on deciding the look for the character . </P> <P> Nolan noted , `` We gave a Francis Bacon spin to ( his face ) . This corruption , this decay in the texture of the look itself . It 's grubby . You can almost imagine what he smells like . '' With costume designer Lindy Hemming picking inspiration for the `` chaotic '' look from such countercultural pop culture artists as Iggy Pop , Johnny Rotten , and Sid Vicious . She gave the image for the Joker of someone who is `` very sweaty '' and who `` probably does n't have a proper home . '' She tried to present a backstory for the character `` that he really does n't look after himself . '' </P> <H3> Execution ( edit ) </H3> <P> Application of Heath Ledger 's makeup was done with the actor scrunching special facial expressions . Caglione called the application work `` a dance '' . This technique created facial textures for the white paint . As Ledger closed his eyes tight , Caglione put on the black makeup . Then , water was sprayed over the eyes and the actor would squeeze his eyes and shake his head and `` all that black drippy , smudgy stuff would happen '' . </P> <P> To get in character for filming , Ledger used his Joker diary which he carried with him on set . Between takes , Heath Ledger stayed out of character even as he wore the character costume , just being himself . The actor would goof around , skateboarding while in his Joker costume on set , and smoking cigarettes . John Caglione described Ledger as helping others around to relax , never letting `` the intense nature of the roles overwhelm him . '' </P> <P> The first sequence shot was the films IMAX opening , the `` prologue '' . As the Joker wears a mask through the scene with minimal dialogue , Nolan set the prologue first in schedule because he wanted to put off performance worries , allowing Ledger to enjoy that relief . </P> <P> The interrogation scene between Batman and the Joker was the first scene shot with Ledger really showing the full performance all together . The director and his leading actors all liked the idea of shooting the key scene early on . During rehearsals , the actors kept things loose and improvisational , saving for the actual shoot . Bale confirmed that Ledger did not perform the Joker 's voice during rehearsals , waiting to get in character when the cameras rolled . Nolan later acknowledged the scene to be his favorite in the film , saying `` I had never seen anybody sell a punch the way Heath was able to do with Christian . '' </P> <P> Ledger was allowed to shoot and direct the threat videos the Joker sends out as warnings . Each take Ledger made was different from the last . Nolan was impressed enough with the first video shoot that he chose to not be present when Ledger shot the video with a kidnapped reporter ( Anthony Michael Hall ) . </P> <P> Heath Ledger always showed up early on set . The first thing he would do , according to Caglione , was to give bear hugs to cast and crew members around the set . `` And no matter how banged - up or bruised Heath was after a long day , after we 'd take off the last drop of makeup , he 'd just hug everybody in the trailer before he left '' . At the end of shooting , on his Joker diary 's final page , Ledger wrote `` BYE BYE '' . </P> Effects of Heath Ledger 's death ( edit ) <P> On January 22 , 2008 , after he had completed filming The Dark Knight , Ledger died , aged only 28 , of an accidental prescription drug overdose , leading to intense press attention and memorial tributes . `` It was tremendously emotional , right when he passed , having to go back in and look at him every day ( during editing ) , '' Nolan recalled . `` But the truth is , I feel very lucky to have something productive to do , to have a performance that he was very , very proud of , and that he had entrusted to me to finish . '' All of Ledger 's scenes appear as he completed them in the filming ; in editing the film , Nolan added no `` digital effects '' to alter Ledger 's actual performance posthumously . Nolan has dedicated the film in part to Ledger 's memory . </P> <P> Ledger 's death affected the marketing campaign for The Dark Knight and also both the production and marketing of Terry Gilliam 's film The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus ; both Nolan and Gilliam celebrated and paid tribute to Ledger 's work in these films . </P> <H2> Reception and legacy ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Announcement and early response ( edit ) </H3> <P> On July 31 , 2006 , The Dark Knight was officially announced by Warner Bros with the casting of Heath Ledger as the Joker . The casting decision surprised others , and was seen as a controversial move at the time , receiving notable negative reactions on the internet . Nolan remembered the cynicism he endured surrounding Ledger 's casting , saying that `` the whole world turned around and said ' What are you doing ? ' You know , Heath Ledger , Joker , did n't make any sense to people at all . '' </P> <P> However , with the first trailer released in 2007 , the film and its portrayal of the Joker received very positive response from audiences and entertainment industry professionals alike . Mexican filmmaker Guillermo del Toro gushed of his impression for Ledger 's performance , finding it `` really , really edgy and scary . '' American Batman writers Paul Dini and Jeph Loeb both chimed with the positive reactions . Loeb , otherwise critical of Nicholson 's portrayal of the character , expressed his excitement for Ledger 's interpretation , saying the casting felt `` just about right . I eagerly anticipate more ! '' </P> <H3> Critical reception ( edit ) </H3> `` Heath Ledger is magnificent . The Joker , incarnated with chilling authority by the actor , is simply one of the most twisted and mesmerizing creeps in movie history . '' -- Richard Corliss , Time <P> Heath Ledger 's portrayal of the Joker received critical acclaim , winning numerous posthumous awards for his performance , including the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor , a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor in a Motion Picture , the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role , the Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor , a Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Supporting Role , and a Best Actor International Award at the 2008 Australian Film Institute Awards . </P> <P> `` I can only speak superlatives of Ledger , who is mad - crazy - brilliant as the Joker '' , wrote Peter Travers of Rolling Stone , stating that the film is deeper than its predecessor , with a `` deft '' script that refuses to scrutinize the Joker with popular psychology . Travers praised the cast , saying each brings his or her `` ' A ' game '' to the film . '' Travers said Ledger moves the Joker away from Jack Nicholson 's interpretation into darker territory , and expresses his support for any potential campaign to have Ledger nominated for an Academy Award , </P> <P> Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun - Times stated that Heath Ledger 's portrayal is a `` key performance '' and pondered whether he would become the first posthumous Academy Award - winning actor since Peter Finch in 1976 . </P> <P> Mark Dinning from Empire magazine called Ledger 's performance `` monumental '' and wrote `` The Dark Knight is Ledger 's movie . It is a towering performance ... A force of f * cking nature '' . Kevin Smith commented on Ledger , calling his `` incredible '' performance `` the most frightening , smart and well - played villains ever . Ever . '' Mark Lee , writing for The Daily Telegraph , commented that Ledger accomplished `` a genuinely unsettling , brilliant nuanced portrait of evil '' . Tim Teeman commented for The Times that `` Ledger is so terrifying and unpredictable that his very presence on screen makes you nervous . '' Total Film reviewed that Ledger is `` burning brightly as he embodies an icon ... This is the definitive Joker '' , calling the performance `` a masterpiece '' . For The Hollywood Reporter , Kirk Honeycutt called Ledger 's performance `` a beauty . '' \\ Entertainment Weekly put the film on its end - of - the - decade , `` best - of '' list , saying , `` Every great hero needs a great villain . And in 2008 , Christian Bale 's Batman found his in Heath Ledger 's demented dervish , the Joker . '' Emanuel Levy wrote Ledger `` throws himself completely '' into the role . David Denby of The New Yorker , otherwise critical of the film , praised Ledger 's `` sinister and frightening '' performance , which he says is the film 's one element of success . Denby called Ledger `` mesmerising '' and said , `` His performance is a heroic , unsettling final act : this young actor looked into the abyss . '' `` It 's just one of the most iconic movie performances of modern times , '' declared chief film critic of Variety Scott Foundas . </P> <P> Film critics , co-stars Maggie Gyllenhaal and Michael Caine , and many of Ledger 's colleagues in the film community joined Bale in calling for and predicting a nomination for the 2008 Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor in recognition of Ledger 's performance in The Dark Knight . </P> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> 2000s portal </Li> </Ul> <Ul> <Li> Joker in other media </Li> <Li> Barack Obama `` Joker '' poster </Li> </Ul> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> ^ Jump up to : Collura , Scott .
