His mother , Eva , once a successful travel writer , lives alone in a rundown house and works in a travel agency near the prison , where she visits Kevin . She looks back at her memories of him growing up as she tries to cope with the hostility of her neighbors . </P> <P> Kevin is detached and difficult from childhood . He appears to loathe and deliberately antagonize Eva , and she has trouble bonding with him . As a baby , he cries incessantly , but only around her ; as a child , he resists toilet training , rebuffs Eva 's attempts at affection , and shows no interest in anything . He behaves like a happy , loving son when his father Franklin is watching . Eva 's frustration drives her to throw Kevin against the wall , breaking his arm . Kevin tells Franklin he fell , using the incident to blackmail Eva into doing what he wants . </P> <P> Franklin dismisses Eva 's concerns and makes excuses for Kevin 's behavior . When Kevin is confined to bed with a fever , Eva reads him a book about Robin Hood ; when Robin competes in Prince John 's archery contest , Kevin shows Eva affection for the first time . Franklin gives him a bow and arrow and teaches him archery . </P> <P> Eva and Franklin have a second child , Celia , who is lively and cheerful . However , Kevin is disdainful and jealous . A few years later , Celia 's pet guinea pig is killed and she is blinded in one eye by caustic cleaning fluid . Eva is suspicious , but Franklin insists that Kevin is not to blame . Eva 's suspicion ruins their marriage and she and Franklin divorce . Eva comes to fear her son , as she sees growing evidence of Kevin 's sadism . </P> <P> As a teenager , Kevin locks several students in the school gymnasium and murders them with his bow . When Eva arrives home , she finds Kevin has murdered Franklin and Celia . On the second anniversary of the massacre , Eva visits Kevin in prison . Eva asks him why he committed the murders . Kevin , who is about to be transferred to an adult prison , responds that he used to think he knew but is no longer sure . Eva hugs Kevin and walks away sadly . </P> <H2> Cast ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Tilda Swinton as Eva Khatchadourian </Li> <Li> John C. Reilly as Franklin Plaskett </Li> <Li> Ezra Miller as Kevin Khatchadourian <Ul> <Li> Jasper Newell as young Kevin </Li> <Li> Rocky Duer as infant Kevin </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> Ashley Gerasimovich as Celia Khatchadourian </Li> <Li> Siobhan Fallon Hogan as Wanda </Li> <Li> Alex Manette as Colin </Li> </Ul> <H2> Development ( edit ) </H2> <P> In 2005 BBC Films acquired the rights to adapt the book as a film . Executive producers Paula Jalfon and Christine Langan took it through the development stage , and were joined by executive producer Steven Soderbergh . </P> <P> Lynne Ramsay , who became available after her involvement in the film adaptation of The Lovely Bones came to an end , signed on to direct , and was working on a script with In the Bedroom writer Robert Festinger by 2006 . Shriver was offered a consultative role in the production process but declined , stating she had `` had it up to ( her ) eyeballs with that book , '' though she did express concern for how the film would capture Eva 's role as the unreliable narrator . Production had not begun by 2007 , though BBC Films renewed the adaptation rights early in the year . In an interview with The Herald in September 2007 , Shriver stated that she had not been in contact with Ramsay about the film for over two years . Ramsay 's spokesperson told the newspaper that a new script draft was being prepared and , at the time the interview was published , had not been submitted to the producers . Michael Clayton producer Jennifer Fox joined the production team in 2008 ; the film was expected to begin shooting that year . The script appeared on the 2008 Brit List , a film - industry - compiled list of the best unproduced screenplays in British film . Ramsay 's partner Rory Stewart Kinnear also contributed to the final shooting script . </P> <P> Christine Langan told the London Evening Standard in February 2010 that the long delay in production had been caused by BBC Films having difficulty funding the high budget ; Ramsay rewrote the script so the film could be made for a lower cost . The UK Film Council awarded \u00a3 18,510 to the production from its development fund in the same month . Financial backing was also provided by Footprint Investments LLP , Caemhan Partnership LLP and Lipsync Productions , and production is in association with Artina Films and Forward Films . </P> <P> Filming commenced on 19 April 2010 on location in Stamford , Connecticut , and concluded on 28 May 2010 . A key filming location was J.M. Wright Technical High School in Stamford . Jonny Greenwood of the band Radiohead composed the film 's score . </P> <H2> Release ( edit ) </H2> <P> In October 2009 , IFC Films picked up the rights to international sales , and made pre-sales at the American Film Market . Artificial Eye distributed the film in the UK from 21 October 2011 . Oscilloscope Laboratories distributed the film theatrically in North America in the winter of 2011 . </P> <P> The film premiered In Competition at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival , where it was met with praise from film critics . </P> <P> We Need to Talk About Kevin opened in a limited release in North America in a single theater and grossed $24,587 , ranking 53rd at the box office . The film ended up earning $1,738,692 in America , and $5,754,934 internationally , for a total of $7,493,626 . </P> <P> We Need to Talk About Kevin was released on Blu - ray and DVD on 29 May 2012 . </P> <H2> Reception ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Critical response ( edit ) </H3> <P> We Need to Talk About Kevin received positive reviews . The film currently holds an approval rating of 76 % on Rotten Tomatoes ; the site 's consensus reads , `` We Need to Talk About Kevin is a masterful blend of drama and horror , with fantastic performances across the board ( Tilda Swinton especially , delivering one of her very best ) . '' On Metacritic , the film received a score of 68 out of 100 based on 37 critics , indicating `` generally favorable reviews . '' </P> <P> Chicago Sun - Times critic Roger Ebert gave it 4 out of 4 stars and said , `` As a portrait of a deteriorating state of mind , We Need to Talk About Kevin is a masterful film . '' </P> <P> British film critic Mark Kermode of BBC Radio 5 Live named We Need to Talk About Kevin as the Best Film of 2011 . </P> <P> Richard Brody , in The New Yorker , wrote that it `` masquerades as a psychological puzzle but is essentially a horror film full of decorous sensationalism . '' He opined that the film exploited but did not explore the fascination that `` bad seed '' children exert . </P> <P> Jake Martin , a Jesuit priest and movie critic , wrote in his review in Busted Halo that the film is not `` yet another installment in the pantheon of post-modern films intent upon assaulting the human desire to give meaning to the world . '' Instead , he says , `` We Need to Talk About Kevin in fact needs to be talked about , as what it is attempting to do by marrying the darkest , most nihilistic components of contemporary cinema with a redemptive message is groundbreaking . '' </P> <P> Tilda Swinton was nominated for a number of acting awards , including a Golden Globe Award , Screen Actors Guild and BAFTA for Best Actress in a leading role . Her acting also received praise by film critic David Thomson in a review of the film for The New Republic . </P> <H3> Awards and nominations ( edit ) </H3> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Award </Th> <Th> Date of ceremony </Th> <Th> </Th> <Th> Nominee ( s ) </Th> <Th> Result </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Austin Film Critics Association </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> Best Actress </Td> <Td> Tilda Swinton </Td> <Td> Won </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> AACTA International Award </Td> <Td> 27 January 2012 </Td> <Td> Best Actress </Td> <Td> Nominated </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Best Direction </Td> <Td> Lynne Ramsay </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Best Film </Td> <Td> Jennifer Fox , Luc Roeg , Bob Salerno </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Best Screenplay </Td> <Td> Lynne Ramsay , Rory Stewart Kinnear </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> BAFTA Award </Td> <Td> 12 February 2012 </Td> <Td> Best Director </Td> <Td> Lynne Ramsay </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Best Actress in a Leading Role </Td> <Td> Tilda Swinton </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Outstanding British Film </Td> <Td> Jennifer Fox , Rory Stewart Kinnear , Lynne Ramsay , Luc Roeg , Robert Salerno </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Bodil Award </Td> <Td> 16 March 2013 </Td> <Td> Best American Film </Td> <Td> Lynne Ramsay </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> British Independent Film Award </Td> <Td> 4 December 2011 </Td> <Td> Best Director </Td> <Td> Won </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Best Actress </Td> <Td> Tilda Swinton </Td> <Td> Nominated </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Best British Independent Film </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Best Screenplay </Td> <Td> Lynne Ramsay , Rory Stewart Kinnear </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Best Supporting Actor </Td> <Td> Ezra Miller </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Best Technical Achievement ( for cinematography ) </Td> <Td> Seamus McGarvey </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Cannes Film Festival </Td> <Td> 11 -- 22 May 2011 </Td> <Td> Palme d'Or </Td> <Td> Lynne Ramsay </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Critics ' Choice Movie Awards </Td> <Td> 12 January 2012 </Td> <Td> Best Actress </Td> <Td> Tilda Swinton </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Best Young Actor / Actress </Td> <Td> Ezra Miller </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Dallas -
