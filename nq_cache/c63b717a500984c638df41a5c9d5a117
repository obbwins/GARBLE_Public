It was replaced by the current policy of land restitution . The act decreed that whites were not allowed to buy land from natives and vice versa . That stopped white farmers from buying more native land . Exceptions had to be approved by the Governor - General . The native areas left initially totaled less than 10 % of the entire land mass of the Union , which was later expanded to 13 % . </P> <P> The Act further prohibited the practice of serfdom or sharecropping . It also protected existing agreements or arrangement of land hired or leased by both parties . </P> <P> This land was in `` native reserve '' areas , which meant it was under `` communal '' tenure vested in African chiefs : it could not be bought , sold or used as surety . Outside such areas , perhaps of even greater significance for black farming was that the Act forbade black tenant farming on white - owned land . Since so many black farmers were sharecroppers or labor tenants , that had a devastating effect , but its full implementation was not immediate . The Act strengthened the chiefs , who were part of the state administration , but it forced many blacks into the `` white '' areas into wage labour . </P> <H2> Impact ( edit ) </H2> <P> The Act created a system of land tenure that deprived most South Africans of the right to own land . That had major socio - economic repercussions . Had the Supreme Court of South Africa not rendered the Act 's application void for a few years , it also would have disenfranchised all `` natives '' in the Cape Colony , where blacks and people of mixed race ( Cape Coloureds ) had greater political rights than in the other provinces as a legacy of British rule . It had a property ( and education ) - based franchise . The Act continued in force 40 years . </P> <P> The opposition was modest but vocal . John Dube used his newspaper to create an issue . As president of what would become the African National Congress , he supported whites like William Cullen Wilcox , who had created the Zululand Industrial Improvement Company . That had led to them supplying land to thousands of black people in Natal . Dube was one of five people who were sent to Britain to try and overturn the law once it came into force in South Africa . </P> <P> Sol Plaatje traveled to Britain with the SANNC ( later the African National Congress ) to protest the Natives Land Act but to no avail . He collected transcripts of court deliberations on the Natives Land Act and testimonies from those directly subject to the act in the 1916 book Native Life in South Africa . </P> <H2> Political ironies ( edit ) </H2> <P> Much political irony surrounded the Act : </P> <Ul> <Li> The minister at the time of its introduction , J.W. Sauer , was a Cape Liberal who opposed disenfranchisement of blacks . He , however , advocated for `` separate residential areas for Whites and Natives '' in the Parliamentary debate on the bill . </Li> <Li> John Tengo Jabavu , a prominent `` educated African '' welcomed the Act , but Merriman and Schreiner opposed the Act on principle . </Li> </Ul> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> History of South Africa ( 1910 -- 1948 ) </Li> <Li> South Africa under apartheid </Li> </Ul> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ `` 19 June 1913 Native Land Act '' , This day in history , publish date unknown ( accessed 20 December 2007 ) . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Collins , Robert O. and James M.
