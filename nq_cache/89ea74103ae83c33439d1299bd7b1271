It has free admission and is open 364 days a year . In 2016 , with 7.1 million visitors , it was the fourth most visited museum in the world and the most visited natural - history museum in the world . Opened in 1910 , the museum on the National Mall was one of the first Smithsonian buildings constructed exclusively to hold the national collections and research facilities . The main building has an overall area of 1,500,000 square feet ( 140,000 m ) with 325,000 square feet ( 30,200 m ) of exhibition and public space and houses over 1,000 employees . </P> <P> The museum 's collections contain over 126 million specimens of plants , animals , fossils , minerals , rocks , meteorites , human remains , and human cultural artifacts . In 2016 it was the second most visited of all of the Smithsonian museums . It is also home to about 185 professional natural - history scientists -- the largest group of scientists dedicated to the study of natural and cultural history in the world . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 History <Ul> <Li> 1.1 1846 -- 1911 </Li> <Li> 1.2 1981 -- 2003 </Li> <Li> 1.3 2003 -- 2007 </Li> <Li> 1.4 2007 -- 2012 </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 Research and collections </Li> <Li> 3 Exhibitions <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Hall of Geology , Gems , and Minerals </Li> <Li> 3.2 Hall of Human Origins </Li> <Li> 3.3 Dinosaurs / Hall of Paleobiology </Li> <Li> 3.4 Hall of Mammals </Li> <Li> 3.5 Insect Zoo </Li> <Li> 3.6 Ocean Hall </Li> <Li> 3.7 African Voices </Li> <Li> 3.8 Butterflies + Plants : Partners In Evolution </Li> <Li> 3.9 Western Cultures Hall </Li> <Li> 3.10 Korea Gallery </Li> <Li> 3.11 Teleology : Hall of Bones </Li> <Li> 3.12 Q ? rius </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Other </Li> <Li> 5 Gallery </Li> <Li> 6 In popular culture </Li> <Li> 7 References </Li> <Li> 8 Bibliography </Li> <Li> 9 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> History ( edit ) </H2> <H3> 1846 -- 1911 ( edit ) </H3> <P> The United States National Museum was founded in 1846 as part of the Smithsonian Institution . The museum was initially housed in the Smithsonian Institution Building , which is better known today as the Smithsonian Castle . A formal exhibit hall opened in 1858 . The growing collection led to the construction of a new building , the National Museum Building ( known today as the Arts and Industries Building ) . Covering a then - enormous 2.25 acres ( 9,100 m ) , it was built in just 15 months at a cost of $310,000 . It opened in March 1881 . </P> <P> Congress authorized construction of a new building on June 28 , 1902 . On January 29 , 1903 , a special committee composed of members of Congress and representatives from the Smithsonian 's board of regents published a report asking Congress to fund a much larger structure than originally planned . The regents began considering sites for the new building in March , and by April 12 settled on a site on the north side of B Street NW between 9th and 12th Streets . The D.C. architectural firm of Hornblower & Marshall was chosen to design the structure . Testing of the soil for the foundations was set for July 1903 , with construction expected to take three years . </P> Model T Ford parked in front of the National Museum in 1926 <P> The Natural History Building ( as the National Museum of Natural History was originally known ) opened its doors to the public on March 17 , 1910 , in order to provide the Smithsonian Institution with more space for collections and research . The building was not fully completed until June 1911 . The structure cost $3.5 million ( about $85 million in inflation - adjusted 2012 ) dollars . The Neoclassical style building was the first structure constructed on the north side of the National Mall as part of the 1901 McMillan Commission plan . In addition to the Smithsonian 's natural history collection , it also housed the American history , art , and cultural collections . </P> <H3> 1981 -- 2003 ( edit ) </H3> <P> Between 1981 and 2003 , the National Museum of Natural History had 11 permanent and acting directors . There were six directors alone between 1990 and 2002 . Turnover was high as the museum 's directors were disenchanted by low levels of funding and the Smithsonian 's inability to clearly define the museum 's mission . Robert W. Fri was named the museum 's director in 1996 . One of the largest donations in Smithsonian history was made during Fri 's tenure . Kenneth E. Behring donated $20 million in 1997 to modernize the museum . Fri resigned in 2001 after disagreeing with Smithsonian leadership over the reorganization of the museum 's scientific research programs . </P> <P> J. Dennis O'Connor , Provost of the Smithsonian Institution ( where he oversaw all science and research programs ) was named acting director of the museum on July 25 , 2001 . Eight months later , O'Conner resigned to become the vice president of research and dean of the graduate school at the University of Maryland . Douglas Erwin , a paleontologist at the National Museum of Natural History , was appointed interim director in June 2002 . </P> The museum as seen from the National Mall <H3> 2003 -- 2007 ( edit ) </H3> <P> In January 2003 , the Smithsonian announced that Cristi\u00e1n Samper , a Colombian with an M.Sc. and Ph. D. from Harvard University , would become the museum 's permanent director on March 31 , 2003 . Samper ( who holds dual citizenship with Colombia and the United States ) founded the Alexander von Humboldt Biological Resources Research Institute and ran the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute after 2001 . Smithsonian officials said Samper 's administrative experience proved critical in his appointment . Under Samper 's direction , the museum opened the $100 million Behring Hall of Mammals in November 2003 , received $60 million in 2004 for the Sant Hall of Oceans , and received a $1 million gift from Tiffany & Co. for the purchase of precious gems for the National Gem Collection . </P> Aerial view , 2008 <P> On March 25 , 2007 , Lawrence M. Small , Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution and the organization 's highest - ranking appointed official , resigned abruptly after public reports of lavish spending . </P> <H3> 2007 -- 2012 ( edit ) </H3> <P> On March 27 , 2007 Samper was appointed Acting Secretary of the Smithsonian . Paul G. Risser , former chancellor of the University of Oklahoma , was named Acting Director of the Museum of Natural History on March 29 . </P> <P> Samper 's tenure at the museum was not without controversy . In May 2007 , Robert Sullivan , the former associate director in charge of exhibitions at the National Museum of Natural History , charged that Samper and Smithsonian Undersecretary for Science David Evans ( Samper 's supervisor ) ordered `` last minute '' changes in the exhibit `` Arctic : A Friend Acting Strangely '' to tone down the role of human beings in the discussion of global warming , and to make global warming seem more uncertain than originally depicted . Samper denied that he knew of any scientific objections to the changes , and said that no political pressure had been applied to the Smithsonian to make the changes . In November 2007 , The Washington Post reported that an interagency group of scientists from the Department of the Interior , NASA , National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) , and National Science Foundation believed that , despite Samper 's denial , the museum `` acted to avoid criticism from congressional appropriators and global - warming skeptics in the Bush administration '' . The changes were discussed as early as mid-August 2005 , and Dr. Waleed Abdalati , manager of NASA 's Cryospheric Sciences Program , noted at the time that `` There was some discussion of the political sensitivities of the exhibit . '' Although the exhibit was due to open in October 2005 , the Post reported that Samper ordered a six - month delay to allow for even further changes . The newspaper also reported that it had obtained a memo drafted by Samper shortly after October 15 , 2005 , in which Samper said the museum should not `` replicate '' work by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change . A few weeks later , a NOAA climate researcher advised a superior that the delay was due to `` the debate within the administration and the science community over the existence and cause of global warming '' . During the delay , Samper asked high - level officials in other government agencies and departments to review the script for the exhibit , ordered his museum staff to make additionals changes , and rearranged the sequence of the exhibit panels so that the discussion of climate change was not immediately encountered by museum visitors . Shortly before the exhibit opened in April 2006 , officials at NOAA and the United States Department of Commerce expressed to their superiors their opinion that the exhibit had been changed to accommodate political concerns . In an interview with The Washington Post in November 2007 , Samper said he felt the exhibit displayed a scientific certainty that did not exist , and expressed his belief that the museum should present evidence on both sides and let the public make up its own mind . </P> Inside the rotunda <P> The controversy became more heated after the press reported that Samper gave permission for the museum to accept a $5 million donation from American Petroleum Institute that would support the museum 's soon - to - be-opened Hall of Oceans . Two members of the Smithsonian Institution 's Board of Regents ( which had final say on accepting the donation ) questioned whether the donation was a conflict of interest . Before the board could consider the donation , the donor withdrew the offer . </P> <P> Risser resigned as acting director of the museum on January 22 , 2008 , in order to return to his position at the University of Oklahoma . No new acting director was named at that time . Six weeks later , the Smithsonian regents chose Georgia Tech president G. Wayne Clough as the new Secretary . Samper stepped down to return to his position as Director of the National Museum of Natural History . </P> <P> The remainder of Samper 's tenure at the museum proved less controversial . In June 2008 , the Victoria and Roger Sant family donated $15 million to endow the new Ocean Hall at the museum . The museum celebrated the 50th anniversary of its acquisition of the Hope Diamond in August 2009 by giving the gemstone its own exhibit and a new setting . In March 2010 , the museum opened its $21 million human evolution hall . </P> <P> In January 2012 , Samper said he was stepping down from the National Museum of Natural History to become president and chief executive officer of the Wildlife Conservation Society . Two months later , the museum announced it had received a $35 million gift to renovate its dinosaur hall , and a month later the Sant family donated another $10 million to endow the director 's position . On July 25 , 2012 Kirk Johnson , vice president of research and collections at the Denver Museum of Nature and Science , was named Samper 's successor effective October 29 , 2012 . Johnson oversees a museum with 460 employees and a $68 million budget . </P> <H2> Research and collections ( edit ) </H2> <P> The Smithsonian gives an approximate number for artifacts and specimens of 127.3 million . More specifically , the collections include 30 million insects , 4.5 million plants preserved in the Museum 's herbarium , and 7 million fish stored in liquid - filled jars . Of the 2 million cultural artifacts , 400,000 are photographs housed in the National Anthropological Archives . Through an off - site active loan and exchange program , the museum 's collections can be accessed . As a result , 3.5 million specimens are out on loan every year . The rest of the collections not on display are stored in the non-public research areas of the museum and at the Museum Support Center , located in Suitland , MD . Other facilities include a marine science center in Ft . Pierce , Florida and field stations in Belize , Alaska , and Kenya . </P> <P> Research in the museum is divided into seven departments : anthropology , botany , entomology , invertebrate zoology , mineral sciences , paleobiology , vertebrate zoology . </P> <P> One collection of nearly a million specimens of birds , reptiles , and mammals kept at the museum has been maintained by the Biological Survey unit of the U.S. Geological Survey . This division had started in 1885 as an economic ornithology unit of the Agriculture Department . Clarence Birdseye and Clinton Hart Merriam had worked in this organization . As of February 2018 , the unit 's funding is planned to be cut , and it is not clear what would happen to the collection . </P> <H2> Exhibitions ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Hall of Geology , gems , and minerals ( edit ) </H3> The Star of Asia , a large , 330 - carat cabochon - cut star sapphire in the U.S. National Gem Collection The Hope Diamond <P> The National Gem and Mineral Collection is one of the most significant collections of its kind in the world . The collection includes some of the most famous pieces of gems and minerals including the Hope Diamond and the Star of Asia Sapphire , one of the largest sapphires in the world . There are currently over 15,000 individual gems in the collection , as well as 350,000 minerals and 300,000 samples of rock and ore specimens . Additionally , the Smithsonian 's National Gem and Mineral Collection houses approximately 35,000 meteorites , which is considered to be one of the most comprehensive collections of its kind in the world . </P> <P> The collection is displayed in the Janet Annenberg Hooker Hall of Geology , Gems and Minerals , one of the many galleries in the Museum of Natural History . Some of the most important donors , besides Hooker , are Washington A. Roebling , the man who built the Brooklyn Bridge , who gave 16,000 specimens to the collection ; Frederick A. Canfield , who donated 9,000 specimens to the collection ; and Dr. Isaac Lea , who donated the basis of the museum 's collection of 1312 gems and minerals . </P> <H3> Hall of Human Origins ( edit ) </H3> Rick Potts , head of Smithsonian Human Origins project <P> The David H. Koch Hall of Human Origins opened on March 17 , 2010 , marking the museum 's 100th anniversary . The hall is named for David H. Koch , who contributed $15 million to the $20.7 million exhibit . </P> <P> The Hall is `` dedicated to the discovery and understanding of human origins , '' and occupies 15,000 square feet ( 1,400 m ) of exhibit space . Specimens include 75 replica skulls , an interactive human family tree that follows six million years of evolution , and a Changing the World gallery that focuses on issues surrounding climate change and humans ' impact on the world . The Hall 's core concept idea is `` What Does It Mean To Be Human '' , and focuses on milestones of Human Evolution such as Walking Upright , Bigger Brains , and Creating a World of Symbols . Also covered is the Smithsonian 's significant research on the geological and climate changes which occurred in East Africa during significant periods of Human Evolution . The exhibit highlights an actual fossil Neanderthal and replicas created by famed paleoartist , John Gurche . The exhibit has been criticized for downplaying the significance of human - caused global warming . </P> <P> The exhibit also provides a complementary web site , which provides diaries and podcasts directly from related fields of research . The Companion Book , What Does It Mean To Be Human was written by Richard ( Rick ) Potts , the Curator , and Christopher Sloan . The exhibit was designed by Reich + Petch . </P> <H3> Dinosaurs / Hall of paleobiology ( edit ) </H3> Skeleton of Brontotherium The revised skeleton of Triceratops Play media A FossiLab volunteer uses lab equipment to sift through collected sediments for bone particles at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History . <P> The museum has over 570,000 catalogued reptiles from around the world . The National Collection of Amphibians and Reptiles has increased 300 percent since 1970 to over 570,000 specimen records in 2008 . The Hall of Dinosaurs has fossilized skeletons and cast models , including Tyrannosaurus rex cast facing a Triceratops cast . The Triceratops exhibit shows the first accurate dinosaur skeleton in virtual motion , achieved through the use of scanning and digital technology . '' The collection consists of 46 `` complete and important specimens '' of dinosaurs . </P> <P> In May 2012 , billionaire David H. Koch donated $35 million toward the cost of a $45 million upgrade to the 30 - year - old , 25,000 square feet ( 2,300 m ) dinosaur hall . The hall is anticipated to close in the spring of 2014 and reopen in 2019 . </P> <P> In June 2013 , the Smithsonian obtained a 50 - year lease on a T. rex fossil skeleton owned by the United States Army Corps of Engineers . It is the first T. rex skeleton to be displayed at the museum , which until now has only had the cast of a skull . The specimen , known as the `` Wankel '' or `` Devil '' rex , was found on Corps - owned land in the Charles M. Russell National Wildlife Refuge in Montana in 1988 . It has since been on display at the Museum of the Rockies in Bozeman , Montana ( which helped excavate the fossil ) . The `` Wankel rex '' ( whose skeleton is 85 percent complete ) was to be unveiled at the Museum of Natural History on National Fossil Day , October 16 , 2013 , and was supposed to be on display until the dinosaur hall exhibit closes for renovation in the spring of 2014 . The 35 - foot ( 11 m ) long skeleton will be the centerpiece of the dinosaur hall when it re-opens in 2019 . The Museum of the Rockies ( which did not own the skeleton but was the repository for it ) has about a dozen T. rex specimens , including one which is eighty percent complete . Only about six museums in the United States have a T. rex skeleton . The Museum of the Rockies is a Smithsonian affiliate museum , and had long promised to find a T. rex for the Smithsonian to display . </P> <P> Due to the 2013 federal government shutdown , the fossil did not arrive in Washington , D.C. Smithsonian officials said it remained in storage in Montana , and would not arrive at the Smithsonian until late spring 2014 . Packed up in 16 crates , the T. rex , named `` Nation 's T. rex '' by the Smithsonian , traveled from the Museum of the Rockies and arrived at the National Museum of Natural History on April 15 , 2014 . The T. rex has been displayed in the Rex Room , while specialists performed a conservation assessment and the Smithsonian Digitization Program scanned each bone , to create a 3 - D model for research . The Nation 's T. rex will be the centerpiece of the new fossil hall , opening in 2019 . </P> <H3> Hall of Mammals ( edit ) </H3> <P> The Behring Hall of Mammals was designed by Reich + Petch . The mammal specimens are presented as works of modern art within minimal environmentals . Visitors discover mammal 's evolutionary adaptions to hugely diverse contexts , and ultimately discover that they too are mammals . </P> <P> The museum has the largest collection of vertebrate specimens in the world , nearly twice the size of the next largest mammal collections , including historically important collections from the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries . Its collection was initiated by C. Hart Merriam and the U.S. Department of Agriculture ( later the Department of the Interior ) , which expanded it in the 1890s - 1930s . </P> <H3> Insect zoo ( edit ) </H3> <P> The O. Orkin Insect Zoo features live insects and exhibits about insects and entomologists . Different habitats have been created to show the type of insects that live in different environments and how they have adapted to a freshwater pond , house , mangrove swamp , desert , and rain forest . The zoo is sponsored by Orkin , a pest control company . </P> <H3> Ocean Hall ( edit ) </H3> Ocean Hall <P> The Sant Ocean Hall opened on September 27 , 2008 , and is the largest renovation of the museum since it opened in 1910 . The hall includes 674 marine specimens and models drawn from the over 80 million specimens in the museum 's total collection , the largest in the world . The hall is named for the Roger Sant family , who donated $15 million to endow the new hall and other related programs . </P> <P> The collection includes : a coelenterate - long North Atlantic Right Whale , a 1,500 - gallon aquarium , one female giant squid displayed in the center of the hall and a male displayed off to the side , an adult coelenterate , and a Basilosaurus . </P> <P> The museum also provides the Smithsonian Ocean Portal , a complementary web site which provides regularly updated , original content from the museum 's research , collections , and Sant Ocean Hall as well as content provided by more than 20 collaborating organizations , including Archive , Census of Marine Life , Consortium for Ocean Leadership , Encyclopedia of Life , INDUCT , Monterrey Bay Aquarium , Monterrey Bay Aquarium Research Institute , National Geographic , NOAA , New England Aquarium , Ocean Conservancy , Oceania , Pew Charitable Trusts , Sea Web , Save Our Seas , Scrips Institution of Oceanography , Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution , World Heritage Marine Programmer . </P> <H3> African voices ( edit ) </H3> <P> This exhibit and associated website `` examines the diversity , dynamism , and global influence of Africa 's peoples and cultures over time in the realms of family , work , community , and the natural environment . '' </P> <H3> Butterflies + plants : partners in Evolution ( edit ) </H3> <P> Featuring a live butterfly pavilion allows `` visitors to observe the many ways in which butterflies and other animals have evolved , adapted , and diversified together with their plant partners over tens of millions of years . '' The exhibit was designed by Reich + Petch . </P> <H3> Western cultures Hall ( edit ) </H3> <P> `` This hall explores some examples from various cultures in the western world including northern Iraq , ancient Egypt , Greece and Rome and the recent discovery of the Iceman , a Copper Age mummy found in an Italian glacier . '' This exhibit closed September 26 , 2010 . </P> <H3> Korea gallery ( edit ) </H3> <P> The Korea Gallery is a special showcase to celebrate Korean traditions and examine its unique influence and complex role in the world today . </P> <P> The exhibit expresses the continuity of the past by highlighting enduring features of Korean culture that have influence and resonance today . The exhibit uses the Smithsonian ceramics collection as well as a rich selection of photographs , ritual objects and traditional Korean carpentry to communicate and connect to both the local Korean community and an international audience . Traditional art forms , such as ceramics and calligraphy , along with mythological figures , language , large feature photographs and illustrations speak to a range of shared historical memories that connect Koreans at home and abroad . </P> <P> Personal stories of modern Koreans , as told in their own voices , provide a context to discuss some of the many issues that face the divided country today . Korea 's incredible transformation from ' The Hermit Kingdom ' to a world power is traced through its impact on the arts , the economy and popular culture . The exhibit was designed by Reich + Petch . </P> <H3> Teleology : Hall of Bones ( edit ) </H3> <P> This exhibit displays a `` variety of vertebrate skeletons grouped by their evolutionary relationships .
