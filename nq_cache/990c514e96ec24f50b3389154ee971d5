He then walked up a staircase and appeared on a ramp stage extending outward into the field , descending into a series of stages surrounded by a crowd . Timberlake proceeded to move through the crowd performing `` Rock Your Body '' with a troupe of female backup dancers , abruptly stopping short of the end of the song and shifting to `` Se\u00f1orita '' on a small stage with his backing dancers . Upon reaching the main stage , he performed a number of songs , including `` SexyBack '' , `` My Love '' , and `` Cry Me a River '' , which featured a dance break mid-field . Upon reaching the next stage , Timberlake performed his hit song `` Suit & Tie '' as the University of Minnesota Marching Band , wearing black tuxedos , played backup instrumentals and marched out to meet him . </P> The Stadium and the city of Minneapolis were shown to be lit purple during Timberlake 's tribute to Prince Dancers fill the field during Timberlake 's performance of `` Ca n't Stop the Feeling ! '' <P> Timberlake proceeded to walk up to a white grand piano while performing `` Until the End of Time '' , then segued into `` I Would Die 4 U '' as a tribute to Minneapolis - native Prince . A video of Prince performing the song played in the background , projected onto on a large multi-story sheet . An aerial shot showed downtown Minneapolis covered in purple lighting that morphed into Prince 's trademark Love Symbol , with the stadium at the center . He then returned to the main stage to perform `` Mirrors '' , as hundreds of dancers and members of the marching band performed choreography with large mirrors , creating bright reflections in the broadcast and across the roof of the stadium . Timberlake closed the show with `` Ca n't Stop the Feeling ! '' , entering the stands at the conclusion of the song . </P> <P> For the first time since the Super Bowl XLVI halftime show in Indianapolis in 2012 , no pyrotechnics were used throughout the performance . The show relied mostly on lasers and video screens for visual effects . </P> <H2> Background ( edit ) </H2> Field being set up for Timberlake 's performance <P> In July 2017 , multiple media outlets reported that Britney Spears was in talks to perform at Halftime , but Pepsi quickly denied it a few days later . During August and September 2017 , several publications informed that Timberlake was the frontrunner to performer at the Super Bowl LII halftime , first along with his frequent - collaborator Jay - Z as co-headliner , and then as the solo performer . A spokesperson from the NFL stated at the time , `` along with Pepsi , we know that we will put on a spectacular show . When it is time to announce her name we will do it . Or his name . Or their names . '' The NFL confirmed the announcement on October 22 with a video starring Timberlake and Jimmy Fallon . </P> <P> This was Timberlake 's third appearance in a Super Bowl halftime show . As a member of NSYNC , Timberlake appeared in the Super Bowl XXXV ( 2001 ) halftime show , and as a guest artist in the Super Bowl XXXVIII ( 2004 ) , which performance featured a controversial incident where Timberlake accidentally exposed one of Janet Jackson 's breasts on national television , described as a wardrobe malfunction . The Parents Television Council penned an open letter to Timberlake asking to keep the performance `` family - friendly . '' While the organization acknowledged that Timberlake apologized for the 2004 incident , they asked him to stay true to his word , saying `` we are heartened by your response that the events of 2004 are not going to happen in 2018 , '' as the singer stated in a prior interview that `` we are not going to do that again . '' </P> <P> In an interview with Billboard , Pepsi executives expressed : </P> <P> We are all big fans of Justin Timberlake . We 've kind of felt that Justin deserves , and has for a number of years , to be the main artist for the halftime show because previously he was n't the main artist . It was just about the timing . To be honest , we have discussed Justin for the last number of years for coming and doing halftime , and this year just felt really right to us . He is hands down one of the greatest entertainers currently alive , it was a no - brainer . We know he 's gon na bring it . </P> <P> The Halftime Show included a remembrance for Indianapolis Colts linebacker Edwin Jackson , who died just hours before Super Bowl LII after being struck by a vehicle . </P> <H2> Development ( edit ) </H2> The U.S. Bank Stadium , where Super Bowl and the halftime show was held . <P> During the performance , Timberlake wore an outfit designed by Stella McCartney , which consists of `` alter nappa fringed jacket with a shirt , featuring a landscape artwork by British artist Martin Ridley , '' according to a press release . Also part of the look is a Prince of Wales - check and camouflage splatter - print suit and matching jacket . As usual for McCartney , these pieces were made from animal - free leather and organic cotton . </P> <P> Timberlake stated in a press conference that there would be no guest musicians in the halftime show and that the event would focus solely on himself and his backing band , the Tennessee Kids . Regarding the Prince tribute , the performance 's creative visual lead , Fireplay 's Nick Whitehouse , told Rolling Stone : </P> <P> Paying tribute to Prince was something JT highlighted as an important moment for this show , and we spent quite a bit of time ensuring this moment would be true to his legacy . Ultimately , Justin decided that the only person who could do Prince justice is Prince . The band held 50 - hours worth of rehearsals in preparation for the show . </P> <P> Prince had previously stated he did not want to be included in new music after death in a 1998 interview , citing The Beatles ' `` Free as a Bird '' as an example of a practice he considered to be `` demonic . '' His family granted permission to use Prince 's likeness on the condition that it not be used in a hologram , and they approved of the final result . Sheila E , a former bandmate of Prince 's who was involved in negotiations over the use of his likeness , stated that `` a bigger company '' ( she declined to specify whether it was Pepsi or the NFL ) had insisted on including the Prince apparition and that the notion was not originally Timberlake 's idea . </P> <P> Despite the lack of an individual guest artist , the more than 300 - member University of Minnesota Marching Band was featured in the show . The band 's drumline , brass , and saxophone sections pre-recorded and performed with Timberlake during his performance of `` Suit & Tie . '' The upper woodwind and auxiliary sections led drill formations and held large mirrors during Timberlake 's performance of his song `` Mirrors '' , and acted as fans and dancers throughout other portions of the show , including the club scene at the show 's opening . All members of the band were featured on the field in the show 's finale , `` Ca n't Stop the Feeling ! '' . The band had previously performed in the halftime show of Super Bowl XXVI . </P> <H2> Critical response ( edit ) </H2> <P> Timberlake 's performance received mixed reviews . In a positive review , Bruce R. Miller of Sioux City Journal wrote `` Timberlake is a masterful live performer -- which made Sunday 's Super Bowl performance about the only sure bet , '' he continued commenting the performer `` did a lot of infectious dancing and managed to play with the crowd like no other . '' Although it did not have a moment that `` stuck , '' he considered the Prince tribute the best moment of the show . In a similarly positive review , Taylor Weatherby of Billboard said `` there is no denying that Timberlake absolutely rocked his first headlining ( halftime ) '' , further adding `` Timberlake 's halftime show was undeniably mesmerizing . From starting in the concourse to making his way into the crowd ( and making # SelfieKid an instant superstar ) for the ending . '' She also considered it `` is made for a TV experience '' rather than for the public in the stadium , mainly for the sound quality difficulties , but also criticized him for including Rock Your Body in the set list . From the same magazine , Nina Braca wrote `` his moves were on point , '' and Andrew Ubterberger said two things were `` relatively certain '' about the performance . `` most of America would love it , and most of the Internet would hate it , '' and added Timberlake was `` in a situation that was both a ca n't - lose and a ca n't - win . It would 've been virtually impossible for him to please the critics he 'd alienated over the last couple years . '' Also from Billboard , Andrew Unterberge wrote , `` Timberlake 's audio was somewhat lacking throughout ... but the choreography , live - band energy and song selection were all pretty impeccable '' . </P> <P> Chris Willman of Variety stated that , `` Timberlake turned in a more enjoyably physical performance than just about anybody else who 's done the Bowl show ... and if it was more a feat of athleticism than aestheticism , you ca n't say that 's entirely inappropriate for the occasion . '' Willman also wrote that the show , `` was n't one for the ages , but was impressive as a show of athleticism '' </P> <P> Jon Caramanica of The New York Times wrote that Timberlake 's performance was , `` heavy on dance spectacle , light on vocal authority '' . Daniel Fienberg of The Hollywood Reporter called the show , `` energetic , but also entirely lacking in live excitement . '' Feinberg criticized the show for largely lacking spontaneity and live vocals . Feinberg wrote that Timberlake delivered , `` one of the most over-planned , least surprising performances imaginable . '' Darren Franich of Entertainment Weekly graded Timberlake 's performance a `` C '' , calling it , `` dutiful , and empty '' . Franich faulted Timberlake for playing too safe with his performance . Similarly , Fran Guan of Vulture.com wrote , `` Technically speaking , Timberlake 's set was a testament to precision '' . Guan , however , criticized Timberlake 's performance from lacking in personality , and regarded his performance as unmemorable . </P> <P> The Guardian gave Timberlake 3 out of 5 stars , calling his performance forgettable but flashy . In an interview with NPR , Ann Powers said that `` the entire performance was shrouded in the sense of Timberlake not being right for this moment -- and the Janet Jackson controversy haunted it . '' Daniel D'Addarrio of Time.com gave the performance a negative review , criticizing Timberlake for singing Cry Me A River in addition to Rock Your Body , calling the song 's lyrics about an evil promiscuous woman out of step with the national mood , and said that the only message from Timberlake 's performance was that he loves his back catalog Deadline felt `` but you could see the motions more than you felt the music . '' Chris Richards of The Washington Post regarded Timberlake 's performance as , `` unambiguously underwhelming '' . </P> <P> USA Today and Vulture compared Timberlake 's performance unfavorably to Prince 's own 2007 halftime show . Amanda Petrusich of The New Yorker wrote that Timberlake 's decision to omit the end of `` Rock Your Body '' ( which was performed during the controversial 2004 halftime ) felt , `` less like an apology than yet more spineless deflection '' . However , Andrew Unterberge of Billboard considered Timberlake 's decision to cut the song short to be wise . Timberlake 's Stella McCartney - designed outfit received negative reviews , with some critics regarding it as `` tacky '' . The LA Times also gave a very critical review , one which also stated that Timberlake had nothing to say in his performance , and said that it lacked soul and meaning . The Digital Journal gave him 2 / 5 stars and called it lackluster . </P> <H2> Commercial reception ( edit ) </H2> <P> The Super Bowl LII halftime show was seen by 106.6 million television viewers in the United States , 9 % less than Lady Gaga 's in 2017 . It had higher average viewership than the game itself , and the decline for the halftime show was roughly in line with that of the game as a whole , which had lost 7 % compared to the previous year . </P> <P> According to initial sales reports from Nielsen Music , sales of the songs Timberlake performed during the halftime show gained 534 % in the United States on February 4 , the day of the Super Bowl , compared to Feb. 3 , while his streams on Spotify gained 214 % . Janet Jackson likewise gained 150 % on Spotify . </P> <H2> Setlist ( edit ) </H2> Timberlake performing alongside a video projection of Prince <Ol> <Li> `` Filthy '' </Li> <Li> `` Rock Your Body '' </Li> <Li> `` Se\u00f1orita '' </Li> <Li> `` SexyBack '' ( with elements of `` Supplies '' ) </Li> <Li> `` My Love '' </Li> <Li> `` Cry Me a River '' ( with elements of `` Kashmir '' ) </Li> <Li> `` Suit & Tie '' ( with elements of `` Pusher Love Girl '' ) ( featuring the University of Minnesota Marching Band ) </Li> <Li> `` Until the End of Time '' </Li> <Li> `` I Would Die 4 U '' ( along with a pre-recorded video of Prince , displayed on a projection screen ) </Li> <Li> `` Mirrors '' </Li> <Li> `` Ca n't Stop the Feeling !
