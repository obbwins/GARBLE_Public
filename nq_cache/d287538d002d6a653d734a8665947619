The writing group has executed numerous songs recorded by Cyrus , contributing to a large part of all three of her studio albums . </P> <P> When composing tracks for Meet Miley Cyrus , Cyrus was originally very apprehensive in regards to adding `` See You Again '' to the album . `` I 'm not sure about this song . I do n't think I want to put it on the album . I do n't really like it that much . It 's just O.K. '' , she said . However , she was convinced to record it and , once she listened to the finished product , she changed her mind . She thought it was odd , but in a positive light , and decided to include it on her debut album . Cyrus says `` See You Again '' is a dance song with a special meaning to her . The song was remixed by Rock Mafia for the release of Cyrus ' second studio album Breakout ( 2008 ) . </P> <H2> Composition ( edit ) </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> `` See You Again '' ( 2007 ) An 18 - second preview of Miley Cyrus ' `` See You Again '' .

Alas , FM , better late than never '' , he concluded . Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine said , `` The Hannah Montana star 's 2007 single ' See You Again ' managed to click with non-tween listeners thanks ( to being ) gustier than anything her fellow Disney Channel superstar Hilary Duff has ever put to digital . </P> <P> Mikael Wood of The Los Angeles Times believed the song was `` no shortage of crafty tween - rock gems '' . Ash Dosanjh of Yahoo ! Music believed the Rock Mafia remix of the song was a so `` glorious '' that it signaled Breakout would do exactly that . Josh Timmermann of PopMatters referred to the remix as the best song on Breakout , describing it as a `` marvelous slice of teenaged life set to club rock beats . '' Timmermann continued to praise the track , saying it felt `` infinitely more genuine and thoughtful than '' any other track on Breakout and that the small - time teen drama fit Cyrus ' voice . `` It sounds far less ludicrously melodramatic than it might have delivered by less forceful pipes '' , he concluded . George Lang of The Oklahoman thought the inclusion of the song 's remix on Breakout was used to cover more musical genres in order to appeal to a wider fanbase . In 2008 , the track was listed as a `` Winning Song '' by Broadcast Music Incorporated ( BMI ) . </P> <H2> Commercial performance ( edit ) </H2> <P> On the week ending December 22 , 2007 , `` See You Again '' debuted at number 94 on the Billboard Hot 100 .
