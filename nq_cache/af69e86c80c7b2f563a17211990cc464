Players traverse post-apocalyptic environments such as towns , buildings , forest and sewers to advance the story . Players use firearms , improvised weapons , and stealth to defend against hostile humans and cannibalistic creatures infected by a mutated strain of the Cordyceps fungus . For most of the game , players control Joel , a man tasked with escorting a young girl , Ellie , across the United States ; Ellie and other companions are controlled by the artificial intelligence . Players also control Ellie throughout the game 's winter segment . </P> <P> In combat , players can use long - range weapons , such as rifles , shotguns , and bows , and short - range weapons such as handguns and short - barreled shotgun . Players can scavenge limited - use melee weapons , such as pipes and baseball bats , and throw bottles and bricks to distract , stun , or attack enemies . Players can upgrade weapons at workbenches using collected items . Equipment such as health kits and Molotov cocktails can be found or crafted using collected items . Attributes such as the health meter and crafting speed can be upgraded by collecting pills and medicinal plants . Health can be recharged through the use of health kits. . </P> Listen Mode allows players to discover the position of enemies and characters by displaying their outline through walls , achieved through a heightened sense of hearing and spatial awareness . <P> Though players can attack enemies directly , they can also use stealth to attack undetected or sneak by them . `` Listen Mode '' allows players to locate enemies through a heightened sense of hearing and spatial awareness , indicated as outlines visible through walls and objects . In the dynamic cover system , players crouch behind obstacles to gain a tactical advantage during combat . The game features periods without combat , often involving conversation between the characters .

Story collectibles , such as notes , maps and comics , can be scavenged and viewed in the backpack menu . </P> <P> The game features an artificial intelligence system by which hostile human enemies react to combat . If enemies discover the player , they may take cover or call for assistance , and can take advantage of players when they are distracted , out of ammunition , or in a fight . Player companions , such as Ellie , can assist in combat by throwing objects at threats to stun them , announcing the location of unseen enemies , or using a knife and pistol to attack enemies . </P> <H3> Multiplayer ( edit ) </H3> <P> The online multiplayer allows up to eight players to engage in competitive gameplay in recreations of multiple single - player settings . The game features three multiplayer game types : Supply Raid and Survivors are both team deathmatches , with the latter excluding the ability to respawn ; Interrogation features teams investigating the location of the enemy team 's lockbox , and the first to capture such lockbox wins . In every mode , players select a faction -- Hunters ( a group of hostile survivors ) or Fireflies ( a revolutionary militia group ) -- and keep their clan alive by collecting supplies during matches . Each match is equal to one day ; by surviving twelve `` weeks '' , players have completed a journey and can re-select their Faction . Killing enemies , reviving allies , and crafting items earn the player parts that can be converted to supplies ; parts can also be scavenged from enemies ' bodies . Players are able to carry more equipment by earning points as their clan 's supplies grow . Players can connect the game to their Facebook account , which alters clan members ' names and faces to match the players ' Facebook friends . Players have the ability to customize their characters with hats , helmets , masks , and emblems . </P> <H2> Plot ( edit ) </H2> See also : List of The Last of Us characters <P> In September 2013 , an outbreak of a mutant Cordyceps fungus ravages the United States , transforming its human hosts into cannibalistic monsters known as infected . In the suburbs of Austin , Texas , Joel ( Troy Baker ) flees the chaos with his brother Tommy ( Jeffrey Pierce ) and daughter Sarah ( Hana Hayes ) . As they flee , Sarah is shot by a soldier and dies in Joel 's arms . In the twenty years that follow , most of civilization is destroyed by the infection . Survivors live in heavily policed quarantine zones , independent settlements , and nomadic groups . Joel works as a smuggler with his partner Tess ( Annie Wersching ) in the quarantine zone in the North End of Boston , Massachusetts . They hunt down Robert ( Robin Atkin Downes ) , a black - market dealer , to recover a stolen weapons cache . Before Tess kills him , Robert reveals that he traded the cache with the Fireflies , a rebel militia opposing the quarantine zone authorities . </P> <P> The leader of the Fireflies , Marlene ( Merle Dandridge ) , promises to double their cache in return for smuggling a teenage girl , Ellie ( Ashley Johnson ) , to Fireflies hiding in the Massachusetts State House outside the quarantine zone . Joel , Tess , and Ellie sneak out in the night , but after an encounter with a patrol , they discover Ellie is infected . Full infection normally occurs in under two days , but Ellie claims she was infected three weeks ago and that her immunity may lead to a cure . The trio make their way to their destination through hordes of the infected , but find that the Fireflies there have been killed . Tess reveals she has been bitten by an infected ; believing in Ellie 's importance , Tess sacrifices herself against pursuing soldiers so Joel and Ellie can escape . Joel decides to find Tommy , a former Firefly , in the hope that he can locate the remaining Fireflies . With the help of Bill ( W. Earl Brown ) , a smuggler who owes Joel a favor , they acquire a working vehicle . Driving into Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , Joel and Ellie are ambushed by bandits and their car is wrecked . They ally with two brothers , Henry ( Brandon Scott ) and Sam ( Nadji Jeter ) ; after they escape the city , Sam is bitten by an infected , but hides it from the group . As his infection takes hold , Sam attacks Ellie , but Henry shoots him dead and commits suicide out of grief . </P> <P> In the fall , Joel and Ellie finally find Tommy in Jackson , Wyoming , where he has assembled a fortified settlement near a hydroelectric dam with his wife Maria ( Ashley Scott ) . Joel contemplates leaving Ellie with Tommy , but after she confronts him about Sarah , he decides to let her stay with him . Tommy directs them to a Fireflies enclave at the University of Eastern Colorado . They find the university abandoned , but learn that the Fireflies have moved to a hospital in Salt Lake City , Utah . Afterward , Joel is severely wounded by bandits , who are killed by Ellie . </P> <P> During the winter , Ellie and Joel shelter in the mountains . Joel is on the brink of death and relies on Ellie to care for him . Hunting for food , Ellie encounters David ( Nolan North ) and James ( Reuben Langdon ) , scavengers willing to trade medicine for food ; David turns hostile after revealing the university bandits were part of his group . Ellie manages to lead David 's group away from Joel , but is eventually captured ; David intends to recruit her into his cannibal group . Refusing the offer , she escapes after killing James , but David corners her in a burning restaurant . Meanwhile , Joel recovers from his wounds and sets out to find Ellie . He reaches Ellie as she kills David and breaks down crying ; Joel comforts her before they flee . </P> <P> In the spring , Joel and Ellie arrive in Salt Lake City and are captured by a Firefly patrol . In the hospital , Marlene tells Joel that Ellie is being prepared for surgery : in hope of producing a vaccine for the infection , the Fireflies must remove the infected portion of Ellie 's brain , which will kill her . Unwilling to let Ellie die , Joel battles his way to the operating room and carries the unconscious Ellie to the parking garage . He is confronted by Marlene , whom he shoots and kills to prevent the Fireflies from pursuing them . On the drive out of the city , Joel claims that the Fireflies had found many other immune people but were unable to create a cure , and that they have stopped trying . On the outskirts of Tommy 's settlement , Ellie reveals that she was not alone when she was infected and expresses her survivor guilt . At her insistence , Joel swears his story about the Fireflies is true . </P> <H2> Development ( edit ) </H2> Main article : Development of The Last of Us Bruce Straley ( left ) and Neil Druckmann ( right ) were appointed to lead development on The Last of Us , as game director and creative director , respectively . <P> Naughty Dog began developing The Last of Us in 2009 , following the release of Uncharted 2 : Among Thieves . For the first time in the company 's history , Naughty Dog split into two teams ; while one team developed Uncharted 3 : Drake 's Deception ( 2011 ) , the other began work on The Last of Us . Director Bruce Straley and creative director Neil Druckmann led the team responsible for developing The Last of Us . </P> <P> Druckmann views The Last of Us as a coming of age story , in which Ellie adapts to survival after spending time with Joel , as well as an exploration of how willing a father is to save his child . A major motif of the game is that `` life goes on '' ; this is presented in a scene in which Joel and Ellie discover a herd of giraffes , which concept artist John Sweeney explained was designed to `` reignite ( Ellie 's ) lust for life '' , after her suffering following her encounter with David . The Infected , a core concept of the game , were inspired by a segment of the BBC nature documentary Planet Earth ( 2006 ) , which featured the Cordyceps fungi . Though the fungi mainly infect insects , taking control of their motor functions and forcing them to help cultivate the fungus , the game explores the concept of the fungus evolving and infecting humans , and the direct results of an outbreak of this infection . </P> <P> The relationship between Joel and Ellie was the central focus of the game ; all other elements were developed around it . Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson were cast as Joel and Ellie , respectively , and provided voice and motion capture performances . Baker and Johnson contributed to the development of the characters ; for example , Baker convinced Druckmann that Joel would care for Tess due to his loneliness , and Johnson convinced Druckmann that Ellie should be stronger and more defensive . Ellie 's physical appearance was also redesigned throughout development to make her look more similar to Johnson . The game 's other characters also underwent changes . The character Tess was originally intended to be the main antagonist of The Last of Us , but the team found it difficult to believe her motives . The sexuality of the character Bill was originally left vague in the script , but later altered to further reflect his homosexuality . </P> Argentinian musician Gustavo Santaolalla composed and performed the score for The Last of Us . <P> The Last of Us features an original score composed primarily by Gustavo Santaolalla , along with compositions by Andrew Buresh , Anthony Caruso , and Jonathan Mayer . Known for his minimalist compositions , Santaolalla was contacted early in development . He used various instruments to compose the score , including some that he was unfamiliar with , giving a sense of danger and innocence . This minimalist approach was also taken with the game 's sound and art design . The sound of the Infected was one of the first tasks during development ; the team experimented with the sound in order to achieve the best work possible . To achieve the sound of the Clicker , they hired voice actress Misty Lee , who provided a sound that audio lead Phillip Kovats described as originating in the `` back of the throat '' . The art department took various pieces of work as inspiration , such as Robert Polidori 's photographs following Hurricane Katrina , which were used as a reference point when designing the flooded areas of Pittsburgh . The art department were forced to negotiate for things that they wished to include , due to the strong differing opinions of the team during development . Ultimately , the team settled on a balance between simplicity and detail ; while Straley and Druckmann preferred the former , the art team preferred the latter . The game 's opening credits were produced by Sony 's San Diego Studio . </P> <P> The team created new engines to satisfy their needs for the game . The artificial intelligence was created to coordinate with players ; the addition of Ellie as artificial intelligence was a major contributor to the engine . The lighting engine was also re-created to incorporate soft light , in which the sunlight seeps in through spaces and reflects off surfaces . The gameplay introduced difficulty to the team , as they felt that every mechanic required thorough analysis . The game 's user interface design also underwent various iterations throughout development . </P> <P> The Last of Us was announced on December 10 , 2011 , at the Spike Video Game Awards , alongside its debut trailer and an official press release acknowledging some of the game 's features . The announcement ignited widespread anticipation within the gaming industry , which journalists owed to Naughty Dog 's reputation . The game missed its original projected release date of May 7 , 2013 , and was pushed to June 14 , 2013 worldwide for further polishing . To promote pre-order sales , Naughty Dog collaborated with several retailers to provide special editions of the game with extra content . </P> <H3> Additional content ( edit ) </H3> <P> Downloadable content ( DLC ) for the game was released following its launch . The game 's Season Pass includes access to all DLC , as well as some additional abilities , and the documentary Grounded : Making The Last of Us ; the documentary was released online in February 2014 . Two DLC packs were included with some of the game 's special editions and were available upon release . The Sights and Sounds Pack included the soundtrack , a dynamic theme for the PlayStation 3 home screen , and two avatars . The Survival Pack featured bonus skins for the player following the completion of the campaign , and in - game money , as well as bonus experience points and early access to customizable items for the game 's multiplayer . Abandoned Territories Map Pack , released on October 15 , 2013 , added four new multiplayer maps , based on locations in the game 's story . Nightmare Bundle , released on November 5 , 2013 , added a collection of ten head items , nine of which are available to purchase separately . </P> <P> The Last of Us : Left Behind adds a single - player campaign which serves as a prequel to the main storyline , featuring Ellie and her friend Riley . It was released on February 14 , 2014 as DLC and on May 12 , 2015 as a standalone expansion pack . A third bundle was released on May 6 , 2014 , featuring five separate DLC : Grounded added a new difficulty to the main game and Left Behind ; Reclaimed Territories Map Pack added new multiplayer maps ; Professional Survival Skills Bundle and Situational Survival Skills Bundle added eight new multiplayer skills ; and Survivalist Weapon Bundle added four new weapons . The Grit and Gear Bundle , which added new headgear items , masks and gestures , was released on August 5 , 2014 . A Game of the Year Edition containing all downloadable content was released in Europe on November 11 , 2014 . </P> <H3> The Last of Us Remastered ( edit ) </H3> Main article : The Last of Us Remastered <P> On April 9 , 2014 , Sony announced The Last of Us Remastered , an enhanced version of the game for the PlayStation 4 . It was released on July 29 , 2014 in North America .

Kelly of Computer and Video Games named the characters `` richly painted '' , feeling invested in their stories . Philip Kollar of Polygon felt that Ellie was believable , making it easier to develop a connection to her , and that the relationship between the characters was assisted by the game 's optional conversations . The character performances also received praise , with Edge and Eurogamer 's Welsh noting that the script improved as a result . </P> <P> Many reviewers found the game 's combat a refreshing difference from other games . Game Informer 's Helgeson appreciated the vulnerability during fights , while Kelly of Computer and Video Games enjoyed the variety in approaching the combat . IGN 's Moriarty felt that the crafting system assisted the combat , and that the latter contributed to the narrative 's emotional value , adding that enemies feel `` human '' . Joystiq 's Mitchell reiterated similar comments , stating that the combat `` piles death upon death on Joel 's hands '' . Welsh of Eurogamer found the suspenseful and threatening encounters added positively to the gameplay . Tom Mc Shea of GameSpot wrote that the artificial intelligence negatively affected the combat , with enemies often ignoring players ' companions . Polygon 's Kollar felt that the combat was unfair , especially when fighting the Infected . </P> An artistic design of a location in the post-apocalyptic United States . Reviewers praised the design and layouts of the locations . The game 's visual features , both artistic and graphic , were also well received . <P> The game 's visual features were commended by many reviewers . The art design was lauded as `` outstanding '' by Computer and Video Games ' Kelly , and `` jaw - dropping '' by Eurogamer 's Welsh . In contrast , Mc Shea of GameSpot identified the visual representation of the post-apocalyptic world was `` mundane '' , having been portrayed various times previously . The game 's graphics have been frequently named by critics as the best for a PlayStation 3 game , with Helgeson of Game Informer naming them `` unmatched in console gaming '' and Moriarty of IGN stating that they contribute to the realism . Destructoid 's Sterling wrote that game was visually impressive but that technical issues , such as some `` muddy and basic '' textures found early in the game , left a negative impact on the visuals . </P> <P> The world and environments of the game drew acclaim from many reviewers . Kelly of Computer and Video Games stated that the environments are `` large , detailed , and littered with secrets '' , adding that The Last of Us `` masks '' its linearity successfully .

Both Game Informer 's Helgeson and Destructoid 's Sterling called the score `` haunting '' , with the latter finding that it complements the gameplay . </P> <P> The graphic depiction of violence in The Last of Us generated substantial commentary from critics . Engadget writer Ben Gilbert found the game 's persistent focus on combat was `` a necessary evil to lead the game 's fragile protagonist duo to safety '' , as opposed to being used as a method to achieve objectives . Kotaku 's Kirk Hamilton wrote that the violence was `` heavy , consequential and necessary '' , as opposed to gratuitous . USGamer 's Anthony John Agnello wrote that the game consistently reinforces the negativity associated with violence , intentionally making players feel uncomfortable while in violent combat . He stated that the deaths within the game were not unnecessary or unjustified , making the story more powerful . Kelly of Computer and Video Games stated that , despite the `` incredibly brutal '' combat , the violence never felt gratuitous . Eurogamer 's Welsh echoed similar remarks , stating that the violence is not `` desensitized or mindless '' . Matt Helgeson of Game Informer observed that the game 's violence leads to players questioning the morality of their choices . Joystiq 's Mitchell wrote that the violence is `` designed to be uncomfortable '' , stating that it contributes to Joel 's character . Prior to the release of the game , Keith Stuart of The Guardian wrote that the acceptability of the violence would depend on its context within the game . </P> <P> Many critics discussed the game 's depiction of female characters . Jason Killingsworth of Edge praised its lack of sexualized female characters , writing that it `` offers a refreshing antidote to the sexism and regressive gender attitudes of most blockbuster videogames '' . Eurogamer 's Ellie Gibson praised Ellie as `` sometimes strong , sometimes vulnerable , but never a clich\u00e9 '' . She felt that Ellie is initially established as a `` damsel in distress '' , but that this concept is subverted . GameSpot 's Carolyn Petit praised the female characters as morally conflicted and sympathetic , but wrote that gender in video games should be evaluated `` based on their actual merits , not in relation to other games '' . Chris Suellentrop of The New York Times acknowledged that Ellie was a likable and `` sometimes powerful '' character , but argued that The Last of Us is `` actually the story of Joel '' , stating that it 's `` another video game by men , for men and about men '' . The Last of Us was also praised for its depiction of LGBT characters . Sam Einhorn of GayGamer.net felt that the revelation of Bill 's sexuality `` added to his character ... without really tokenizing him '' . American organization GLAAD named Bill one of the `` most intriguing new LGBT characters of 2013 '' , calling him `` deeply flawed but wholly unique '' .

Very little work occurred following this , as Druckmann stated in April 2016 that the film had entered development hell . In November 2016 , Raimi stated that the film was at a standstill after Sony had a disagreement with Druckmann . Actress Maisie Williams expressed enthusiasm in playing Ellie , and was in talks with both Druckmann and Raimi to take the role . </P> <H2> Sequel ( edit ) </H2> Main article : The Last of Us Part II <P> In February 2014 , Druckmann said Naughty Dog were considering a sequel but needed to find a story `` really worth telling , and that 's not repeating itself '' . In September 2015 , Druckmann stated that a small team had begun building prototypes , but shifted development to Uncharted 4 : A Thief 's End , released in May 2016 . </P> <P> Sony announced The Last of Us Part II at the PlayStation Experience event on December 3 , 2016 . The story takes place about five years after the first game ; Ellie and Joel return , with players controlling Ellie . Santaolalla will return to compose the music , and Druckmann will return to write the story alongside Halley Gross . Straley will not return as game director . </P> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Notes ( edit ) </H3> <Ol> <Li> ^ Jump up to : The Last of Us Remastered was released on different dates , dependent on territory : July 29 , 2014 in North America ; July 30 , 2014 in Europe , Australia and New Zealand ; and August 1 , 2014 in the United Kingdom and Ireland . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ The Last of Us shares its status as fifth - highest rated PlayStation 3 game on Metacritic with Red Dead Redemption ( 2010 ) , Portal 2 ( 2011 ) and LittleBigPlanet ( 2008 ) .
