They are formed to perform a single function or a set of related functions . The term special district governments as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau excludes school districts . In 2007 , the U.S. had more than 39,000 special district governments . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Definition of `` Special District '' by the United States Census </Li> <Li> 2 Characteristics <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Areas served </Li> <Li> 2.2 Governing body </Li> <Li> 2.3 Functions </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Legal basis <Ul> <Li> 3.1 English custom </Li> <Li> 3.2 State law </Li> <Li> 3.3 Public foundation </Li> <Li> 3.4 Civil office </Li> <Li> 3.5 Accountability </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 History </Li> <Li> 5 Trends </Li> <Li> 6 Examples </Li> <Li> 7 See also </Li> <Li> 8 References </Li> <Li> 9 Further reading </Li> <Li> 10 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Definition of `` special district '' by the United States Census ( edit ) </H2> <P> The United States Census counts government units across all States . This includes `` special districts . '' To count the special districts the Census must define the special districts so as to address all such governmental entities across the broad spectrum of 50 states ' definitions and interpretations . The Census 's full definition is : </P> <P> Special district governments are independent , special purpose governmental units , other than school district governments , that exist as separate entities with substantial administrative and fiscal independence from general purpose local governments . As defined for Census Bureau statistics on governments , the term ' ' special district governments ' ' excludes school district governments as they are defined as a separate governmental type . </P> <P> Special district governments provide specific services that are not being supplied by existing general purpose governments . Most perform a single function , but in some instances , their enabling legislation allows them to provide several , usually related , types of services . The services provided by these districts range from such basic social needs as hospitals and fire protection , to the less conspicuous tasks of mosquito abatement and upkeep of cemeteries . </P> <P> The Census Bureau classification of special district governments covers a wide variety of entities , most of which are officially called districts or authorities . Not all public agencies so termed , however , represent separate governments . Many entities that carry the designation ' ' district ' ' or ' ' authority ' ' are , by law , so closely related to county , municipal , town or township , or state governments that they are classified as subordinate agencies of those governments in Census Bureau statistics on governments , and are not counted as separate special district governments . </P> <P> In order to be classified as a special district government , rather than as a subordinate agency , an entity must possess three attributes -- existence as an organized entity , governmental character , and substantial autonomy . Each state description also lists various statutory authorities , commissions , corporations , and other forms of organizations that have certain governmental characteristics , but are subject by law to administrative or fiscal control by the state or by independent local governments ; therefore , they are classified as subordinate agencies of those governments . </P> <H2> Characteristics ( edit ) </H2> <P> Special districts serve limited areas and have governing boards that accomplish legislatively assigned functions using public funds . </P> <H3> Areas served ( edit ) </H3> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> This section does not cite any sources .

Please improve this article or discuss the issue on the talk page . ( July 2016 ) </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> Special districts provide specialized services to persons living within the designated geographic area and may contract to provide services outside the area . Special districts often cross the lines of towns , villages , and hamlets but less frequently cross city or county lines . Increasingly , however , regional special districts are being created that may serve a large portion of a state or portions of more than one state . </P> <H3> Governing body ( edit ) </H3> <P> Each district is governed by a board of directors , commissioners , board of supervisors , or the like . These boards may be appointed by public officials , appointed by private entities , popularly elected , or elected by benefited citizens ( typically , property owners ) . Sometimes , one or more public officials will serve as an ex officio member on the board . </P> <P> The board of a special district serves primarily as a managing board and often appoints a chief executive for day - to - day operations and decision making and policy implementation . In the New England states , special districts are often run in the same town meeting fashion as other local governments . Most districts have employees , but some districts exist solely to raise funds by issuing bonds and / or by providing tax increment financing . </P> <H3> Functions ( edit ) </H3> <P> Special districts perform many functions including airports , ports , highways , mass transit , parking facilities , fire protection , libraries , parks , cemeteries , hospitals , irrigation , conservation , sewerage , wastewater treatment , solid waste , fiber optic systems , stadiums , water supply , electric power , and natural gas utility . </P> <H2> Legal basis ( edit ) </H2> <P> Originated from English custom , special districts are authorized by state law and must have public foundation , civil office , and public accountability . </P> <H3> English custom ( edit ) </H3> <P> Special districts in the United States follow the English custom . The earliest known general law in England authorizing special purpose authorities was the Statute of Sewers of 1532 . Single purpose authorities created by individual charters also existed at the time . However , the early authorities were temporary and unconnected to local government structure . The first laws authorizing permanent authorities connected to local governments were the Incorporated Guardians of the Poor , which were created by special acts in the 17th century . Turnpike trusts were an early and popular special purpose authority in England . Internal drainage boards are current examples in parts of England and Wales . </P> <H3> State law ( edit ) </H3> <P> Special districts in the United States are founded by some level of government in accordance with state law ( either constitutional amendment , general law , or special acts ) and exist in all states . Special districts are legally separate entities with at least some corporate powers . Districts are created by legislative action , court action , or public referendum . The procedures for creating a special district may include procedures such as petitions , hearings , voter or landowner approval , or government approval . Tribal governments may create special districts pursuant to state law and may serve on the boards of special districts . </P> <H3> Public foundation ( edit ) </H3> <P> Special districts , like all public entities , have public foundation . The landmark case of the U.S. Supreme Court addressing public versus private charters was Dartmouth College v. Woodward in 1819 . Dartmouth established the fundamental differences between public and private organizations . Critically , a government must be founded by all of the people of a governmental area or by their governmental representatives . </P> <H3> Civil office ( edit ) </H3> <P> Special districts possess some form of civil office , that is , the board has received a delegation of sovereign power from the state . Some boards may be appointed by only landowners . Private entities may appoint some or all of the members of a special district ; however , there must be evidence of civil office . In addition to special districts with privately appointed boards , a special district may have a privately founded board ; however , such a board could not be given the power to set a tax . </P> <H3> Accountability ( edit ) </H3> <P> There is a citizen - government fiscal accountability relationship . To maintain accountability for special districts , states must maintain ultimate control ( the power to repeal the authorizing law at any time ) . Due to public foundation and , thus , ultimate control , the state can freely delegate sovereign power ( such as the power to tax ) to special districts and can allow them to act autonomously with little supervision . </P> <H2> History ( edit ) </H2> <P> There is little information available on the earliest special districts in the United States . It is known that park districts existed in the 18th century . Toll road and canal corporations existed in the 19th century . The first general statute authorizing irrigation districts was adopted by California in 1887 . The U.S. Census Bureau began identifying and collecting data on special districts in 1942 . </P> <H2> Trends ( edit ) </H2> <P> The state of Illinois leads the nation in the number of special districts with California close behind . State counts of their special districts may differ from the federal count because the states may have different definitions of a special district than the U.S. Census Bureau . </P> <H2> Examples ( edit ) </H2> <P> All of the following examples have been found by the U.S. Census Bureau to be special districts .
