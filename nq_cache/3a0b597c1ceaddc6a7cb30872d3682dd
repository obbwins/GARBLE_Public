The thick plate of epithelium extends deeply , pushing before it the mesoderm and forming a distinct projection . This is termed the gonadal ridge . The gonadal ridge , in turn , develops into a gonad . This is a testis in the male and an ovary in the female . </P> <P> At first , the mesonephros and gonadal ridge are continuous , but as the embryo grows the gonadal ridge gradually becomes pinched off from the mesonephros . However , some cells of mesonephric origin join the gonadal ridge . Furthermore , the gonadal ridge still remains connected to the remnant of that body by a fold of peritoneum , namely the mesorchium or mesovarium . About the seventh week the distinction of sex in the gonadal ridge begins to be perceptible . </P> <H2> Ovary ( edit ) </H2> <P> The ovary is thus formed mainly from the genital ridge and partly from the mesonephros . Later the mass is differentiated into a central part , the medulla of ovary , covered by a surface layer , the germinal epithelium . Between the cells of the germinal epithelium a number of larger cells , the immature ova , are found . The immature ova , in turn , are carried into the stroma beneath by bud - like ingrowths ( genital cords of the germinal epithelium ) . The surface germinal epithelium ultimately forms the permanent epithelial covering of this organ . Furthermore , it soon loses its connection with the central mass . Instead , the tunica albuginea of the ovaries develops between them . </P> <H3> Origin of ova ( edit ) </H3> <P> During early embryonic development , cells from the dorsal endoderm of the yolk sac migrate along the hindgut to the gonadal ridge . These primordial germ cells ( PGCs ) multiply by mitosis and once they have reached the gonadal ridge they are called oogonia ( diploid stem cells of the ovary ) . </P> <P> Once oogonia enter this area they attempt to associate with the other somatic cells , derived from both the peritoneum and mesonephros . Development proceeds and the oogonia become fully surrounded by a layer of connective tissue cells ( pre-granulosa cells ) in an irregular manner . In this way , the rudiments of the ovarian follicles are formed . </P> <H3> Origin of granulosa cells ( edit ) </H3> <P> The embryological origin of granulosa cells remains controversial . In the 1970s , evidence emerged that the first cells to make contact with the oogonia were of mesonephric origin . It was suggested that mesonephric cells already closely associated with the oogonia proliferated throughout development to form the granulosa cell layer . </P> <P> Recently this hypothesis has been challenged with some thorough histology . Sawyer et al. hypothesized that in sheep most of the granulosa cells develop from cells of the mesothelium ( i.e. , epithelial cells from the presumptive surface epithelium of the ovary ) . </P> <H3> Descent of the ovaries ( edit ) </H3> <P> Just as in the male , there is a gubernaculum in the female , which effects a considerable change in the position of the ovary , though not so extensive a change as in that of the testis . The gubernaculum in the female lies in contact with the fundus of the uterus and adheres to this organ , and thus the ovary can only descend as far as to this level . The part of the gubernaculum between the ovary and the uterus ultimately becomes the proper ovarian ligament , while the part between the uterus and the labium majus forms the round ligament of the uterus . A pouch of peritoneum analogous to the processus vaginalis in the male accompanies it along the inguinal canal : it is called the canal of Nuck . </P> Pathology ( edit ) <P> In rare cases , the gubernaculum may fail to contract adhesions to the uterus , and then the ovary descends through the inguinal canal into the labium majus ; under these circumstances , its position resembles that of the testis . </P> <H2> Testis ( edit ) </H2> <P> The testis is developed in much the same way as the ovary , originating from mesothelium as well as mesonephros . Like the ovary , in its earliest stages it consists of a central mass covered by a surface epithelium . In the central mass a series of cords appear , and the periphery of the mass is converted into the tunica albuginea , thus excluding the surface epithelium from any part in the formation of the tissue of the testis . The cords of the central mass run together toward the future hilum and form a network which ultimately becomes the rete testis . On the other hand , the seminiferous tubules are developed from the cords distal to the hilum , and between them connective - tissue septa extend . Via the rete testis , the seminiferous tubules become connected with outgrowths from the mesonephros , which form the efferent ducts of the testis . </P> <H3> Descent of the testes ( edit ) </H3> <P> The descent of the testes consists of the opening of a connection from the testis to its final location at the anterior abdominal wall , followed by the development of the gubernaculum , which subsequently pulls and translocates the testis down into the developing scrotum . Ultimately , the passageway closes behind the testis . </P> Opening of connection ( edit ) <P> At an early period of fetal life the testes are placed at the back part of abdominal cavity , behind the peritoneum , and each is attached by a peritoneal fold , the mesorchium , to the mesonephros . From the front of the mesonephros a fold of peritoneum termed the inguinal fold grows forward to meet and fuse with a peritoneal fold , the inguinal crest , which grows backward from the antero - lateral abdominal wall . The testis thus acquires an indirect connection with the anterior abdominal wall . At the same time , a portion of the peritoneal cavity lateral to these fused folds is marked off as the future saccus vaginalis . </P> Development of gubernaculum ( edit ) <P> Also , in the inguinal crest a structure , the gubernaculum testis , makes its appearance . This is at first a slender band , extending from that part of the skin of the groin which afterward forms the scrotum through the inguinal canal to the body and epididymis of the testis . As development advances , the peritoneum enclosing the gubernaculum forms two folds , one above the testis and the other below it . The one above the testis is the plica vascularis , and contains the upper part of the gubernaculum , and ultimately also the internal spermatic vessels ; the one below , the plica gubernatrix , contains the lower part of the gubernaculum . </P> <P> The gubernaculum grows into a thick cord . It ends below at the abdominal inguinal ring in a tube of peritoneum , the saccus vaginalis , which protrudes itself down the inguinal canal . By the fifth month the lower part of the gubernaculum still is a thick cord , while the upper part has disappeared . The lower part now consists of a central core of smooth muscle fibers , surrounded by a firm layer of striated muscle elements , connected , behind the peritoneum , with the abdominal wall . </P> Translocation ( edit ) <P> As the testes develops , the main portion of the lower end of the gubernaculum is carried , following the skin to which it is attached , to the bottom of this pouch . Other bands are carried to the medial side of the thigh and to the perineum . The tube of peritoneum constituting the saccus vaginalis projects itself downward into the inguinal canal , and emerges at the external inguinal ring , pushing before it a part of the obliquus internus and the aponeurosis of the obliquus externus , which form respectively the cremaster muscle and the external spermatic fascia . The saccus vaginalis forms a gradually elongating pouch , which eventually reaches the bottom of the scrotum , and behind this pouch the testis is drawn by the growth of the body of the fetus , for the gubernaculum does not grow proportionately with the growth of other parts , and therefore the testis , being attached by the gubernaculum to the bottom of the scrotum , is prevented from rising as the body grows , and is instead drawn first into the inguinal canal and eventually into the scrotum . It seems certain also that the gubernacular cord becomes shortened as development proceeds , and this assists in causing the testis to reach the bottom of the scrotum . </P> Closing of connection ( edit ) Diagram of an indirect , scrotal inguinal hernia ( median view from the left ) . <P> By the end of the eighth month the testis has reached the scrotum , preceded by the saccus vaginalis , which communicates by its upper extremity with the peritoneal cavity . Just before birth the upper part of the saccus vaginalis , at the internal inguinal ring , usually becomes closed , and this obliteration extends gradually downward to within a short distance of the testis . The process of peritoneum surrounding the testis is now entirely cut off from the general peritoneal cavity and constitutes the tunica vaginalis . </P> Pathology ( edit ) <P> If the internal inguinal ring does not close properly , then there is a risk that other contents of the abdominal cavity protrudes through the passageway and cause indirect inguinal hernia . </P> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Sexual differentiation in humans </Li> </Ul> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ Satoh M ( 1991 ) . `` Histogenesis and organogenesis of the gonad in human embryos '' .
