His surname means `` midnight '' in French . He was Director of the Dutch North American colony of New Netherland from 1626 until 1631 , and founded the Swedish colony of New Sweden on the Delaware Peninsula in 1638 . </P> <P> Minuit is generally credited with orchestrating the purchase of Manhattan Island for the Dutch from the Lenape Native Americans . Manhattan later became the site of the Dutch city of New Amsterdam , and the borough of Manhattan of modern - day New York City . A common account states that Minuit purchased Manhattan for $24 worth of trinkets . A letter written by Dutch merchant Peter Schaghen to directors of the Dutch East India Company stated that Manhattan was purchased `` for the value of 60 guilders '' in goods , an amount worth approximately $1,050 in 2015 dollars . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Biography <Ul> <Li> 1.1 Early life </Li> <Li> 1.2 As director of New Netherland </Li> <Li> 1.3 Establishing the New Sweden colony </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 Legacy <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Places named after Minuit </Li> <Li> 2.2 In popular culture </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 See also </Li> <Li> 4 References <Ul> <Li> 4.1 Notes </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 5 Further reading </Li> <Li> 6 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Biography ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Early life ( edit ) </H3> <P> Peter Minuit was born sometime between 1580 and 1585 , into a Calvinist family that had moved from the city of Tournai ( presently part of Wallonia , Belgium ) in the Southern Netherlands , to Wesel in Germany , in order to avoid Spanish Catholic colonials , who were not favorably disposed toward Protestants . </P> <P> His father , Johan , died in 1609 and Peter took over management of the household and his father 's business . Peter had a good reputation in Wesel , attested by the fact that he was several times appointed a guardian . He also assisted the poor during the Spanish occupation of 1614 -- 1619 . </P> <P> Minuit married Gertrude Raedts on August 20 , 1613 . Gertrude was from a wealthy family and she probably helped Peter Minuit establish himself as a broker . A will drawn up in 1615 in the Dutch city of Utrecht , mentions `` Peter Minnewit '' as a diamond cutter . Whether he traded in other items is unknown . </P> <P> By 1624 , the city was in an economic decline and in 1625 , he had left Wesel and like others , went to Holland . At first , Gertrude went to stay with her relatives in Cleve . </P> <H3> As director of New Netherland ( edit ) </H3> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> This section needs additional citations for verification .

He returned in the same year , and in 1626 was appointed the new director of New Netherland , taking over from Willem Verhulst . He sailed to North America and arrived in the colony on May 4 , 1626 . </P> <P> Minuit is credited with purchasing the island of Manhattan from the Native Americans in exchange for traded goods valued at 60 guilders . According to the writer Nathaniel Benchley , Minuit conducted the transaction with Seyseys , chief of the Canarsees , who were only too happy to accept valuable merchandise in exchange for an island that was mostly controlled by the Weckquaesgeeks . </P> <P> The figure of 60 guilders comes from a letter by a representative of the Dutch States - General and member of the board of the Dutch West India Company , Pieter Janszoon Schagen , to the States - General in November 1626 . In 1846 , New York historian John Romeyn Brodhead converted the figure of Fl 60 ( or 60 guilders ) to US $ 23 . The popular account rounds this off to $24 . By 2006 sixty guilders in 1626 was worth approximately $1,000 in current dollars , according to the Institute for Social History of Amsterdam . </P> <P> According to researchers at the National Library of the Netherlands , `` The original inhabitants of the area were unfamiliar with the European notions and definitions of ownership rights . For the Indians , water , air and land could not be traded . Such exchanges would also be difficult in practical terms because many groups migrated between their summer and winter quarters . It can be concluded that both parties probably went home with totally different interpretations of the sales agreement . '' </P> <P> A contemporary purchase of rights in nearby Staten Island , to which Minuit also was party , involved duffel cloth , iron kettles , axe heads , hoes , wampum , drilling awls , `` Jew 's harps '' , and `` diverse other wares '' . `` If similar trade goods were involved in the Manhattan arrangement '' , Burrows and Wallace surmise , `` then the Dutch were engaged in high - end technology transfer , handing over equipment of enormous usefulness in tasks ranging from clearing land to drilling wampum . '' </P> <P> Minuit conducted politics in a measure of democracy in the colony during his time in New Netherland . He was highest judge in the colony , but in both civil and criminal affairs he was assisted by a council of five colonists . This advisory body would advise the director and jointly with him would develop , administer , and adjudicate a body of laws to help govern the colony . In addition there was a schout - fiscal , half - sheriff , half - attorney - general , and the customs officer . During Minuit 's administration , several mills were built , trade grew exponentially , and the population grew to almost 300 . </P> <P> In 1631 , the Dutch West India Company ( WIC ) suspended Minuit from his post for reasons that are unclear , but probably for ( perhaps unintentionally ) abetting the landowning patroons who were engaging in illegal fur trade and otherwise enriching themselves against the interests and orders of the West India Company . He arrived back in Europe in August 1632 to explain his actions , but was dismissed and was succeeded as director by Wouter van Twiller . It is possible that Minuit had become the victim of the internal disputes over the rights that the board of directors had given to the patroons . </P> <H3> Establishing the New Sweden colony ( edit ) </H3> <P> After having lived in Cleves , Germany for several years , Minuit made arrangements with Samuel Blommaert and the Swedish government in 1636 or 1637 to create the first Swedish colony in the New World . Located on the lower Delaware River within territory earlier claimed by the Dutch , it was called New Sweden . Minuit and his company arrived on the Fogel Grip and Kalmar Nyckel at Swedes ' Landing ( now Wilmington , Delaware ) , in the spring of 1638 . They constructed Fort Christina later that year , then returned to Stockholm for a second load of colonists , and made a side trip to the Caribbean on the return to pick up a shipment of tobacco for resale in Europe to make the voyage profitable . During this voyage , Minuit drowned when the ship he was visiting ( at the invitation of it 's dutch captain , a friend of Minuit ) , The Flying Deer , was lost with all hands during a hurricane at St. Christopher ( today 's St. Kitts ) in the Caribbean . The losses suffered , such as goods , colonists , and Minuit , caused irreversible damage to Sweden 's colonization attempts . Two years later , Swedish Lt. M\u00e5ns Nilsson Kling , whose rank was raised to captain , replaced him as governor . Nine expeditions to the colony were carried out before the Dutch captured it in 1655 . </P> <H2> Legacy ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Places named after Minuit ( edit ) </H3> <Ul> <Li> The Staten Island Ferry Whitehall Terminal 's Peter Minuit Plaza , north of the South Ferry -- Whitehall Street station ( 1 , \u200b 2 \u200b , N , \u200b R , and \u200b W trains ) . Following the 400th anniversary celebrations of Henry Hudson 's voyage to Manhattan , a pavilion was opened there to honor the Dutch .

'' ( meaning `` okay '' in his jargon ) for he knew poor Pete was skinned . '' </Li> <Li> One version of Minuit was played by Groucho Marx in the 1957 comedy film The Story of Mankind . </Li> <Li> Minuit is mentioned on the HBO drama Boardwalk Empire , where the character Edward Bader tells a joke featuring the line , `` ' 50 bucks ? ' the fella says . ' Peter Stuyvesant only paid 24 for the entire island of Manhattan ! ' '' , while Steve Buscemi 's ' character Enoch ' Nucky ' Thompson has to correct Bader and inform him that it was in fact Peter Minuit who bought Manhattan , not Stuyvesant . </Li> <Li> Bob Dylan mentions Minuit in his song `` Hard Times in New York Town '' ( released on The Bootleg Series Volume 1 ) in the following line : Mister Hudson come a-sailing down the stream , / and old Mister Minuit paid for his dream . In the released recording of the song , however , Dylan spoonerizes `` Mister Minuit '' by mispronouncing his name as `` Minnie Mistuit . '' The official lyrics have the correct version of the name , except that Minuit is spelled `` Minuet . '' </Li> <Li> Minuit is mentioned in the first episode , Uno , of the AMC drama Better Call Saul . Jimmy McGill ( the later titular Saul ) , while confronting lawyers at his brother 's law firm , accuses them of being `` like Peter Minuit '' and suggests that they `` throw in some beads and shells '' to the $26,000.00 being given to his brother . </Li> </Ul> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Dutch colonization of the Americas </Li> <Li> Dutch Empire </Li> <Li> List of colonial governors of New Jersey </Li> <Li> List of colonial governors of New York </Li> </Ul> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Notes ( edit ) </H3> <Ol> <Li> ^ Jump up to : Nevius , James ; Nevius , Michelle ( 2014 ) .
