The series ran from 1960 to 1965 on ABC , and moved to CBS until its end on April 13 , 1972 . My Three Sons chronicles the life of widower and aeronautical engineer Steven Douglas ( Fred MacMurray ) as he raises his three sons . </P> <P> The series originally featured William Frawley as the boys ' live - in maternal grandfather , William Michael Francis `` Bub '' O'Casey . William Demarest , playing Bub 's brother , `` Charley '' , replaced Frawley in 1965 due to Frawley 's illness . In September 1965 , eldest son Mike married , and his character was written out of the show . To keep the emphasis on `` three sons '' , a new son named Ernie was adopted . In the program 's final years , Steven Douglas remarried and adopted his new wife 's young daughter Dorothy ( `` Dodie '' ) . </P> <P> The series was a cornerstone of the ABC and CBS lineups in the 1960s . With 380 episodes produced , it is second only to The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet ( 14 seasons , 1952 - 1966 , 434 episodes ) and tied with It 's Always Sunny in Philadelphia ( 12 seasons ) as television 's longest - running live - action sitcom . Disney producer Bill Walsh often mused on whether the concept of the show was inspired by the movie The Shaggy Dog , as in his view they shared `` the same dog , the same kids , and Fred MacMurray '' . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 History <Ul> <Li> 1.1 ABC years </Li> <Li> 1.2 Directors </Li> <Li> 1.3 CBS years </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 Cast <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Main cast </Li> <Li> 2.2 Recurring cast </Li> <Li> 2.3 Musical connections </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Episodes </Li> <Li> 4 Broadcast history </Li> <Li> 5 Production schedule </Li> <Li> 6 Distribution </Li> <Li> 7 Reunion special </Li> <Li> 8 DVD releases </Li> <Li> 9 References </Li> <Li> 10 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> History ( edit ) </H2> The ABC cast of My Three Sons , with William Frawley , circa 1962 <H3> ABC years ( edit ) </H3> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> This section does not cite any sources .

( June 2017 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> The show began on ABC in black - and - white . The first season , consisting of 36 episodes , was directed in its entirety by Peter Tewksbury , who produced and occasionally scripted the programs . </P> <P> These early episodes held to no specific generic type , so that any episode from one week to the next might be either comedic or dramatic . Tewksbury 's episodes are also unusual for their use of cross-talk ( a way of having the voices of off - screen characters heard in the background of the soundtrack , just under the voices of the main characters ) . Using this clever directorial twist , Tewksbury realistically portrayed the chaotic , fast - paced , and ever - changing sequence of events ; coordinate and conflicting , that was the daily routine of living in the Douglas household . </P> <P> An example of Tewksbury 's use of cross-talk is the fourth episode , `` Countdown '' , written by David Duncan , which chronicles the Douglas family 's attempts to wake up , prepare for the day , have breakfast , and get out of the house by a common , agreed - upon time , all carefully synchronized to a televised rocket launch countdown -- to comical and often ironic effect . Tewksbury returned to directing feature films after concluding the season because the producers could not handle his perfectionist attitude , which was costing thousands of dollars in lost time and reshoots . </P> <P> During the 1964 fall season , William Frawley , who played Bub , was declared too ill to work by Desilu Studios , as the company was informed that insuring the actor would be too costly . Frawley continued in the role until a suitable replacement could be found at midseason . He was replaced by William Demarest , who had played his hard - nosed brother ( great ) Uncle Charley part way through the 1964 - 1965 season ( the last on ABC ) . According to the storyline , Bub returns to Ireland to help his Auntie Kate celebrate her 104th birthday . Soon after , brother Charley visits and stays on . Charley , a cello - playing merchant sailor , was a soft - hearted curmudgeon , who proved to be a responsible caregiver . Frawley left the series before the end of the 1964 - 1965 season . </P> <H3> Directors ( edit ) </H3> <P> Peter Tewksbury directed the first season . The succeeding director , Richard Whorf , took over the reins for one season and was in turn followed by former actor - turned - director Gene Reynolds from 1962 to 1964 . James V. Kern , an experienced Hollywood television director who had previously helmed the `` Hollywood '' and `` Europe '' episodes of I Love Lucy , continued in this role for two years until his untimely death in late 1966 , aged 57 . Director James Sheldon was also contracted to finish episodes that had been partly completed by Kern to complete that season . Fred De Cordova was the show 's longest and most consistent director of the series ( 108 episodes ) until he left in 1971 to produce The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson . Earl Bellamy rounded out the series as director of the show 's final year . </P> <H3> CBS years ( edit ) </H3> <P> My Three Sons moved to the CBS television network for the 1965 - 1966 season after ABC declined to commit to underwriting the expense of producing the program in color . Along with the change in networks and the transition to color , Tim Considine ( who had earlier worked with Fred MacMurray on The Shaggy Dog ) , playing eldest son Mike , had chosen not to renew his contract due to a clash with executive producer Don Fedderson over Considine 's wish to direct but not co-star in the series . ( Considine did , however , direct one of the last black - and - white episodes for ABC . ) According to Considine ( Pat Sajak Show , August 1989 ) , he also was devoted to automobile racing , which his contract forbade . His character was written out , along with Meredith MacRae , who had played his fiancee Sally , in a wedding episode that was the premiere of the 1965 -- 1966 season on CBS . After this episode , which was the program 's first in color , Mike is mentioned briefly in only four succeeding episodes ( including one in which Ernie becomes adopted ) , and is never seen again , even at Robbie and Steve 's weddings . In the episode `` Steve and the Huntress '' ( first aired January 27 , 1966 ) , Mike is specifically mentioned as teaching at a college . MacRae joined Petticoat Junction the following year , the last of three actresses to play Billie Jo Bradley . </P> <P> To keep the show 's title plausible , the show 's head writer , George Tibbles , fashioned a three - part story arc in which an orphaned friend of youngest brother Richard ( Chip , played by Stanley Livingston ) , Ernie Thompson ( played by his real - life brother , Barry Livingston ) , awaits adoption when his current foster parents are transferred to the Orient . Steve offers to adopt Ernie , but faces antagonism from Uncle Charley , who finds Ernie a bit grating , and forecasts major headaches over both the boy and his dog . It also transpires that a law requires a woman to live in the home of an adoptive family . A likable female social worker supervises the case , and the Douglases speculate that Steve might marry the woman , to make the adoption possible , but they both agree this is not reason enough for them to be married . The family also does not need to hire a housekeeper , since Uncle Charley already has things running smoothly . The family soon appears before a judge who researches the law , and determines that its intent is to ensure a full - time caregiver is in the household . With Charley meeting that role , and having had a change of heart about Ernie , Charley assents to a legal fiction declaring him `` housemother '' to the Douglas family . </P> <P> While the three sons were always central to the storyline , several major changes took place by the late 1960s . In the spring of 1967 , the ratings for the series began to sag and My Three Sons finished its seventh season in 31st place in the Nielsen ratings . It was decided that the 1967 - 1968 season would bring the program not only a new time slot , but also new storylines to spice up the ratings . In the fall of 1967 , CBS moved My Three Sons to Saturday night at 8 : 30 pm . In the season - premiere episode , `` Moving Day '' , the Douglas family and Uncle Charley relocate from the fictional town of Bryant Park in the Midwest to Los Angeles . Robbie ( Don Grady ) marries his classmate / girlfriend , Katie Miller ( Tina Cole ) . Tina Cole , in fact , had appeared in different roles on three previous episodes of My Three Sons : `` House For Sale '' from the fourth season ( February 13 , 1964 ) , `` The Coffee House Set '' from the fifth season ( November 19 , 1964 ) , and `` Robbie and the Little Stranger '' from the sixth season ( February 17 , 1966 ) . At the end of the 1967 - 1968 season , the ratings had improved from the previous year with the series placing at 24th in the Nielsens . The following season , the newlyweds discover that Katie is pregnant , and she gives birth to triplets named Robert , Steven , and Charles . Although originally played by sets of uncredited twins , these babies were played uncredited by Guy , Gunnar , and Garth Swanson . The most familiar triplets in the show 's last two seasons are played by Michael , Daniel , and Joseph Todd . </P> <P> The following year in the tenth season , 1969 - 1970 , Steve remarries , taking widowed teacher Barbara Harper ( Beverly Garland ) as his wife ; she brings with her a 5 - year - old daughter , Dorothy `` Dodie '' ( Dawn Lyn ) , so Steven now had a stepdaughter whom he also subsequently adopts . Also , the last year - and - a-half of the series feature fewer appearances of both Don Grady and Stanley Livingston . Grady 's character was written out of the show at the end of the 11th season , which allowed for his wife Katie and their triplet sons to remain within the Douglas household the following season ( as a structural engineer Robbie was working on a bridge construction in Peru ) . Chip and his teen wife Polly ( Ronne Troup ) ( who eloped after Polly 's disciplinarian father refused to sanction the marriage ) move into their own apartment . </P> <P> At the end of the 1970 - 1971 season ( the show 's 11th year ) , My Three Sons was still garnering healthy ratings . By the spring of 1971 , it had finished in 19th place . A 1971 television pilot with Don Grady and Tina Cole called Three of a Kind , then retitled Robbie -- about Robbie , Katie , and the triplets moving to San Francisco -- was filmed but not picked up as a series . </P> <P> The final episode of the 1970 - 1971 season , `` After the Honeymoon '' , actually set up the premise for this pilot . The guest stars were Richard X . Slattery and Pat Carroll , who were featured as the landlords of the apartment block into which Robbie and Katie move . However , Don Grady had informed the producers of his intention to leave the series and pursue a new full - time career as a composer , which he ultimately did . </P> <P> For the series ' 12th season , CBS moved My Three Sons to Monday nights at 10 : 00 pm . In addition to the time changes for the 12th season , a new four - part story arc is introduced with MacMurray in a second role , that of his cousin , the Laird ( Lord ) Fergus McBain Douglas of Sithian Bridge . The voice of English actor Alan Caillou is awkwardly dubbed over MacMurray 's . The plot centers around Lord Douglas 's arrival in Los Angeles from the family 's native Scotland , in search of a first lady to marry and return with him to Scotland . </P> <P> He finds Terri Dowling ( Anne Francis ) , a waitress at the Blue Berry Bowling Alley . While initially reluctant to give up her life in America and return to Scotland as royalty , she finally accepts . This storyline is a continuation of a plot idea that originally began in the fourth season , when the Douglases visit Scotland on the pretense of having been told they had inherited a castle in the highlands . </P> <P> With a later time slot , the show finished the season outside the top 30 . To save the series , CBS moved it in midseason back to Thursday nights at 8 : 30 pm , its old time slot . Nevertheless , My Three Sons ended its primetime run in the spring of 1972 after 12 years on the air . CBS also aired daytime reruns starting in September 1971 ( only the CBS color shows ) , for about one season . </P> <H2> Cast ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Main cast ( edit ) </H3> <Ul> <Li> Fred MacMurray , Steven `` Steve '' Douglas ( 1960 -- 1972 ) </Li> <Li> William Frawley , William Michael Francis Aloysius `` Bub '' O'Casey ( 1960 -- 1965 ) </Li> <Li> William Demarest , Charles Leslie `` Uncle Charley '' O'Casey , Bub 's brother ( 1965 -- 1972 ) </Li> <Li> Tim Considine , Michael `` Mike '' Douglas ( 1960 -- 1965 ) </Li> <Li> Don Grady , Robert `` Robbie '' Douglas ( 1960 -- 1971 ) </Li> <Li> Stanley Livingston , Richard `` Chip '' Douglas ( 1960 -- 1972 ) </Li> <Li> Barry Livingston , Ernest `` Ernie '' Thompson / Douglas ( 1963 -- 1972 ) </Li> <Li> Meredith MacRae , Sally Ann Morrison Douglas ( 1963 -- 1965 ) </Li> <Li> Tina Cole , Kathleen `` Katie '' Miller Douglas ( 1967 -- 1972 ) </Li> <Li> Beverly Garland , Barbara Harper Douglas ( 1969 -- 1972 ) </Li> <Li> Dawn Lyn , Dorothy `` Dodie '' Harper Douglas ( 1969 -- 1972 ) </Li> <Li> Ronne Troup , Polly Williams Douglas ( 1970 -- 1972 ) </Li> <Li> Michael , Daniel , and Joseph Todd , playing Robbie , Stevie , and Charley Douglas respectively ( 1970 -- 1972 ) </Li> </Ul> <H3> Recurring cast ( edit ) </H3> <Ul> <Li> Cynthia Pepper , Jean Pearson ( 1960 -- 1961 ) </Li> <Li> Peter Brooks , Hank Ferguson ( 1960 -- 1963 ) </Li> <Li> Cheryl Holdridge , Judy Doucette ( 1960 -- 1961 ) </Li> <Li> Ricky Allen , Hubert ' Sudsy ' Pfeiffer ( 1961 -- 1963 ) </Li> <Li> Hank Jones , Pete ( 1964 -- 1966 ) </Li> <Li> Bill Erwin , Joe Walters ( 1962 -- 1964 ) </Li> <Li> Doris Singleton , Helen Morrison ( 1964 -- 65 ) and Margaret Williams ( 1970 ) </Li> <Li> John Howard , Dave Welch ( 1965 -- 1967 ) </Li> <Li> Joan Tompkins , Lorraine Miller ( 1967 -- 1970 ) </Li> </Ul> <H3> Musical connections ( edit ) </H3> <P> The series ' cast had several music connections . MacMurray began his career as a saxophone player during the 1930s , and sometimes played it on the series , as well as clarinet . Actress Tina Cole ( Katie ) was born into the King Family , a popular 1950s -- 1960s group . Ronne Troup ( Polly ) was the step - daughter of singer Julie London and daughter of musician / composer Bobby Troup ( who wrote the song Route 66 and also starred in the TV program Emergency ! along with wife London ) , and Dawn Lyn is the younger sister of 1970s pop idol Leif Garrett . Don Grady ( Robbie ) composed and produced music , having created successful Las Vegas venues for Phantom of the Opera star Michael Crawford and pop star David Cassidy . </P> <P> Grady also played drums in the ' 60s pop group Yellow Balloon . Musical arranger Frank De Vol , who did the toe - tapping theme , scored over thirty motion pictures and arranged for such vocalists as Sarah Vaughan , Jack Jones , Nat King Cole , Ella Fitzgerald , Tony Bennett , Vic Damone , Dinah Shore , Doris Day , and Jaye P. Morgan . </P> <H2> Episodes ( edit ) </H2> <P> My Three Sons had 36 episodes each in the first two seasons . The series had more than thirty episodes in each of the first eight seasons ; the episode output then decreased by two episodes until the eleventh season , which had twenty - four episodes , along with the twelfth season . The first five seasons were filmed in black & white , then after the move to CBS , it was filmed in color for the remainder of its run . </P> <H2> Broadcast history ( edit ) </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Season </Th> <Th> Time slot ( ET ) </Th> <Th_colspan=\"2\"> Nielsen ratings </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Rank </Th> <Th> Rating </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1960 -- 61 </Td> <Td> Thursday at 9 : 00 - 9 : 30 PM on ABC </Td> <Td> 13 </Td> <Td> 25.8 ( Tied with 77 Sunset Strip ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1961 -- 62 </Td> <Td> 11 </Td> <Td> 24.7 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1962 -- 63 </Td> <Td> 28 </Td> <Td> 21.0 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1963 -- 64 </Td> <Td> Thursday at 8 : 30 - 9 : 00 PM on ABC </Td> <Td> 27 </Td> <Td> 21.9 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1964 -- 65 </Td> <Td> 13 </Td> <Td> 25.5 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1965 -- 66 </Td> <Td> Thursday at 8 : 30 - 9 : 00 PM on CBS </Td> <Td> 15 </Td> <Td> 23.8 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1966 -- 67 </Td> <Td> 29 </Td> <Td> 20.2 ( Tied with I Spy , CBS Thursday Night Movie and The REMOVED_SECRET. ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1967 -- 68 </Td> <Td> Saturday at 8 : 30 - 9 : 00 PM on CBS </Td> <Td> 24 </Td> <Td> 20.8 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1968 -- 69 </Td> <Td> 14 </Td> <Td> 22.8 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1969 -- 70 </Td> <Td> 15 </Td> <Td> 21.8 ( Tied with Ironside and The Johnny Cash Show ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1970 -- 71 </Td> <Td> 19 </Td> <Td> 20.8 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1971 -- 72 </Td> <Td> Monday at 9 : 00 - 9 : 30 PM on CBS ( Episodes 1 - 12 ) Thursday at 8 : 30 - 9 : 00 PM on CBS ( Episodes 13 - 24 ) Daytime Reruns : 10 : 30 - 11 : 00am ( EST ) M-F 12 / 20 / 71 - 6 / 23 / 72 4 : 00 - 4 : 30pm ( EST ) M-F 6 / 26 / 72 - 9 / 1 / 72 </Td> <Td> colspan = `` 2 '' data - sort - value = `` '' style = `` background : # ececec ; color : # 2C2C2C ; vertical - align : middle ; font - size : smaller ; text - align : center ; '' class = `` table - na '' N / A </Td> </Tr> </Table> <H2> Production schedule ( edit ) </H2> <P> The series was initially filmed at Desilu Studios in Hollywood , but at the start of the 1967 -- 68 season , the cast and crew began filming the series at the CBS Studio Center in Studio City , California . The reasons behind this move concerned the sale of actress - comedian Lucille Ball ' s studios to the Gulf + Western conglomerate , which owned Paramount Pictures , so Don Fedderson Productions , who produced My Three Sons ( along with Family Affair starring Brian Keith ) , had to quickly make other arrangements for filming . The move also necessitated moves in the show 's storyline as well , hence the family 's move from the fictitious town of Bryant Park ( in the Midwestern United States ) to North Hollywood , California , although the town is never officially mentioned , simply just the city of Los Angeles . </P> <P> Fred MacMurray was the only actor to appear in every episode of the series . Reportedly , MacMurray 's contract stipulated that he work only 65 days per year . His scenes for each season were produced in two blocks of filming . He would report to the Desilu - Gower lot in late May and work 35 days ( five days per week , weekends off ) , then take off for 10 weeks . He would then return to complete his remaining 30 days of shooting and was finished altogether around Thanksgiving . MacMurray 's ten - week hiatus in the middle of each season 's production schedule freed up the actor to follow other pursuits , while the filming of scenes with the other cast members continued . In short , all episodes were filmed out of sequence . Evidence of this is very apparent in several episodes , where plotlines had MacMurray 's character on a business trip ( e.g. `` Small Adventure '' ) or spending much of his time at the office ( e.g. `` Soap Box Derby '' ) . This allowed him to seemingly take part in the entire episode with limited or no interaction with the other regulars during filming . This sometimes produced noticeable continuity problems onscreen , especially as the boys grew and changed styles . </P> <H2> Distribution ( edit ) </H2> <P> Although Don Fedderson gets the credit , My Three Sons was created by George Tibbles and produced by Don Fedderson Productions throughout the show 's run , with MCA Television co-distributing the series during its 1960 -- 65 ABC airing . When the series moved to CBS in 1965 , the latter network assumed full production responsibilities ( in association with Fedderson Productions ) until the end of the series in 1972 . CBS now holds the series ' copyright . CBS Television Distribution presently owns distribution rights to the entire series ( including the more widely seen and aforementioned 1965 -- 72 CBS episodes ) . The show did not get syndicated until September 1976 ( although CBS did air reruns of the show in its daytime lineup from December 1971 until the fall of 1972 ) , and even then , only the CBS color episodes aired , while the black and white ABC episodes did not air on broadcast TV at all . </P> <P> Nick at Nite aired My Three Sons from November 3 , 1985 to October 28 , 1991 with episodes from Seasons 1 - 5 , the second half of season 11 , and season 12 . The Family Channel also aired only the black and white episodes from September 7 , 1992 to July 30 , 1993 . The Seasons 1 - 3 episodes had the original Chevrolet closing credits . The Seasons 6 -- 10 ( and the first half of season 11 ) episodes were later aired on TV Land in the late 1990s . Odyssey ran all of the color episodes in the early 2000s . They also briefly aired the black and white episodes . In 2000 , TV Land briefly aired the black & white episodes again , using the same syndication episode rights that were on Nick at Nite during the 1980s . In 2006 the Retro Television Network broadcast the show , airing only the color episodes . </P> <P> Since fall 2004 , only Seasons 6 - 10 are being distributed for syndication in the US - Domestic market , though very few stations air the show anymore . </P> <P> In 2009 , FamilyNet began airing the program as a lead - in for its Happy Days and Family Ties program block , which ended in February 2010 . From 2012 - 14 , and also from October 2015 - February 2016 , MeTV aired the Season 6 - 10 episodes in heavy rotation , and most closing credits included the original sponsor tags , such as those for Kellogg 's . In 2016 , Decades began airing the CBS ( color ) episodes in its `` binge '' blocks on some week - ends . </P> <P> MeTV began airing the black and white episodes on May 29 , 2017 . </P> <H2> Reunion special ( edit ) </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> This does not cite any sources .

( June 2017 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> MacMurray and most of the cast took part in Thanksgiving Reunion with The Partridge Family & My Three Sons , which aired on ABC on November 25 , 1977 . The retrospective special looked back at the history of My Three Sons and The Partridge Family ( other than featuring single parents with a large family , the two series had no narrative , or even a studio link ) . The special was notable for featuring footage from early black and white episodes of My Three Sons that , at this point in time , were not in syndication . While most of the collected casts gathered in a studio to reminisce , Demarest appeared in a brief pre-taped segment . </P> <H2> DVD releases ( edit ) </H2> <P> CBS DVD ( distributed by Paramount ) has released the first two seasons of My Three Sons on DVD in Region 1 . It is unknown if the remaining seasons will be released . </P> <P> In most episodes , the soundtrack was edited to remove the background musical score , which were originally stock music from the Capitol Records library ; the licensing agreement with Capitol only covered broadcast rights , not home video rights , and clearing the music for home video release with the individual composers who worked on the Capitol recordings was deemed cost - prohibitive . The Capitol scores were replaced instead with more modern , synthesized music . The original theme tune by Frank DeVol has been left unaltered ; his musical scores in later seasons of the show , written specifically for the series , would less - likely be affected by licensing problems if the later seasons were released on DVD . </P> <Table> <Tr> <Th> DVD name </Th> <Th> No. of episodes </Th> <Th> Release date </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> The First Season : Volume 1 </Td> <Td> 18 </Td> <Td> September 30 , 2008 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> The First Season : Volume 2 </Td> <Td> 18 </Td> <Td> January 20 , 2009 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> The Second Season : Volume 1 </Td> <Td> 18 </Td> <Td> February 23 , 2010 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> The Second Season : Volume 2 </Td> <Td> 18 </Td> <Td> June 15 , 2010 </Td> </Tr> </Table> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ Korkis , Jim . `` Fred MacMurray : The First Disney Legend by Wade Sampson '' .
