( December 2015 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> Marshall is still hungover after Punchy 's wedding , and makes a `` sweeping declaration '' that he will henceforth permanently stay sober . Future Ted says that Marshall 's `` sweeping declarations '' typically do n't work . Marshall receives a call from Garrison Cootes , a partner at one of the nation 's largest environmental law firms . He tells Marshall that the company is `` very interested '' in Marshall 's application for employment , and he will receive a job offer after the company completes an extensive background check . The danger of a background check concerns Marshall , who fears that a college - era video of him streaking through Wesleyan calling himself `` Beercules '' , which is now available online , could result in Garrison 's dropping the job offer . Marshall contacts the uploader , Pete Durkensen , an old college acquaintance , and asks him to remove the video . However , Marshall ends up getting drunk and streaking again , the effect of playing Edward Fortyhands with Pete , although Pete originally wanted to play Darts , and thus another `` Beercules '' video is uploaded . Pete 's refusal to take it down prompts Lily to blackmail him with information that she claims to have received from women who dated him in college . Eventually , Garrison does see the video , but offers Marshall a job anyway ; the video is not an issue with him . Later , Pete calls Marshall and offers to remove the video , but Marshall refuses . </P> <P> Thinking about a date with Nora , Barney appears to the gang in a leg cast and using crutches ; he hopes to use these to gain Nora 's sympathy . He meets Nora at a 24 - hour diner , where he is forced to explain to her all the plays he ever made on women , one of which irks a woman in an adjoining booth who overhears the conversation ; she turns out to be one of Barney 's previous conquests . Nora leaves , still angry at Barney for lying to her . To prove to Nora that he will never lie to her again , Barney vows not to leave the diner until she agrees to a second date . The gang eats at the diner nine hours later and sees Barney wake up . He refuses to make an order several times , and true to his word , does stay at the diner the whole time , which convinces Nora when she comes back . </P> <P> Ted capitalizes on being featured in New York magazine , speaking to women at newsstands when they pick up a copy of the magazine . He befriends 16 people , 13 of them being women , and dates two women from amongst them on separate occasions . With Lily 's and Robin 's help , he must decide on one of the women as a date to the exclusive `` Architect 's Ball '' . Robin thinks that the event will be boring , but hints that she would like to become Ted 's date when he mentions that Lenny Kravitz will be at the event , since she is an avid fan of the rock star . Ted winds up taking Robin to the gala , where she discovers that the Lenny Kravitz Ted was referring to is an old architect , Leonard Kravitz . Disappointed , Robin leaves the party . Future Ted tells his kids that a person will know for sure about falling in love `` pretty quickly and with absolute certainty . '' While looking at the gala guests , he sees his former girlfriend Victoria arranging cupcakes at a table and they establish eye contact . </P> <H2> Critical response ( edit ) </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> This section needs expansion .
