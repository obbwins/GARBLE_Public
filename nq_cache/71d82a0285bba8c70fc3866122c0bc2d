Before the family settled in their new house , they moved around frequently . The reader develops a sense of Esperanza 's observant and descriptive nature as she begins the novel with descriptions of minute behaviors and observations about her family members . Though Esperanza 's age is never revealed to the reader , it is implied that she is about thirteen . She begins to write as a way of expressing herself and as a way to escape the suffocating effect of the neighborhood . The novel also includes the stories of many of Esperanza 's neighbors , providing a picture of the neighborhood and offering examples of the many influences surrounding her . Esperanza quickly befriends Lucy and Rachel Guerrero , two Texan girls who live across the street . Lucy , Rachel , Esperanza , and Esperanza 's little sister , Nenny , have many adventures in the small space of their neighborhood . As the vignettes progress , the novel depicts Esperanza 's budding personal maturity and developing world outlook . </P> <P> Esperanza later slips into puberty and likes it when a boy watches her dance at a baptism party . Esperanza 's newfound views lead her to become friends with Sally , a girl her age who wears black nylon stockings , makeup , high heels , and short skirts , and uses boys as an escape from her abusive father . Sally , a beautiful girl according to her father , can get into trouble with being as beautiful as she is . Esperanza is not completely comfortable with Sally 's sexuality . Their friendship is compromised when Sally ditches Esperanza for a boy at a carnival . As a result , Esperanza is sexually assaulted by a man at the carnival . Earlier at her first job , an elderly man tricked her into kissing him on the lips . Esperanza 's traumatic experiences and observations of the women in her neighborhood cement her desire to escape Mango Street . She later realizes that she will never fully be able to leave Mango Street behind . She vows that after she leaves she will return to help the people she has left behind . Esperanza exclaims that Mango Street does not hold her in both arms ; instead , which sets her free . </P> <H2> Genre ( edit ) </H2> <P> The House on Mango Street is made up of vignettes that are not quite poems and not quite full stories . Not wanting to write directly about herself , Cisneros constructs the book in a combnation of genres pulling mantles of poetry , autobiography , and fiction . Certain parts of the book directly reflect Cisneros ' life , while others stray . Esperanza narrates these vignettes in first - person present tense , focusing on her day - to - day activities but sometimes narrating sections that are a series of observations . The vignettes can be as short as two or three paragraphs long and sometimes contain internal rhymes . In `` The Family of Little Feet '' for example , Esperanza says : </P> <P> `` Their arms were little , and their hands were little , and their height was not tall , and their feet very small . '' Each vignette can stand as an independent story . These vignettes do n't follow a complete or chronological narrative , although they often mention characters introduced in earlier sections . The conflicts and problems in these short stories are never fully resolved , just as the futures of people in the neighborhood are often uncertain . The overall tone of the novel is earnest and intimate , with very little distance between the reader and the narrator . The tone varies from pessimistic to hopeful , as Esperanza herself sometimes expresses her jaded views on life : </P> <P> `` I knew then I had to have a house . A real house . One I could point to . But this is n't it . The house on Mango Street is n't it . For the time being , Mama says . Temporary , says Papa . But I know how those things go . '' </P> <P> The set of vignettes charts her life as Esperanza Cordero grows during the year : both physically and emotionally . </P> <P> Cisneros asserts that the goal of The House on Mango Street was to make the novel accessible to everyone . She wrote the book initially as a catharsis , not realizing that it would eventually represent a voice for Latinos and become enveloped in the works of great Latino literature . She wanted it to be lyrical enough to be appreciated by poetry enthusiasts , but also accessible enough that laymen could read and enjoy the novel . She desired the book to resonate with children , adults , and ages in between , and in totality chose to keep the novel short so that even the busiest of parents and adults who worked long shifts like her father always had , could still find time to read it . </P> <H2> Autobiographical elements ( edit ) </H2> <P> Sandra Cisneros ' early life was a subject she would later draw on as a writer in books like The House on Mango Street . She was the only daughter among seven children in her family . Cisneros ' family and father specifically did not initially support her writing . Her father never wanted her to be an author . When she was growing up , the only famous Latinas were those on TV , and in the seventies they were seen most often on television as weather girls . Cisneros and her father envisioned her as a newscaster for that reason . Despite a lacking support system , Cisneros continued to pursue writing , and used her life to inspire her early works . The House on Mango Street includes information inspired by her life . The story also is about the subject of migration , and about the struggles of her life during it , which included poverty , as well as misogyny . Cisneros first began writing about the protagonist , Esperanza , when she had just finished graduate school . Cisneros created Esperanza from personal feelings of displacement she had while writing . She had recently graduated from the University of Iowa and had felt marginalized as a person of color , a woman , and an individual of lower socioeconomic status . The House on Mango Street became a way for her to solidify her identities through reflection in writing . Esperanza is one of four children , with a younger sister and two younger brothers . In reality , Cisneros was the middle child and only girl with six brothers , two older and four younger . While writing , Cisneros explains that because she was new to fiction , she initially craved simplicity , which resulted in Esperanza 's family being smaller than her actual family had been . She believed it would be easier to write about fewer family members . </P> <H2> Critical reception ( edit ) </H2> <P> Acclaimed by critics , The House on Mango Street has been translated into various languages and has been taught in schools across the United States and Canada . The book received highly positive reception upon release and has been re-issued in a 25th Anniversary Edition . The novel has especially earned high praise from the Latino / Latina community . Oscar Hijuelos , the first Hispanic writer to win a Pulitzer Prize for Fiction , said that the novel has `` conveyed the Southwestern Latino experience with verve , charm , and passion . '' The book won her the American Book Award from the Before Columbus Foundation ( 1985 ) . </P> <P> After the initial release , the response to The House on Mango Street by the public and various academics was varied . Much of the critical reception surrounding the novel stems from the sexual content present throughout multiple scenes . During the `` Red Clowns '' chapter of the novel , Esperanza is raped by a male who repeatedly defines her as a `` Spanish girl '' whom he loves . Critics argued that the suspected audience of the book was perceived to be too young for this content . </P> Protesters are seen in June 2011 in support of the Tucson Unified School District 's Mexican - American studies program . A new state law effectively ended the program saying it was divisive . <P> Despite its high praise in the realm of Latino literature , The House on Mango Street has also received criticism and has been banned from some school curriculums . </P> <P> In response to these criticisms as well as the removal of the MAS program from TUSD schools , teachers , authors , and activists headed by Tony Diaz , a teacher from the MAS program formed a caravan in spring of 2012 that moved across the southwest conducting workshops in major cities . The caravan , called the Librotraficante Project , originated at the Alamo and ended in Tucson orchestrating workshops distributing books that had been removed with the curriculum , and informing attendees of H.B. 2281 . Though The House on Mango Street was never removed from TUSD 's curriculum and continued to be taught in middle and high school English classes within TUSD , Cisneros traveled with the caravan reading The House on Mango Street and ran workshops about Chicano literature . She brought numerous copies of the book with her , distributed them , and discussed thematic implications of her novel as well as talked about the book 's autobiographical elements . </P> <P> Parents and education boards in other areas have found the content to be too graphic / real for children of a young age . In response to this categorization as a children 's novel , Cisernos replies that even though it 's marketed as a young people 's book , the range of readers stems all the way to college level students . Cisernos ' novel has one general theme : to promote individuality and drive within individuals which will conversely promote a distaste for conformity and cultural labeling . Much of the critical reception surrounding the book today recants this theme due to its suspected negative effects on individuals challenging superior powers such as the government and educational institutions . </P> <H2> Publication history ( edit ) </H2> <P> 1984 , The United States , Arte P\u00fablico Press ISBN 0 - 934770 - 20 - 4 , Pub date 1 January 1984 , paperback </P> <P> 1991 , The United States , Vintage Contemporaries ISBN 0 - 679 - 73477 - 5 , Pub date 3 April 1991 , paperback </P> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Chicago literature </Li> <Li> Chicano literature </Li> </Ul> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> ^ Jump up to : Cisneros , Sandra ( 1991 ) .
