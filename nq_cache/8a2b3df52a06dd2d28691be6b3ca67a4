Another doctor is first on the scene and begins applying pressure to the child 's neck . Shaun tells him that he 's pressing on the wrong part of the neck for a child . With his unique ability to visualize the internal body and using improvised methods and tools , Shaun is able to stabilize the boy . On the way to the hospital , Shaun notices that the boy 's vitals have changed . Hospital staff are alerted to the arrival of the boy . Shaun tries to tell the doctors about the boy 's vitals , stating that he needs an echo - cardiogram . The doctors disagree and begin surgery . While operating , something goes wrong and Claire Browne , a surgical resident , recalls Shaun mentioning an echo . Thanks to Shaun 's diagnosis , the boy 's life is saved . Meanwhile , in a hospital board meeting , Dr. Aaron Glassman , president of the hospital , tries to convince the board to hire Shaun , despite his autism .

Dr. Melendez is doing rounds with Dr. Claire Brown and Dr. Jared Kalu . Melendez calls out Shaun for arriving late . Rounds are interrupted when a nurse tells them a consult is needed in the emergency room . A middle aged woman , Stephanie , has been brought in with abdominal pain . Looking at the scan , Shaun says she has a Sarcoma - a malignant tumor . Dr. Melendez assigns Claire as his number two for the surgery while giving Shaun `` scut work '' - all the work that residents hate doing . On the operating table , the doctors find the tumor is much bigger than expected and has encased all of her arteries . Looking at biopsy results , the residents find out that she is suffering from Leiomyosarcoma , making surgery seemingly impossible . Shaun `` s ability to visualize the internal organs allows him to figure out that removing one of her kidneys would allow a better look , enough to view and possibly remove the mass . To Claire 's dismay , Dr. Kalu suggests Shaun 's idea to his attending ; getting the credit for the idea . Meanwhile , Shuan 's attention to detail in his `` scut '' work gets him into trouble . Instead of releasing patients ready for discharge , Shaun rechecks them , and orders additional tests . Upon learning this , Melendez assigns Nurse Freydey as Shaun 's `` boss '' for the day . Later , in looking at a young girls test results ( she was sent home ) , Shaun realizes what 's really wrong and races to her home . The parents are angry that he 's bothering them after midnight and at first refuse to let him in . Shaun insists he will not leave before seeing their daughter . His diagnosis is correct , and they must rush her to the hospital for surgery to save her life . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> </Th> <Td> `` Oliver '' </Td> <Td> John Dahl </Td> <Td> Bill Rotko </Td> <Td> October 9 , 2017 ( 2017 - 10 - 09 ) </Td> <Td> 10.69 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan=\"6\"> Shaun and Claire fly to San Francisco Municipal Hospital to get a patient a liver . They ca n't fly on their way back due to fog and are forced to use a police escort . Problems keep coming one after the other ; first , the liver 's temperature went above the required maximum , forcing them to have a sudden stop at a local store , where they cool it by submerging it in slush . As they proceed with their journey , Shaun discovers that the liver has a clot . With only two hours of viability left , the duo decide to perform an operation on the way in order to remove the clot and flash the left lobe , to protect it from the ice bath . Back at San Jose St. Bonaventure Hospital , Chuck , the recipient of the liver , is discovered to have alcohol in his system ; a likelihood that he might be moved to the bottom of the list . Chuck later confesses that he actually took a drink on his daughter 's graduation . In order to protect its reputation and the future patients , the hospital decides to move Chuck to the bottom of the list . To their dismay , Shaun and Claire arrive back , only to find out that the liver has to be taken to another patient in another hospital . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> </Th> <Td> `` Pipes '' </Td> <Td> Steven DePaul </Td> <Td> Thomas L.

Dr. Melendez suggests termination of the pregnancy but Shaun interjects by suggesting clotting pre-operatively with an infusion of unfractionated heparin . Things are further complicated when the woman and eventually her husband refuse to terminate the baby . During surgery , there is a complication ; a blood clot at the artery in her heart . Dr. Kalu has an idea that they should stop her heart and put her on a bypass machine for the duration of the surgery ; that way she wo n't have an heart attack , which turns out to be successful and the doctors reveal she 's carrying a baby boy . With a patient needing a boil lanced , Dr. Melendez assigns Shaun and Dr. Browne on the case , as a punishment for being late . The patient turns out to be a pornographic actress ; she does n't have a boil but a large Bartholin gland abscess and they prep her for surgery the following day . They successfully drain the abscess but discover that she has a Perineal myoma underneath . The fabroid tumor is wrapped around the nerve that facilitates feeling in her genitals . Therefore , the doctors have to remove the tumor but they have to sever the nerve ; hence , losing all feeling in her genitals . Shaun comes up the idea of grafting the distal end of the pudendal nerve to the branch of the femoral cutaneous nerve from her inner thigh ; this will lead to her losing feeling in her thigh while preserving feeling in her genitals . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> 5 </Th> <Td> `` Point Three Percent '' </Td> <Td> Larry Teng </Td> <Td> David Hoselton </Td> <Td> October 23 , 2017 ( 2017 - 10 - 23 ) </Td> <Td> 10.39 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan=\"6\"> Shaun notices a young boy with an indubitable resemblance to his deceased brother Steve , forming a bond with him . The boy 's name is actually Evan and was brought to the hospital by his parents for reportedly breaking an arm ; unbeknownst to Evan , he is in fact suffering from stage 4 Osteosarcoma . Shaun later suspects that he might have been misdiagnosed with cancer but indeed was suffering from Langerhans cell histiocytosis . In order not to give both Evan and his parents false hopes , Shaun decides to lie , attempting to perform a bone marrow aspiration , but he is caught red - handed by the parents . Subsequently , Evan starts coughing out blood , sending him to the OR . While on the operating table , Dr. Neil Menendez and Dr. Claire Browne discover that the cancer had metastasized , undoubtable proof that he is indeed suffering with terminal cancer . The other doctors are trying to find a prognosis of a 55 - year old man , brought to the hospital by his estranged son , with an allergy causing him to have convulsions . Dr. Browne later finds out that the man is suffering from Echinococcus , a cyst form of tapeworms . Saddened by Evan 's fate , which Evan has in fact known about the whole time , Shaun reads Evan the final few pages of To Kill a Mockingbird , a book of Steve 's that he never finished reading before he died . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> 6 </Th> <Td> `` Not Fake '' </Td> <Td> Michael Patrick Jann </Td> <Td> Simran Baidwan </Td> <Td> October 30 , 2017 ( 2017 - 10 - 30 ) </Td> <Td> 10.60 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan=\"6\"> Shaun and the rest of the residents are working the graveyard shift when numerous casualties from a wedding bus crash come in .

However , he questioned `` how long can audiences be entranced by both the brilliance of ( Highmore 's ) character 's savant skills and the difficulties that come from his autism in the workplace . '' Daniel Fienberg of The Hollywood Reporter felt the trailer was `` both kinda progressive and really dated '' . He added , `` Too much felt on - the - nose -- especially Hill Harper as the main character 's detractor and Richard Schiff as his noble defender '' , while also commentating that `` On - the - nose / premise is how you have to trailer a show like this , and maybe spaced out over 43 minutes it wo n't grate .

The website 's consensus reads , `` The Good Doctor 's heavy - handed bedside manner undermines a solid lead performance , but under all the emotionally manipulative gimmickry , there 's still plenty of room to improve . '' Metacritic , which uses a weighted average , assigned a score of 53 out of 100 based on 15 critics , indicating `` mixed or average reviews '' . </P> <P> Giving his first impression of the series ' pilot for TVLine , Matt Webb Mitovich stated , `` The Good Doctor boasts great DNA ... ( and ) has the potential to be a refreshingly thought - provoking hospital drama , based on the buttons pushed in the pilot alone . '' He enjoyed the `` warm dynamic '' of Schiff and Highmore , while describing Thomas ' character as `` our emotional ' in ' to Shaun 's distinct , distant world '' . He noted that `` it takes a while to build up momentum '' , but concluded that `` the very final scene packs quite a punch , as Dr. Murphy unwittingly puts a colleague on notice '' . </P> <P> The New York Times television critic , James Poniewozik notes in his Critic 's Notebook column , that for the most part the drama is a `` hospital melodrama with whiz - bang medical science , a dash of intra-staff romance and shameless sentimentality . '' Discussing the main characters of Dr. Aaron Glassman ( Richard Schiff ) and Dr. Shaun Murphy ( Freddie Highmore ) , however , Poniewozik writes that `` Mr. Schiff is convincing in the role and Mr. Highmore is striking in his . '' </P> <P> Speaking of Freddie Highmore 's Golden Globe nomination on Monday , December 11 , 2017 , for his role in The Good Doctor , Laura Bradley , writing for Vanity Fair ( magazine ) says : `` ... Freddie Highmore received the awards recognition that has long and unjustly eluded him ... '' Bradley feels that Highmore 's perfomance has been `` the central key '' to the show 's enormous success and while the show had lukewarm reviews , most critics have praised Highmore 's work . </P> <H3> Accolades ( edit ) </H3> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Year </Th> <Th> Award </Th> <Th> </Th> <Th> Nominee ( s ) </Th> <Th> Result </Th> <Th> Ref . </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 2018 </Td> <Td> Golden Globe Awards </Td> <Td> Best Actor -- Television Series Drama </Td> <Td> Freddie Highmore </Td> <Td> Pending </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> </Table> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ http://REMOVED_SECRET/2017/11/03/how-san-jose-in-the-good-doctor-compares-to-the-real-thing/ </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Koblin , John ( November 19 , 2017 ) . `` How ABC Found a surprise Hit in `` The Good Doctor '' `` .
