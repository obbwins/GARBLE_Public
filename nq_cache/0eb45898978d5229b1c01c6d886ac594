She undergoes a debriefing about a four month expedition into an anomalous iridescent electromagnetic field called `` the Shimmer '' from which she and her husband Kane are the only survivors . </P> <P> In flashback , Lena 's husband , an Army Special Forces soldier , appears in their home after having gone missing on a mission nearly a year ago . He remembers nothing of that time and suddenly becomes very ill . A government security force intercepts Kane 's ambulance and transports him and Lena to Area X , near where the Shimmer had begun to spread three years earlier . A psychologist , Dr. Ventress , explains that military teams , including Kane 's , have ventured into the Shimmer to attempt to reach the lighthouse where the phenomenon first appeared . Kane is the only person to have ever returned from an expedition . Lena volunteers to join Ventress on a research expedition consisting of two scientists , Josie and Cassie , and a paramedic , Anya . </P> <P> Guidance technology fails , the expedition members realize they are unable to remember extended stretches of time , and a mutated alligator attacks Josie . The team rescues her and learns that the alligator shows signs of being hybridized with a shark . At an abandoned military base , the team discovers evidence of Kane 's expedition along with a memory card left for them . A video on it shows Kane cutting open the stomach of a fellow expedition member while he was still alive , revealing that his intestines have begun to wriggle in a worm - like manner . That night , the base 's perimeter fence is torn open , prompting everyone to investigate . Suddenly , a mutated bear drags Cassie away ; the following morning , the team finds one of her boots . Lena searches further , alone , and she discovers Cassie 's mutilated corpse . Lena returns to the team and reports that Cassie has died . </P> <P> As the team continues toward the lighthouse at the center of the Shimmer , they find a decayed settlement with human - shaped plants outside it . Josie says she thinks the Shimmer is acting on organisms in the manner of a prism , distorting and refracting DNA in the same way that a prism refracts light . The expedition members realize they are slowly changing as well . That night , Anya descends into a psychotic state , attacking and restraining the other team members . As she is threatening them , Anya hears what sounds like Cassie crying for help outside and investigates . The bear that killed Cassie enters the house , its roar imitating Cassie 's dying screams . It kills Anya and attacks Lena before Josie can shoot it dead . </P> <P> Ventress leaves Lena and Josie to complete the journey while she still can . Josie muses that she does n't want to go on and begins to grow flowers from her body . She walks away from Lena and disappears among the human - shaped plants . Lena reaches the lighthouse and goes inside , finding an incinerated corpse , a video - camera and a hole in the floor . Footage on the camera shows Kane ranting about the Shimmer 's effects on him . He urges the cameraman to find Lena , then commits suicide with a white - phosphorus grenade , after which a doppelg\u00e4nger of his walks into view . </P> <P> Lena descends into the hole in the floor and finds Ventress , who has also begun to mutate . Ventress tells Lena the forces at work will eventually encompass `` everything '' , before disintegrating into a fiery nebulous structure that absorbs a drop of blood from Lena 's face and creates a humanoid being . Lena attacks it , and attempts to escape the lighthouse but the being stops her , mirroring her movements and knocking her out . The struggle resumes when Lena awakens , the being gradually transforming into an identical copy of her . Lena exploits its behavior to place a phosphorus grenade in its hands and activates it before fleeing . The being is set ablaze , flames engulf the lighthouse , the various constructs in the area collapse , and the Shimmer dissipates to nothing . </P> <P> Lena 's debriefing concludes , and she reunites with Kane , who has recovered rapidly with the Shimmer having ceased to exist . She asks him if he is the `` real '' Kane , to which he replies , `` I do n't think so . '' He asks her if she is Lena , but she does not answer him . The two embrace , and their irises shimmer and change color . </P> <H2> Cast ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Natalie Portman as Lena <Ul> <Li> Kristen McGarrity as Lena 's double </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> Jennifer Jason Leigh as Dr. Ventress </Li> <Li> Gina Rodriguez as Anya Thorensen </Li> <Li> Tessa Thompson as Josie Radek </Li> <Li> Tuva Novotny as Cassie `` Cass '' Sheppard </Li> <Li> Oscar Isaac as Kane </Li> <Li> Benedict Wong as Lomax </Li> <Li> Sonoya Mizuno as Katie <Ul> <Li> Mizuno also portrays a humanoid </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> David Gyasi as Daniel </Li> <Li> Sammy Hayman as Mayer </Li> <Li> Josh Danford as Shelley </Li> <Li> John Schwab as Paramedic </Li> </Ul> <H2> Production ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Development ( edit ) </H3> <P> In March 2013 , it was announced that Paramount Pictures and Scott Rudin Productions had acquired the film rights to Annihilation , the first novel in Jeff VanderMeer 's Southern Reach Trilogy , and that the film would be produced by Scott Rudin and Eli Bush . Alex Garland was hired to adapt and direct the film the next year . Garland revealed to Creative Screenwriting that his adaptation was necessarily based on only the first novel in the trilogy : </P> <P> At the point I started working on Annihilation , there was only one of the three books . I knew that it was planned as a trilogy by the author , but there was only the manuscript for the first book . I really did n't think too much about the trilogy side of it . </P> <P> Garland 's film is `` an adaptation which was a memory of the book '' , rather than book - referenced screenwriting , with the intention of capturing the `` dreamlike nature '' and tone of his experience reading VanderMeer 's novel . Rather than trying to directly adapt the book Garland deliberately took the story in his own direction , with VanderMeer 's permission . Garland did not read the other two books when they arrived , as he was concerned he would need to revise his script . Others informed him of the elements of the books , and he expressed surprise at some of the correlations . </P> <P> Prior to its release , the film drew criticism for the casting of Natalie Portman and Jennifer Jason Leigh as characters who are , in the later books , described as Asian and of half Native American descent , respectively . Garland stated that none of the five female characters ' ethnicity is mentioned in the first book , which was the only one of the trilogy he had read , and that the script was complete before the second book was published . He cast the characters based on his reaction only to the actors he had met in the casting process , or actors he had worked with before . </P> <H3> Filming ( edit ) </H3> <P> Principal photography was underway by April 2016 , when actor David Gyasi was added to the cast . Location filming by Lighthouse Pictures Ltd occurred starting in late April in South Forest , Windsor Great Park . Some test shooting had already been done in St. Marks , Florida , but the vegetation in the area turned out to be too dense to give any depth perception on screen . On May 9 , 2016 , cinematographer Rob Hardy began sharing pictures from the set of the film . On July 13 and 14 , filming took place at Holkham Pines in North Norfolk . Shooting was completed that month . </P> <P> The visual effect team was made up of many of Garland 's collaborators from his previous film , Ex Machina , including VFX Supervisor Andrew Whitehurst , lead VFX house Double Negative and Milk VFX , plus special makeup effects by Tristan Versluis . </P> <H2> Release ( edit ) </H2> <P> The film was released theatrically in the United States on February 23 , 2018 , by Paramount Pictures , and digitally in other markets on March 12 , 2018 , by Netflix . </P> <P> Due to a poorly received test screening , David Ellison , a financier and producer at Paramount , became concerned that the film was `` too intellectual '' and `` too complicated '' , and demanded changes to make it appeal to a wider audience , including making Portman 's character more sympathetic , and changing the ending . Producer Scott Rudin sided with the director , who did not want to alter the film . Rudin , who had final cut privilege , defended the film and refused to take notes from Ellison . </P> <P> On December 7 , 2017 , it was announced that due to the clashes between Rudin and Ellison , and the shift in Paramount 's leadership , a deal was struck allowing Netflix to distribute the film internationally . According to this deal , Paramount will handle the American , Canadian and Chinese release , while Netflix will begin streaming the film in other territories 17 days later . </P> <P> Garland expressed his disappointment with the decision to allow digital distribution , by saying : </P> <P> We made the film for cinema . I 've got no problem with the small screen at all . The best genre piece I 've seen in a long time was The Handmaid 's Tale , so I think there 's incredible potential within that context , but if you 're doing that -- you make it for that ( exhibition format ) and you think of it in those terms . Look ... it is what it is . The film is getting a theatrical release in the States , which I 'm really pleased about . One of the big pluses of Netflix is that it goes out to a lot of people and you do n't have that strange opening weekend thing where you 're wondering if anyone is going to turn up and then if they do n't , it vanishes from cinema screens in two weeks . So it 's got pluses and minuses , but from my point of view and the collective of the people who made it -- ( it was made ) to be seen on a big screen . </P> <H3> Home Media ( edit ) </H3> <P> Annihilation was released on Digital HD on May 22 , 2018 , and on Ultra HD Blu - ray , Blu - ray and DVD on May 29 , 2018 . </P> <H2> Reception ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Box Office ( edit ) </H3> <P> As of May 12 , 2018 , Annihilation has grossed $32.7 million in the United States and Canada and $10.3 million in China , for a worldwide total of $43 million , against a net production budget of $40 million . </P> <P> In North America , Annihilation was released in alongside Game Night and Every Day , and was projected to gross $10 -- 12 million from 2,012 theaters in its opening weekend . The film made $3.9 million on its first day ( including $900,000 from Thursday night previews at 1,850 theaters ) . It ended up making $11 million over the weekend , finishing fourth , behind Black Panther , Game Night , and Peter Rabbit . In its second weekend the film dropped 49 % to $5.9 million , falling to 6th place . </P> <H3> Critical response ( edit ) </H3> <P> On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes , the film has an approval rating of 87 % , based on 237 reviews , and an average rating of 7.7 / 10 . The website 's critical consensus reads , `` Annihilation backs up its sci - fi visual wonders and visceral genre thrills with an impressively ambitious -- and surprisingly strange -- exploration of challenging themes that should leave audiences pondering long after the end credits roll . '' On Metacritic , the film has a weighted average score of 79 out of 100 , based on reviews from 49 critics , indicating `` generally favorable reviews '' . Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of `` C '' on an A+ to F scale , while PostTrak reported filmgoers gave it a 71 % overall positive score . </P> <P> Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun - Times gave the film 4 out of 4 stars , praising it for taking risks , and saying : `` Kudos to Garland and the cast , but bravo to Scott Rudin as well . Apparently you knew a masterpiece when you saw it , and you made sure we were able to see it as well . '' Writing for Rolling Stone , Peter Travers complimented the cast and Garland 's writing and direction , giving the film 3.5 stars out of 4 and saying , `` Garland need make no apologies for Annihilation . It 's a bracing brainteaser with the courage of its own ambiguity . You work out the answers in your own head , in your own time , in your own dreams , where the best sci - fi puzzles leave things . '' Conversely , The Economist described the film as `` tightrope - walking the fine line between open - ended , mind - expanding mystery and lethargic , pretentious twaddle '' , but praised its final half hour . </P> <P> Nerdist Industries ' Kyle Anderson called Annihilation `` a movie that deserves several viewings , and your brain 's whole attention '' . Anderson commented that the film has little to do with the novel that it was based on , and is similar to H.P. Lovecraft 's 1927 short story `` The Colour Out of Space '' , about a meteor that lands in a swamp and unleashes a plague . Chris McCoy of the Memphis Flyer also found the film reminiscent of `` The Colour Out of Space '' as well as the novel Roadside Picnic ( 1971 ) and its film adaptation , Stalker ( 1979 ) . </P> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ `` ANNIHILATION ( 15 ) '' .
