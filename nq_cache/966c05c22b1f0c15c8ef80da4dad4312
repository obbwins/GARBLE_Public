{"document_text": "Onomatopoeia - wikipedia <H1> Onomatopoeia </H1> This article is about the category of words . For the comic character , see Onomatopoeia ( comics ) . <P> </P> A sign in a shop window in Italy proclaims `` No Tic Tac '' , in imitation of the sound of a clock . <P> Onomatopoeia ( / \u02cc\u0252n\u0259\u02ccm\u00e6t\u0259\u02c8pi\u02d0\u0259 , - \u02ccm\u0251\u02d0 - / ( listen ) ; from the Greek \u1f40\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u03af\u03b1 ; \u1f44\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1 for `` name '' and \u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u03ad\u03c9 for `` I make '' , adjectival form : `` onomatopoeic '' or `` onomatopoetic '' ) is the process of creating a word that phonetically imitates , resembles , or suggests the sound that it describes . As such words are uncountable nouns , onomatopoeia refers to the property of such words . Common occurrences of words our of the onomatopoeia process include animal noises such as `` oink '' , `` miaow '' ( or `` meow '' ) , `` roar '' and `` chirp '' . Onomatopoeia can differ between languages : it conforms to some extent to the broader linguistic system ; hence the sound of a clock may be expressed as tick tock in English , tictac in Spanish , d\u012b d\u0101 in Mandarin , katchin katchin in Japanese , or `` tik - tik '' in Hindi . </P> <P> Although in the English language the term onomatopoeia means `` the imitation of a sound '' , the compound word onomatopoeia ( \u1f40\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u03af\u03b1 ) in the Greek language means `` making or creating names '' . For words that imitate sounds , the term \u1f74\u03c7\u03bf\u03bc\u03b9\u03bc\u03b7\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc ( echomimetico ) or echomimetic ) is used . The word \u1f74\u03c7\u03bf\u03bc\u03b9\u03bc\u03b7\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc ( echomimetico ) derives from `` \u1f74\u03c7\u03ce '' , meaning echo or sound , and `` \u03bc\u03b9\u03bc\u03b7\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc '' , meaning mimetic or imitating . </P> <H2> Contents </H2> <Ul> <Li> 1 Uses <Ul> <Li> 1.1 Cross-cultural differences </Li> <Li> 1.2 Onomatopoeic effect without onomatopoeic words </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 Comics and advertising <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Manner imitation </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Examples in media </Li> <Li> 4 Cross-linguistic examples </Li> <Li> 5 In linguistics </Li> <Li> 6 The evolution of language </Li> <Li> 7 Role in early language acquisition </Li> <Li> 8 In other languages <Ul> <Li> 8.1 Japanese </Li> <Li> 8.2 Malay </Li> <Li> 8.3 Arabic </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 9 See also </Li> <Li> 10 References <Ul> <Li> 10.1 Notes </Li> <Li> 10.2 General references </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 11 External links </Li> </Ul> <H2> Uses </H2> A bang flag gun , a humouristic novelty item Further information : List of animal sounds <P> In the case of a frog croaking , the spelling may vary because different frog species around the world make different sounds : Ancient Greek brekekekex koax koax ( only in Aristophanes ' comic play The Frogs ) probably for marsh frogs ; English ribbit for species of frog found in North America ; English verb croak for the common frog . </P> <P> Some other very common English - language examples are hiccup , zoom , bang , beep , moo , and splash . Machines and their sounds are also often described with onomatopoeia : honk or beep - beep for the horn of an automobile , and vroom or brum for the engine . In speaking of a mishap involving an audible arcing of electricity , the word `` zap '' is often used ( and its use has been extended to describe non-auditory effects generally connoting the same sort of localized but thorough interference or destruction similar to that produced in short - circuit sparking ) . </P> <P> Human sounds sometimes provide instances of onomatopoeia , as when mwah is used to represent a kiss . </P> <P> For animal sounds , words like quack ( duck ) , moo ( cow ) , bark or woof ( dog ) , roar ( lion ) , meow / miaow or purr ( cat ) , cluck ( chicken ) and baa ( sheep ) are typically used in English ( both as nouns and as verbs ) . </P> <P> Some languages flexibly integrate onomatopoeic words into their structure . This may evolve into a new word , up to the point that the process is no longer recognized as onomatopoeia . One example is the English word `` bleat '' for sheep noise : in medieval times it was pronounced approximately as `` blairt '' ( but without an R - component ) , or `` blet '' with the vowel drawled , which more closely resembles a sheep noise than the modern pronunciation . </P> <P> An example of the opposite case is `` cuckoo '' , which , due to continuous familiarity with the bird noise down the centuries , has kept approximately the same pronunciation as in Anglo - Saxon times and its vowels have not changed as they have in the word furrow . </P> <P> Verba dicendi ( `` words of saying '' ) are a method of integrating onomatopoeic words and ideophones into grammar . </P> <P> Sometimes , things are named from the sounds they make . In English , for example , there is the universal fastener which is named for the sound it makes : the zip ( in the UK ) or zipper ( in the U.S. ) Many birds are named after their calls , such as the bobwhite quail , the weero , the morepork , the killdeer , chickadees and jays , the cuckoo , the chiffchaff , the whooping crane , the whip - poor - will , and the kookaburra . In Tamil and Malayalam , the word for crow is kaakaa . This practice is especially common in certain languages such as M\u0101ori , and so in names of animals borrowed from these languages . </P> <H3> Cross-cultural differences </H3> <P> Although a particular sound is heard similarly by people of different cultures , it is often expressed through the use of different consonant strings in different languages . For example , the snip of a pair of scissors is cri - cri in Italian , riqui - riqui in Spanish , terre - terre or treque - treque in Portuguese , krits - krits in modern Greek and katr - katr in Hindi . Similarly , the `` honk '' of a car 's horn is ba - ba ( Han : \u53ed \u53ed ) in Mandarin , tut - tut in French , pu - pu in Japanese , bbang - bbang in Korean , b\u00e6rt - b\u00e6rt in Norwegian , fom - fom in Portuguese and bim - bim in Vietnamese . </P> <H3> Onomatopoeic effect without onomatopoeic words </H3> <P> An onomatopoeic effect can also be produced in a phrase or word string with the help of alliteration and consonance alone , without using any onomatopoeic words . The most famous example is the phrase `` furrow followed free '' in Samuel Taylor Coleridge 's The Rime of the Ancient Mariner . The words `` followed '' and `` free '' are not onomatopoeic in themselves , but in conjunction with `` furrow '' they reproduce the sound of ripples following in the wake of a speeding ship . Similarly , alliteration has been used in the line `` as the surf surged up the sun swept shore ... '' , to recreate the sound of breaking waves , in the poem `` I , She and the Sea '' . </P> <H2> Comics and advertising </H2> A sound effect of breaking a door <P> Comic strips and comic books make extensive use of onomatopoeia . Popular culture historian Tim DeForest noted the impact of writer - artist Roy Crane ( 1901 -- 1977 ) , the creator of Captain Easy and Buz Sawyer : </P> <Dl> <Dd> It was Crane who pioneered the use of onomatopoeic sound effects in comics , adding `` bam , '' `` pow '' and `` wham '' to what had previously been an almost entirely visual vocabulary . Crane had fun with this , tossing in an occasional `` ker - splash '' or `` lickety - wop '' along with what would become the more standard effects . Words as well as images became vehicles for carrying along his increasingly fast - paced storylines . </Dd> </Dl> <P> In 2002 , DC Comics introduced a villain named Onomatopoeia , an athlete , martial artist , and weapons expert , who often speaks pure sounds . </P> <P> Advertising uses onomatopoeia for mnemonic purposes , so that consumers will remember their products , as in Alka - Seltzer 's `` Plop , plop , fizz , fizz . Oh , what a relief it is ! '' jingle , recorded in two different versions ( big band and rock ) by Sammy Davis , Jr . </P> <P> Rice Krispies ( US and UK ) and Rice Bubbles ( AU ) make a `` snap , crackle , pop '' when one pours on milk . During the 1930s , the illustrator Vernon Grant developed Snap , Crackle and Pop as gnome - like mascots for the Kellogg Company . </P> <P> Sounds appear in road safety advertisements : `` clunk click , every trip '' ( click the seatbelt on after clunking the car door closed ; UK campaign ) or `` click , clack , front and back '' ( click , clack of connecting the seat belts ; AU campaign ) or `` click it or ticket '' ( click of the connecting seat belt , with the implied penalty of a traffic ticket for not using a seat belt ; US DOT ( Department of Transportation ) campaign ) . </P> <P> The sound of the container opening and closing gives Tic Tac its name . </P> <H3> Manner imitation </H3> Main article : Ideophone <P> In many of the world 's languages , onomatopoeic - like words are used to describe phenomena beyond the purely auditive . Japanese often uses such words to describe feelings or figurative expressions about objects or concepts . For instance , Japanese barabara is used to reflect an object 's state of disarray or separation , and shiiin is the onomatopoetic form of absolute silence ( used at the time an English speaker might expect to hear the sound of crickets chirping or a pin dropping in a silent room , or someone coughing ) . It is used in English as well with terms like bling , which describes the glinting of light on things like gold , chrome or precious stones . In Japanese , kirakira is used for glittery things . </P> <H2> Examples in media </H2> <Ul> <Li> James Joyce in Ulysses ( 1922 ) coined the onomatopoeic tattarrattat for a knock on the door . It is listed as the longest palindromic word in The Oxford English Dictionary . </Li> <Li> Whaam ! ( 1963 ) by Roy Lichtenstein is an early example of pop art , featuring a reproduction of comic book art that depicts a fighter aircraft striking another with rockets with dazzling red and yellow explosions . </Li> <Li> In the 1960s TV series Batman , comic book style onomatopoeic words such as wham ! , pow ! , biff ! , crunch ! and zounds ! appear onscreen during fight scenes . </Li> <Li> Ubisoft 's XIII employed the use of comic book onomatopoeic words such as bam ! , boom ! and noooo ! during gameplay for gunshots , explosions and kills , respectively . The comic - book style is apparent throughout the game and is a core theme , and the game is an adaptation of a comic book of the same name . </Li> <Li> The chorus of American popular songwriter John Prine 's song `` Onomatopoeia '' cleverly incorporates onomatopoeic words ( though as discussed , ' ouch ! ' is not the sound of pain ) : `` Bang ! went the pistol . Crash ! went the window . Ouch ! went the son of a gun . Onomatopoeia I do n't wan na see ya Speaking in a foreign tongue . '' </Li> <Li> The marble game KerPlunk has an onomatopoeic word for a title , from the sound of marbles dropping when one too many sticks has been removed . </Li> <Li> The Nickelodeon cartoon 's title KaBlam ! is implied to be onomatapoeic to a crash . </Li> <Li> Each episode of the TV series Harper 's Island is given an onomatopoeic name which imitates the sound made in that episode when a character dies . For example , in the episode titled `` Bang '' a character is shot and fatally wounded , with the `` Bang '' mimicking the sound of the gunshot . </Li> <Li> Mad Magazine cartoonist Don Martin , already popular for his exaggerated artwork , often employed comic - book style onomatopoeic `` sound effects '' in his drawings ( for example , `` thwizzit '' is the sound of a sheet of paper being yanked from a typewriter ) . Fans have compiled The Don Martin Dictionary , cataloguing each `` sound '' and its `` meaning '' . </Li> </Ul> <H2> Cross-linguistic examples </H2> Main article : Cross-linguistic onomatopoeias <H2> In linguistics </H2> <P> A key component of language is its arbitrariness and what a word can represent , as a word is a sound created by humans with attached meaning to said sound . No one can determine the meaning of a word purely by how it sounds . However , in onomatopoeic words , these sounds are much less arbitrary ; they are connected in their imitation of other objects or sounds in nature . Vocal sounds in the imitation of natural sounds does n't necessarily gain meaning , but can gain symbolic meaning . An example of this sound symbolism in the English language is the use of words starting with sn - . Some of these words symbolize concepts related to the nose ( sneeze , snot , snore ) . This does not mean that all words with that sound relate to the nose , but at some level we recognize a sort of symbolism associated with the sound itself . Onomatopoeia , while a facet of language , is also in a sense outside of the confines of language . </P> <P> In linguistics , onomatopoeia is described as the connection , or symbolism , of a sound that is interpreted and reproduced within the context of a language , usually out of mimicry of a sound . It is a figure of speech , in a sense . Considered a vague term on its own , there are a few varying defining factors in classifying onomatopoeia . In one manner , it is defined simply as the imitation of some kind of non-vocal sound using the vocal sounds of a language , like the hum of a bee being imitated with a `` buzz '' sound . In another sense , it is described as the phenomena of making a new word entirely . </P> <P> Onomatopoeia works in the sense of symbolizing an idea in a phonological context , not necessarily constituting a direct meaningful word in the process . The symbolic properties of a sound in a word , or a phoneme , is related to a sound in an environment , and are restricted in part by a language 's own phonetic inventory , hence why many languages can have distinct onomatopoeia for the same natural sound . Depending on a language 's connection to a sound 's meaning , that language 's onomatopoeia inventory can differ proportionally . For example , a language like English generally holds little symbolic representation when it comes to sounds , which is the reason English tends to have a smaller representation of sound mimicry then a language like Japanese that overall has a much higher amount of symbolism related to the sounds of the language . </P> <H2> The evolution of language </H2> <P> In ancient Greek philosophy , onomatopoeia was used as evidence for how natural a language was : it was theorized that language itself was derived from natural sounds in the world around us . Symbolism in sounds was seen as deriving from this . Some linguists hold that onomatopoeia may have been the first form of human language . </P> <P> In the development of a language , sounds that are associated with natural objects then go on to form words with related meanings . For example , gl - at the beginning of an English word can denote something that is shining or iridescent ( e.g. glitter , glisten , gleam ) . </P> <H2> Role in early language acquisition </H2> <P> When first exposed to sound and communication , humans are biologically inclined to mimic the sounds they hear , whether they are actual pieces of language or other natural sounds . Early on in development , an infant will vary his / her utterances between sounds that are well established within the phonetic range of the language ( s ) most heavily spoken in their environment , which may be called `` tame '' onomatopoeia , and the full range of sounds that the vocal tract can produce , or `` wild '' onomatopoeia . As one begins to acquire one 's first language , the proportion of `` wild '' onomatopoeia reduces in favor of sounds which are congruent with those of the language they are acquiring . </P> <P> During the native language acquisition period , it has been documented that infants may react strongly to the more wild - speech features to which they are exposed , compared to more tame and familiar speech features . But the results of such tests are inconclusive . </P> <P> In the context of language acquisition , sound symbolism has been shown to play an important role . The association of foreign words to subjects and how they relate to general objects , such as the association of the words takete and baluma with either a round or angular shape , has been tested to see how languages symbolize sounds . </P> <H2> In other languages </H2> <H3> Japanese </H3> <P> Onomatopoeia , or giongo in Japanese , is common in the Japanese language , from day to day conversation to serious news . In general , onomatopoeia in Japanese can be categorized into three types : </P> <Ul> <Li> Giseigo : mimics humans and animals . ( e.g. WanWan for a dog 's bark ) </Li> <Li> Giongo : mimics general noises in nature or inanimate objects . ( e.g. zaazaa for rain on a roof ) </Li> <Li> Gitaigo : describes states of being , not sounds . ( e.g. mushimushi , uncomfortably warm ) </Li> </Ul> <P> Japanese also uses a system of sound symbolic words called mimetics . Though not entirely different from onomatopoeia , words that are mimetic are generally distinguished from onomatopoeia . Mimetic , or gitaigo in Japanese , words are a phonological representation of some kind of state of being , or something that does n't exactly make sound . </P> <P> Sometimes Japanese onomatopoeia produces reduplicated words . </P> <H3> Malay </H3> <P> There is a documented correlation within the Malay language of onomatopoeia that begin with the sound bu - and the implication of something that is rounded . As well as with the sound of - lok within a word conveying curvature in such words like lok , kelok and telok ( locomotive , cove and curve respectively ) . </P> <H3> Arabic </H3> <P> Within the Qur'an , written in Arabic , instances of onomatopoeia are documented . Out of about 77,701 words , there are 9 words that are onomatopoeic , 3 which are animal sounds ( e.g. `` mooing '' ) , 2 which are sounds of nature ( e.g. `` thunder '' ) and 4 that are human sounds ( e.g. `` whisper '' or `` groan '' ) . </P> <H2> See also </H2> <Ul> <Li> Anguish Languish </Li> <Li> Japanese sound symbolism </Li> <Li> List of animal sounds </Li> <Li> List of onomatopoeias </Li> <Li> Sound mimesis in various cultures </Li> <Li> Sound symbolism </Li> <Li> Vocal learning </Li> </Ul> <H2> References </H2> <H3> Notes </H3> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ Wells , John C.
