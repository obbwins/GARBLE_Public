{"document_text": "Aerial silk - wikipedia <H1> Aerial silk </H1> Jump to : navigation , search Aerial silk performer <P> Aerial silks ( also known as aerial contortion , aerial ribbons , aerial tissues , fabric , ribbon , or tissu , depending on personal preference ) is a type of performance in which one or more artists perform aerial acrobatics while hanging from a fabric . The fabric may be hung as two pieces , or a single piece , folded to make a loop , classified as hammock silks . Performers climb the suspended fabric without the use of safety lines and rely only on their training and skill to ensure safety . They use the fabric to wrap , suspend , fall , swing , and spiral their bodies into and out of various positions . Aerial silks may be used to fly through the air , striking poses and figures while flying . Some performers use dried or spray rosin on their hands and feet to increase the friction and grip on the fabric . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Tricks </Li> <Li> 2 Fabrics </Li> <Li> 3 History </Li> <Li> 4 Rigging </Li> <Li> 5 Kilo Newtons </Li> <Li> 6 See also </Li> <Li> 7 References </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Tricks ( edit ) </H2> <P> The three main categories of tricks are climbs , wraps , and drops . Climbs employed by aerialists range from purely practical and efficient , such as the Russian climb , to athletic and elegant tricks of their own , such as the straddle climb . Wraps are static poses where aerialists wrap the silks around one or more parts of their body . In general , the more complicated the wrap , the stronger the force of friction and the less effort required to hold oneself up . Some wraps , such as the straddle - back - balance , actually allow performers to completely release their hands . Foot locks are a sub-category of wraps where the silks are wrapped around one or both feet , for instance , an ankle hang . In a drop , performers wrap themselves up high on the silks before falling to a lower position . Drops can combine aspects of free fall , rolling or otherwise rotating oneself before landing in a new pose . Preparation for a drop can make for a pretty wrap , but the ultimate goal is the fall rather than the pose . Of the three trick types , drops require the most strength and are also the most potentially dangerous . Rosin ( dry or mixed with rubbing alcohol ) is employed to help performers maintain their grip . Aerial silks are a demanding art and require a high degree of strength , power , flexibility , courage , stamina , and grace to practice . </P> <H2> Fabrics ( edit ) </H2> Christianne `` Flip '' Sainz of Aerial Angels performing aerial silk at King Richard 's Faire , a renaissance faire in Massachusetts . <P> The fabrics used as silks are very strong with some give and flexibility . The fabric is 2 - way stretch polyester lycra or Tricot Nylon . The width varies depending on the routine and the acrobat . The fabric is usually quite long , as it is doubled for rigging , giving the acrobat two strips of fabric to work with as they perform . </P> <Ul> <Li> Stretch <Ul> <Li> Low stretch fabrics . Low stretch fabrics are primarily used by beginners who have not yet developed proper climbing technique . </Li> <Li> Medium stretch fabrics . Medium stretch fabrics are the principal choice of professional aerialists and graduates of professional training programs . </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> Width . Fabric width is mostly a personal choice . The thickness of the fabric when gathered is also influenced by the `` denier '' , or technical thickness of the fabric 's weave. 40 denier is a common choice . The following applies to 40 denier nylon fabric : <Ul> <Li> 60 '' - Narrow when open , thin when gathered . Fairly common simply because the fabric is widely available . </Li> <Li> 72 - 84 '' - Average for adult performers </Li> <Li> 96 '' - Wide when open , thick when gathered . Best for adults with large hands . </Li> <Li> 108 '' - Very wide and thick . For adults with very large hands , or specialty acts . </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> Length <Ul> <Li> Length is a function of the height of the space available . </Li> <Li> For beginners , it is beneficial if the fabric comes down past the ground , allowing them to practice wraps at a lower level where they can be spotted . </Li> <Li> For intermediate users and above , it is sufficient if the fabrics come down to the ground . </Li> <Li> For all users , the space required is usually between 20 feet ( 6 m ) and 30 feet ( 9 m ) . There are a great many tricks that can be done on a 12 - to - 15 - foot ( 3.7 to 4.6 m ) aerial fabric and a few drops require more than 30 feet , but for the most part 20 to 30 feet ( 6 to 9 m ) is best . </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> <H2> History ( edit ) </H2> <P> Aerial silks were invented in 1995 by Andr\u00e9 Simard , the journey began when he was hired by Cirque du Soleil to develop and research acrobatics in 1987 , his job was to discover original and imaginative ways to attract the audience to the shows . ( `` The beautiful yet dangerous art of aerial silk '' , 2010 ) . Now silks have been incorporated into circus arts as well as a form of aerial fitness . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Rigging ( edit ) </H2> <P> Aerial rigging applies to the hanging of aerial silks and hammocks . Aerial silk rigging equipment commonly includes : </P> <Ul> <Li> a figure - eight descender , rescue eight , ring , or another piece of hardware for holding the silk </Li> <Li> a ball - bearing swivel to keep the silk from twisting and to allow for spinning , which is sometimes not used but makes spinning more manageable </Li> <Li> carabiners for connecting the silk hardware to the swivel , and for connecting the swivel to a mounting point , so depending on the setup , there can be multiple carabiners in use at one time . </Li> </Ul> <P> Carabiners are the most used rigging piece for all aerial arts , but only two or three styles are safe for aerial use , these are the auto lock gate and screw gate carabiner . rated two different ways , one for the spine and one for the gate , though distributing weight on the gate is not recommended for it is about 1 / 3 of the spine kN rating . When using a carabiner for aerial arts , it is important to hook , then rotate and screw downwards , so there is little or no risk that the carabiner will accidentally open or that the screw gate will become unscrewed , also the top part of a carabiner is stronger . </P> <Ul> <Li> A span set or daisy chain can be used to add length to the silks if needed , they can also be used to wrap around a beam . </Li> <Li> A span set is a polyester loop that can hold up to 44kN ( 10,000 lbs . ) , depending on the quality . </Li> <Li> A daisy chain is made of nylon webbing with loops sewn on , to offer more length variation , but it is less strong then a span set and may not be able to withstand the downward force of drops and other aerial tricks . A basic daisy chain tops out at around 4kN ( 1,000 lbs . ) on each loop , and end to end is around 22kN ( 5,000 lbs . ) . ( Providing Hardware For Flight ) </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Kilo newtons ( edit ) </H2> <P> A KiloNewton or ( kN ) is a measurement of weight in motion . Knowing the weight that your rigging and hang point can withstand is important for your safety and the maintenance of your equipment . Example : A 100 - pound aerialist dropping 5 feet on silks , with half a foot of stopping distance and the stretch of the silks , calculates to 1,100 pounds of force exerted on rigging , silks , and person . ( Types of Carabiners and What KN Ratings Mean . ) Equation : W x ( 1 + D falling / D stopping ) Example with the equation : </P> ( weight 120 x ( 1 + distance falling ( 3 ft . ) / distance stopping ( 1 / 2 ft . ) ) The weight exerted from this drop would be 840 pounds or 3kN . <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Rope climbing </Li> <Li> Aerial hoop </Li> </Ul> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Basic Circus Arts Instruction Manual : Chapter 2 - `` Static Trapeze , Rope and Silks .
