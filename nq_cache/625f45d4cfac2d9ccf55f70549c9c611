Following financial problems brought up by the bank representative Judith , he tells his wealthy friend Eddie that he will host a singing competition with a prize of $1,000 . But Buster 's assistant , Miss Crawly , accidentally appends two extra zeroes , and the promotional fliers showing $100,000 are blown out of Buster 's office into the city streets . </P> <P> Animals from all around the city gather for auditions . Those selected include : housewife and mother of 25 piglets Rosita ; street musician mouse Mike ; mobster 's son gorilla Johnny ; punk - rock porcupine Ash ; a trio of frogs ; and a camel named Pete . Shy teenage elephant Meena fails her audition out of stage fright , while Ash 's boyfriend Lance is dismissed from the contest . Rosita is paired with another contestant , an exuberant pig named Gunter , for a dancing routine . Although Buster discovers the flyers show a prize of $100,000 , money he does not have , he remains optimistic . Buster convinces Eddie to arrange a visit with Eddie 's grandmother , former opera singer and theater actress Nana Noodleman , to persuade her to sponsor the prize money . She is hesitant to contribute , but agrees to see a private screening of the show . </P> <P> Encouraged by her grandfather , Meena tries to ask Buster for another chance , but becomes his stage hand instead . When the frogs quit , and Pete is injured , Meena is added as an act . The performers ' individual problems begin to hinder rehearsals : Rosita flounders in her dance routine with Gunter , after having been distracted by her parenting duties that have fallen into disarray . After discovering Lance with a new girlfriend and evicting them from her apartment , Ash is devastated and can no longer sing her assigned song , Carly Rae Jepsen 's `` Call Me Maybe . '' Johnny is torn between having to help his father as the driver of a getaway car in a heist and making the practices . When he tries to do both , he does not show up for the planned pickup in time , and his father and his gang are arrested . Meena does not get any help in overcoming her stage fright , and Mike , certain that the prize money is as good as his , buys a fancy car to impress a female mouse , and then swindles a group of bears in a card game in a nightclub . </P> <P> The day of the screening , the bears interrupt the show , demanding the money from Mike , who in turn , points to Buster . The bears open the chest containing the prize money , but it is nowhere near $100,000 . The glass tank full of luminescent squids that Buster got to light up the theater breaks under all their weight , flooding the theater , which then comes crashing down . With the lot repossessed by Judith , Buster , who had been living in his theater 's office desk , takes up residence at Eddie 's place ( his parents ' pool house ) . Although the contestants ( besides Mike , who saw Buster as a fraud ) visit him and try to cheer him up , Buster is too despondent to listen to them . He tries to start over by opening a car wash , using the same bucket that his father had used to earn money for Buster 's theater . </P> <P> When Meena goes to the theater 's rubble lot and sings Leonard Cohen 's `` Hallelujah , '' Buster hears her and is inspired to reinstate the show without the prize money . They perform on a makeshift stage on the lot in front of Rosita and Meena 's family members . As Rosita and Gunter perform Taylor Swift 's `` Shake It Off , '' more animals are attracted to the scene as the show is broadcast on the news . Johnny 's rendition of Elton John 's `` I 'm Still Standing '' impresses his father , who then escapes from prison to reconcile with him . Despite interruption by Judith , Ash sings her original rock song `` Set It All Free . '' Mike returns to the show and sings Frank Sinatra 's `` My Way . '' Meena finally overcomes her fears and sings Stevie Wonder 's `` Do n't You Worry ' bout a Thing , '' which literally brings down the house . The show becomes a success and impresses Nana , who was in the audience . Nana buys the lot and the theater is rebuilt and reopened . </P> <H2> Voice cast ( edit ) </H2> Matthew McConaughey , Reese Witherspoon , Scarlett Johansson , Tori Kelly , Taron Egerton , and Nick Kroll at the film 's premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival . <Ul> <Li> Matthew McConaughey as Buster Moon , an optimistic koala who plans to save his theater from closure by holding a singing competition . </Li> <Li> Reese Witherspoon as Rosita , a pig who gave up her teenage music dreams to become a devoted wife to Norman , and mother to their 25 piglets . </Li> <Li> Seth MacFarlane as Mike , a white mouse with a big Frank Sinatra-esque voice and an arrogant attitude . </Li> <Li> Scarlett Johansson as Ash , a teen porcupine and punk rocker who takes part in an alternative - rock music duo with her boyfriend Lance . </Li> <Li> John C.

'' In her review for the Los Angeles Times , Katie Walsh called Sing , `` a cute movie with genuinely funny moments ( keep an eye out for the koala car wash ) , and some great tunes to boot . '' The Arizona Republic 's Bill Goodykoontz was rather mixed about the movie in his review and overall said , `` Sing is like an album with a good song here and there , but too much filler and not enough hits . '' Reviewing the version of the film screened at the Toronto International Film Festival , Stefan Pape of the British website HeyUGuys gave the film a mixed review of 2 / 5 , stating that `` Garth Jennings 's Sing effectively acknowledges early on that it 's following a completely unoriginal formula , and yet carries on regardless . '' While Peter Debruge of Variety , who also saw the film during the same festival , did not find the subplots to have any `` profound life lessons , '' he overall praised Jennings ' direction , the cast 's voice performances and the film 's silliness . </P> <H3> Accolades ( edit ) </H3> <Table> <Tr> <Th_colspan=\"6\"> List of awards and nominations </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Award </Th> <Th> Date of ceremony </Th> <Th> </Th> <Th> Recipient ( s ) </Th> <Th> Result </Th> <Th> Ref ( s ) </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> AARP Annual Movies for Grownups Awards </Td> <Td> February 6 , 2017 </Td> <Td> Best Movie for Grownups who Refuse to Grow Up </Td> <Td> Sing </Td> <Td> Nominated </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Annie Awards </Td> <Td> February 4 , 2017 </Td> <Td> Outstanding Achievement , Music in an Animated Feature Production </Td> <Td> Joby Talbot </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Golden Globe Awards </Td> <Td> January 8 , 2017 </Td> <Td> Best Animated Feature Film </Td> <Td> Sing </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Best Original Song </Td> <Td> `` Faith '' -- Ryan Tedder , Stevie Wonder and Francis Farewell Starlite </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Hollywood Music in Media Awards </Td> <Td> November 17 , 2016 </Td> <Td> Best Song -- Animated Film </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Best Soundtrack Album </Td> <Td> Sing : Original Motion Picture Soundtrack </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Outstanding Music Supervision -- Film </Td> <Td> Jojo Villanueva </Td> <Td> Won </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Nickelodeon Kids ' Choice Awards </Td> <Td> March 11 , 2017 </Td> <Td> Favorite Animated Movie </Td> <Td> Sing </Td> <Td> Nominated </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Favorite Voice From an Animated Movie </Td> <Td> Reese Witherspoon </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Most Wanted Pet </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Favorite Soundtrack </Td> <Td> Sing </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Saturn Awards </Td> <Td> June 28 , 2017 </Td> <Td> Best Animated Film </Td> <Td> Nominated </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> </Table> <H2> Sequel ( edit ) </H2> <P> Universal and Illumination have announced plans for a Sing 2 , slated for December 25 , 2020 . </P> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> ^ Jump up to : Felperin , Leslie ( September 11 , 2016 ) . `` ' Sing ' : Film Review '' .
