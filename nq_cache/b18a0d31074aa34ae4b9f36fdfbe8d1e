It is typically associated with physical growth delays , characteristic facial features and mild to moderate intellectual disability . The average IQ of a young adult with Down syndrome is 50 , equivalent to the mental ability of an 8 - or 9 - year - old child , but this can vary widely . </P> <P> The parents of the affected individual are typically genetically normal . The extra chromosome occurs by chance . The possibility increases from less than 0.1 % in 20 - year - old mothers to 3 % in those age 45 . There is no known behavioral activity or environmental factor that changes the possibility . Down syndrome can be identified during pregnancy by prenatal screening followed by diagnostic testing or after birth by direct observation and genetic testing . Since the introduction of screening , pregnancies with the diagnosis are often terminated . Regular screening for health problems common in Down syndrome is recommended throughout the person 's life . </P> <P> There is no cure for Down syndrome . Education and proper care have been shown to improve quality of life . Some children with Down syndrome are educated in typical school classes , while others require more specialized education . Some individuals with Down syndrome graduate from high school and a few attend post-secondary education . In adulthood , about 20 % in the United States do paid work in some capacity with many requiring a sheltered work environment . Support in financial and legal matters is often needed . Life expectancy is around 50 to 60 years in the developed world with proper health care . </P> <P> Down syndrome is one of the most common chromosome abnormalities in humans . It occurs in about one per 1000 babies born each year . In 2015 , Down syndrome was present in 5.4 million individuals and resulted in 27,000 deaths down from 43,000 deaths in 1990 . It is named after John Langdon Down , the British doctor who fully described the syndrome in 1866 . Some aspects of the condition were described earlier by Jean - \u00c9tienne Dominique Esquirol in 1838 and \u00c9douard S\u00e9guin in 1844 . In 1957 , the genetic cause of Down syndrome , an extra copy of chromosome 21 , was discovered . </P> Play media Video explanation <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Signs and symptoms <Ul> <Li> 1.1 Physical </Li> <Li> 1.2 Neurological </Li> <Li> 1.3 Senses </Li> <Li> 1.4 Heart </Li> <Li> 1.5 Cancer </Li> <Li> 1.6 Endocrine </Li> <Li> 1.7 Gastrointestinal </Li> <Li> 1.8 Teeth </Li> <Li> 1.9 Fertility </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 Genetics <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Trisomy 21 </Li> <Li> 2.2 Translocation </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Mechanism <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Epigenetics </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Screening <Ul> <Li> 4.1 Ultrasound </Li> <Li> 4.2 Blood tests </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 5 Diagnosis <Ul> <Li> 5.1 Before birth </Li> <Li> 5.2 Abortion rates </Li> <Li> 5.3 After birth </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 6 Management <Ul> <Li> 6.1 Health screening </Li> <Li> 6.2 Cognitive development </Li> <Li> 6.3 Other </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 7 Prognosis </Li> <Li> 8 Epidemiology </Li> <Li> 9 History </Li> <Li> 10 Society and culture <Ul> <Li> 10.1 Name </Li> <Li> 10.2 Ethics </Li> <Li> 10.3 Advocacy groups </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 11 Research </Li> <Li> 12 References </Li> <Li> 13 External links </Li> </Ul> <H2> Signs and symptoms </H2> A drawing of the facial features of a baby with Down syndrome An eight - year - old boy with Down syndrome <P> Those with Down syndrome nearly always have physical and intellectual disabilities . As adults , their mental abilities are typically similar to those of an 8 - or 9 - year - old . They also typically have poor immune function and generally reach developmental milestones at a later age . They have an increased risk of a number of other health problems , including congenital heart defect , epilepsy , leukemia , thyroid diseases , and mental disorders , among others . </P> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Characteristics </Th> <Th> Percentage </Th> <Th> Characteristics </Th> <Th> Percentage </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Mental impairment </Td> <Td> 99 % </Td> <Td> Abnormal teeth </Td> <Td> 60 % </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Stunted growth </Td> <Td> 90 % </Td> <Td> Slanted eyes </Td> <Td> 60 % </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Umbilical hernia </Td> <Td> 90 % </Td> <Td> Shortened hands </Td> <Td> 60 % </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Increased skin back of neck </Td> <Td> 80 % </Td> <Td> Short neck </Td> <Td> 60 % </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Low muscle tone </Td> <Td> 80 % </Td> <Td> Obstructive sleep apnea </Td> <Td> 60 % </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Narrow roof of mouth </Td> <Td> 76 % </Td> <Td> Bent fifth finger tip </Td> <Td> 57 % </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Flat head </Td> <Td> 75 % </Td> <Td> Brushfield spots in the iris </Td> <Td> 56 % </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Flexible ligaments </Td> <Td> 75 % </Td> <Td> Single transverse palmar crease </Td> <Td> 53 % </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Proportionally large tongue </Td> <Td> 75 % </Td> <Td> Protruding tongue </Td> <Td> 47 % </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Abnormal outer ears </Td> <Td> 70 % </Td> <Td> Congenital heart disease </Td> <Td> 40 % </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Flattened nose </Td> <Td> 68 % </Td> <Td> Strabismus </Td> <Td> ~ 35 % </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Separation of first and second toes </Td> <Td> 68 % </Td> <Td> Undescended testicles </Td> <Td> 20 % </Td> </Tr> </Table> <H3> Physical </H3> Feet of a boy with Down syndrome <P> People with Down syndrome may have some or all of these physical characteristics : a small chin , slanted eyes , poor muscle tone , a flat nasal bridge , a single crease of the palm , and a protruding tongue due to a small mouth and relatively large tongue . These airway changes lead to obstructive sleep apnea in around half of those with Down syndrome . Other common features include : a flat and wide face , a short neck , excessive joint flexibility , extra space between big toe and second toe , abnormal patterns on the fingertips and short fingers . Instability of the atlantoaxial joint occurs in about 20 % and may lead to spinal cord injury in 1 -- 2 % . Hip dislocations may occur without trauma in up to a third of people with Down syndrome . </P> <P> Growth in height is slower , resulting in adults who tend to have short stature -- the average height for men is 154 cm ( 5 ft 1 in ) and for women is 142 cm ( 4 ft 8 in ) . Individuals with Down syndrome are at increased risk for obesity as they age . Growth charts have been developed specifically for children with Down syndrome . </P> <H3> Neurological </H3> <P> Most individuals with Down syndrome have mild ( IQ : 50 -- 69 ) or moderate ( IQ : 35 -- 50 ) intellectual disability with some cases having severe ( IQ : 20 -- 35 ) difficulties . Those with mosaic Down syndrome typically have IQ scores 10 -- 30 points higher . As they age , people with Down syndrome typically perform less well than their same - age peers . Some after 30 years of age may lose their ability to speak . This syndrome causes about a third of cases of intellectual disability . Many developmental milestones are delayed with the ability to crawl typically occurring around 8 months rather than 5 months and the ability to walk independently typically occurring around 21 months rather than 14 months . </P> <P> Commonly , individuals with Down syndrome have better language understanding than ability to speak . Between 10 and 45 % have either a stutter or rapid and irregular speech , making it difficult to understand them . They typically do fairly well with social skills . Behavior problems are not generally as great an issue as in other syndromes associated with intellectual disability . In children with Down syndrome , mental illness occurs in nearly 30 % with autism occurring in 5 -- 10 % . People with Down syndrome experience a wide range of emotions . While people with Down syndrome are generally happy , symptoms of depression and anxiety may develop in early adulthood . </P> <P> Children and adults with Down syndrome are at increased risk of epileptic seizures , which occur in 5 -- 10 % of children and up to 50 % of adults . This includes an increased risk of a specific type of seizure called infantile spasms . Many ( 15 % ) who live 40 years or longer develop Alzheimer disease . In those who reach 60 years of age , 50 -- 70 % have the disease . </P> <H3> Senses </H3> Brushfield spots , visible in the irises of a baby with Down syndrome <P> Hearing and vision disorders occur in more than half of people with Down syndrome . Vision problems occur in 38 to 80 % . Between 20 and 50 % have strabismus , in which the two eyes do not move together . Cataracts ( cloudiness of the lens of the eye ) occur in 15 % , and may be present at birth . Keratoconus ( a thin , cone - shaped cornea ) and glaucoma ( increased eye pressure ) are also more common , as are refractive errors requiring glasses or contacts . Brushfield spots ( small white or grayish / brown spots on the outer part of the iris ) are present in 38 to 85 % of individuals . </P> <P> Hearing problems are found in 50 -- 90 % of children with Down syndrome . This is often the result of otitis media with effusion which occurs in 50 -- 70 % and chronic ear infections which occur in 40 to 60 % . Ear infections often begin in the first year of life and are partly due to poor eustachian tube function . Excessive ear wax can also cause hearing loss due to obstruction of the outer ear canal . Even a mild degree of hearing loss can have negative consequences for speech , language understanding , and academics . Additionally , it is important to rule out hearing loss as a factor in social and cognitive deterioration . Age - related hearing loss of the sensorineural type occurs at a much earlier age and affects 10 -- 70 % of people with Down syndrome . </P> <H3> Heart </H3> <P> The rate of congenital heart disease in newborns with Down syndrome is around 40 % . Of those with heart disease , about 80 % have an atrioventricular septal defect or ventricular septal defect with the former being more common . Mitral valve problems become common as people age , even in those without heart problems at birth . Other problems that may occur include tetralogy of Fallot and patent ductus arteriosus . People with Down syndrome have a lower risk of hardening of the arteries . </P> <H3> Cancer </H3> <P> Although the overall risk of cancer is not changed , the risk of leukemia and testicular cancer is increased and risk of solid cancers is reduced . Solid cancers are believed to be less common due to increased expression of tumor suppressor genes present on chromosome 21 . </P> <P> Cancers of the blood are 10 to 15 times more common in children with Down syndrome . In particular , acute lymphoblastic leukemia is 20 times more common and the megakaryoblastic form of acute myeloid leukemia is 500 times more common . Transient myeloproliferative disease , a disorder of blood cell production that does not occur outside of Down syndrome , affects 3 -- 10 % of infants . The disorder is typically not serious but occasionally can be . It resolves most times without treatment ; however , in those who have had it , a 20 to 30 % risk of developing acute lymphoblastic leukemia at a later time exists . </P> <H3> Endocrine </H3> <P> Problems of the thyroid gland occur in 20 -- 50 % of individuals with Down syndrome . Low thyroid is the most common form , occurring in almost half of all individuals . Thyroid problems can be due to a poorly or nonfunctioning thyroid at birth ( known as congenital hypothyroidism ) which occurs in 1 % or can develop later due to an attack on the thyroid by the immune system resulting in Graves ' disease or autoimmune hypothyroidism . Type 1 diabetes mellitus is also more common . </P> <H3> Gastrointestinal </H3> <P> Constipation occurs in nearly half of people with Down syndrome and may result in changes in behavior . One potential cause is Hirschsprung 's disease , occurring in 2 -- 15 % , which is due to a lack of nerve cells controlling the colon . Other frequent congenital problems include duodenal atresia , pyloric stenosis , Meckel diverticulum , and imperforate anus . Celiac disease affects about 7 -- 20 % and gastroesophageal reflux disease is also more common . </P> <H3> Teeth </H3> <P> Individuals with Down syndrome tend to be more susceptible to gingivitis as well as early , severe periodontal disease , necrotising ulcerative gingivitis , and early tooth loss , especially in the lower front teeth . While plaque and poor oral hygiene are contributing factors , the severity of these periodontal disease can not be explained solely by external factors . Research suggests that the severity is likely a result of a weakened immune system . The weakened immune system also contributes to increased incidence of yeast infections in the mouth ( from Candida albicans ) . </P> <P> Individuals with Down syndrome also tend to have a more alkaline saliva resulting in a greater resistance to tooth decay , despite decreased quantities of saliva , less effective oral hygiene habits and higher plaque indexes . </P> <P> Higher rates of tooth wear and bruxism are also common . Other common oral manifestations of Down syndrome include enlarged hypotonic tongue , crusted and hypotonic lips , mouth breathing , narrow palate with crowded teeth , class III malocclusion with an underdeveloped maxilla and posterior crossbite , delayed exfoliation of baby teeth and delayed eruption of adult teeth , shorter roots on teeth , and often missing and malformed ( usually smaller ) teeth . Less common manifestations include cleft lip and palate , enamel hypocalcification ( 20 % prevalence ) . </P> <H3> Fertility </H3> <P> Males with Down syndrome usually do not father children , while females have lower rates of fertility relative to those who are unaffected . Fertility is estimated to be present in 30 -- 50 % of females . Menopause typically occurs at an earlier age . The poor fertility in males is thought to be due to problems with sperm development ; however , it may also be related to not being sexually active . As of 2006 , three instances of males with Down syndrome fathering children and 26 cases of females having children have been reported . Without assisted reproductive technologies , around half of the children of someone with Down syndrome will also have the syndrome . </P> <H2> Genetics </H2> Main article : Genetics of Down syndrome Karyotype for trisomy Down syndrome : Notice the three copies of chromosome 21 <P> Down syndrome is caused by having three copies of the genes on chromosome 21 , rather than the usual two . The parents of the affected individual are typically genetically normal . Those who have one child with Down syndrome have about a 1 % risk of having a second child with the syndrome , if both parents are found to have normal karyotypes . </P> <P> The extra chromosome content can arise through several different ways . The most common cause ( about 92 -- 95 % of cases ) is a complete extra copy of chromosome 21 , resulting in trisomy 21 . In 1.0 to 2.5 % of cases , some of the cells in the body are normal and others have trisomy 21 , known as mosaic Down syndrome . The other common mechanisms that can give rise to Down syndrome include : a Robertsonian translocation , isochromosome , or ring chromosome . These contain additional material from chromosome 21 and occur in about 2.5 % of cases . An isochromosome results when the two long arms of a chromosome separate together rather than the long and short arm separating together during egg or sperm development . </P> <H3> Trisomy 21 </H3> <P> Trisomy 21 ( also known by the karyotype 47 , XX , + 21 for females and 47 , XY , + 21 for males ) is caused by a failure of the 21st chromosome to separate during egg or sperm development . As a result , a sperm or egg cell is produced with an extra copy of chromosome 21 ; this cell thus has 24 chromosomes . When combined with a normal cell from the other parent , the baby has 47 chromosomes , with three copies of chromosome 21 . About 88 % of cases of trisomy 21 result from nonseparation of the chromosomes in the mother , 8 % from nonseparation in the father , and 3 % after the egg and sperm have merged . </P> <H3> Translocation </H3> <P> The extra chromosome 21 material may also occur due to a Robertsonian translocation in 2 -- 4 % of cases . In this situation , the long arm of chromosome 21 is attached to another chromosome , often chromosome 14 . In a male affected with Down syndrome , it results in a karyotype of 46XY , t ( 14q21q ) . This may be a new mutation or previously present in one of the parents . The parent with such a translocation is usually normal physically and mentally ; however , during production of egg or sperm cells , a higher chance of creating reproductive cells with extra chromosome 21 material exists . This results in a 15 % chance of having a child with Down syndrome when the mother is affected and a less than 5 % probability if the father is affected . The probability of this type of Down syndrome is not related to the mother 's age . Some children without Down syndrome may inherit the translocation and have a higher probability of having children of their own with Down syndrome . In this case it is sometimes known as familial Down syndrome . </P> <H2> Mechanism </H2> <P> The extra genetic material present in DS results in overexpression of a portion of the 310 genes located on chromosome 21 . This overexpression has been estimated at around 50 % . Some research has suggested the Down syndrome critical region is located at bands 21q22. 1 -- q22. 3 , with this area including genes for amyloid , superoxide dismutase , and likely the ETS2 proto oncogene . Other research , however , has not confirmed these findings . microRNAs are also proposed to be involved . </P> <P> The dementia which occurs in Down syndrome is due to an excess of amyloid beta peptide produced in the brain and is similar to Alzheimer 's disease . This peptide is processed from amyloid precursor protein , the gene for which is located on chromosome 21 . Senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are present in nearly all by 35 years of age , though dementia may not be present . Those with DS also lack a normal number of lymphocytes and produce less antibodies which contributes to their increased risk of infection . </P> <H3> Epigenetics </H3> <P> Down syndrome is associated with an increased risk of many chronic diseases that are typically associated with older age such as Alzheimer 's disease . The accelerated aging suggest that trisomy 21 increases the biological age of tissues , but molecular evidence for this hypothesis is sparse . According to a biomarker of tissue age known as epigenetic clock , trisomy 21 increases the age of blood and brain tissue ( on average by 6.6 years ) . </P> <H2> Screening </H2> <P> Guidelines recommend screening for Down syndrome to be offered to all pregnant women , regardless of age . A number of tests are used , with varying levels of accuracy . They are typically used in combination to increase the detection rate . None can be definitive , thus if screening is positive , either amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling is required to confirm the diagnosis . Screening in both the first and second trimesters is better than just screening in the first trimester . The different screening techniques in use are able to pick up 90 to 95 % of cases with a false - positive rate of 2 to 5 % . </P> <Table> First - and second - trimester screening <Tr> <Th> Screen </Th> <Th> Week of pregnancy when performed </Th> <Th> Detection rate </Th> <Th> False positive </Th> <Th> Description </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Combined test </Td> <Td> 10 -- 13.5 wks </Td> <Td> 82 -- 87 % </Td> <Td> 5 % </Td> <Td> Uses ultrasound to measure nuchal translucency in addition to blood tests for free or total beta - hCG and PAPP - A </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Quad screen </Td> <Td> 15 -- 20 wks </Td> <Td> 81 % </Td> <Td> 5 % </Td> <Td> Measures the maternal serum alpha - fetoprotein , unconjugated estriol , hCG , and inhibin - A </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Integrated test </Td> <Td> 15 -- 20 wks </Td> <Td> 94 -- 96 % </Td> <Td> 5 % </Td> <Td> Is a combination of the quad screen , PAPP - A , and NT </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Cell - free fetal DNA </Td> <Td> From 10 wks </Td> <Td> 96 -- 100 % </Td> <Td> 0.3 % </Td> <Td> A blood sample is taken from the mother by venipuncture and is sent for DNA analysis . </Td> </Tr> </Table> <H3> Ultrasound </H3> Ultrasound of fetus with Down syndrome showing a large bladder Enlarged NT and absent nasal bone in a fetus at 11 weeks with Down syndrome <P> Ultrasound imaging can be used to screen for Down syndrome . Findings that indicate increased risk when seen at 14 to 24 weeks of gestation include a small or no nasal bone , large ventricles , nuchal fold thickness , and an abnormal right subclavian artery , among others . The presence or absence of many markers is more accurate . Increased fetal nuchal translucency ( NT ) indicates an increased risk of Down syndrome picking up 75 -- 80 % of cases and being falsely positive in 6 % . </P> <H3> Blood tests </H3> <P> Several blood markers can be measured to predict the risk of Down syndrome during the first or second trimester . Testing in both trimesters is sometimes recommended and test results are often combined with ultrasound results . In the second trimester , often two or three tests are used in combination with two or three of : \u03b1 - fetoprotein , unconjugated estriol , total hCG , and free \u03b2hCG detecting about 60 -- 70 % of cases . </P> <P> Testing of the mother 's blood for fetal DNA is being studied and appears promising in the first trimester . The International Society for Prenatal Diagnosis considers it a reasonable screening option for those women whose pregnancies are at a high risk for trisomy 21 . Accuracy has been reported at 98.6 % in the first trimester of pregnancy . Confirmatory testing by invasive techniques ( amniocentesis , CVS ) is still required to confirm the screening result . </P> <H2> Diagnosis </H2> <H3> Before birth </H3> <P> When screening tests predict a high risk of Down syndrome , a more invasive diagnostic test ( amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling ) is needed to confirm the diagnosis . If Down syndrome occurs in one in 500 pregnancies and the test used has a 5 % false - positive rate , this means , of 26 women who test positive on screening , only one will have Down syndrome confirmed . If the screening test has a 2 % false - positive rate , this means one of eleven who test positive on screening have a fetus with DS . Amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling are more reliable tests , but they increase the risk of miscarriage between 0.5 and 1 % . The risk of limb problems is increased in the offspring due to the procedure . The risk from the procedure is greater the earlier it is performed , thus amniocentesis is not recommended before 15 weeks gestational age and chorionic villus sampling before 10 weeks gestational age . </P> <H3> Abortion rates </H3> <P> About 92 % of pregnancies in Europe with a diagnosis of Down syndrome are terminated . In the United States , termination rates are around 67 % , but this rate varied from 61 % to 93 % among different populations evaluated . When nonpregnant people are asked if they would have a termination if their fetus tested positive , 23 -- 33 % said yes , when high - risk pregnant women were asked , 46 -- 86 % said yes , and when women who screened positive are asked , 89 -- 97 % say yes . </P> <H3> After birth </H3> <P> The diagnosis can often be suspected based on the child 's physical appearance at birth . An analysis of the child 's chromosomes is needed to confirm the diagnosis , and to determine if a translocation is present , as this may help determine the risk of the child 's parents having further children with Down syndrome . Parents generally wish to know the possible diagnosis once it is suspected and do not wish pity . </P> <H2> Management </H2> <P> Efforts such as early childhood intervention , screening for common problems , medical treatment where indicated , a good family environment , and work - related training can improve the development of children with Down syndrome . Education and proper care can improve quality of life . Raising a child with Down syndrome is more work for parents than raising an unaffected child . Typical childhood vaccinations are recommended . </P> <H3> Health screening </H3> <Table> Recommended screening <Tr> <Th> Testing </Th> <Th> Children </Th> <Th> Adults </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Hearing </Td> <Td> 6 months , 12 months , then yearly </Td> <Td> 3 -- 5 years </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> T4 and TSH </Td> <Td> 6 months , then yearly </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Eyes </Td> <Td> 6 months , then yearly </Td> <Td> 3 -- 5 years </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Teeth </Td> <Td> 2 years , then every 6 months </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Coeliac disease </Td> <Td> Between 2 and 3 years of age , or earlier if symptoms occur </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Sleep study </Td> <Td> 3 to 4 years , or earlier if symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea occur </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Neck X-rays </Td> <Td> Between 3 and 5 years of age </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> A number of health organizations have issued recommendations for screening those with Down syndrome for particular diseases . This is recommended to be done systematically . </P> <P> At birth , all children should get an electrocardiogram and ultrasound of the heart . Surgical repair of heart problems may be required as early as three months of age . Heart valve problems may occur in young adults , and further ultrasound evaluation may be needed in adolescents and in early adulthood . Due to the elevated risk of testicular cancer , some recommend checking the person 's testicles yearly . </P> <H3> Cognitive development </H3> <P> Hearing aids or other amplification devices can be useful for language learning in those with hearing loss . Speech therapy may be useful and is recommended to be started around 9 months of age . As those with Down syndrome typically have good hand - eye coordination , learning sign language may be possible . Augmentative and alternative communication methods , such as pointing , body language , objects , or pictures , are often used to help with communication . Behavioral issues and mental illness are typically managed with counseling or medications . </P> <P> Education programs before reaching school age may be useful . School - age children with Down syndrome may benefit from inclusive education ( whereby students of differing abilities are placed in classes with their peers of the same age ) , provided some adjustments are made to the curriculum . Evidence to support this , however , is not very strong . In the United States , the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act of 1975 requires public schools generally to allow attendance by students with Down syndrome . </P> <P> Individuals with Down syndrome may learn better visually . Drawing may help with language , speech , and reading skills . Children with Down syndrome still often have difficulty with sentence structure and grammar , as well as developing the ability to speak clearly . Several types of early intervention can help with cognitive development . Efforts to develop motor skills include physical therapy , speech and language therapy , and occupational therapy . Physical therapy focuses specifically on motor development and teaching children to interact with their environment . Speech and language therapy can help prepare for later language . Lastly , occupational therapy can help with skills needed for later independence . </P> <H3> Other </H3> <P> Tympanostomy tubes are often needed and often more than one set during the person 's childhood . Tonsillectomy is also often done to help with sleep apnea and throat infections . Surgery , however , does not always address the sleep apnea and a continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) machine may be useful . Physical therapy and participation in physical education may improve motor skills . Evidence to support this in adults , however , is not very good . </P> <P> Efforts to prevent respiratory syncytial virus ( RSV ) infection with human monoclonal antibodies should be considered , especially in those with heart problems . In those who develop dementia there is no evidence for memantine , donepezil , rivastigmine , or galantamine . </P> <P> Plastic surgery has been suggested as a method of improving the appearance and thus the acceptance of people with Down syndrome . It has also been proposed as a way to improve speech . Evidence , however , does not support a meaningful difference in either of these outcomes . Plastic surgery on children with Down syndrome is uncommon , and continues to be controversial . The U.S. National Down Syndrome Society views the goal as one of mutual respect and acceptance , not appearance . </P> <P> Many alternative medical techniques are used in Down syndrome ; however , they are poorly supported by evidence . These include : dietary changes , massage , animal therapy , chiropractics and naturopathy , among others . Some proposed treatments may also be harmful . </P> <H2> Prognosis </H2> Deaths due to Down syndrome per million persons in 2012 0 -- 0 1 -- 1 2 -- 2 3 -- 3 4 -- 4 5 -- 5 6 -- 6 7 -- 8 9 -- 16 <P> Between 5 and 15 % of children with Down syndrome in Sweden attend regular school . Some graduate from high school ; however , most do not . Of those with intellectual disability in the United States who attended high school about 40 % graduated . Many learn to read and write and some are able to do paid work . In adulthood about 20 % in the United States do paid work in some capacity . In Sweden , however , less than 1 % have regular jobs . Many are able to live semi-independently , but they often require help with financial , medical , and legal matters . Those with mosaic Down syndrome usually have better outcomes . </P> <P> Individuals with Down syndrome have a higher risk of early death than the general population . This is most often from heart problems or infections . Following improved medical care , particularly for heart and gastrointestinal problems , the life expectancy has increased . This increase has been from 12 years in 1912 , to 25 years in the 1980s , to 50 to 60 years in the developed world in the 2000s . Currently between 4 and 12 % die in the first year of life . The probability of long - term survival is partly determined by the presence of heart problems . In those with congenital heart problems 60 % survive to 10 years and 50 % survive to 30 years of age . In those without heart problems 85 % survive to 10 years and 80 % survive to 30 years of age . About 10 % live to 70 years of age . The National Down Syndrome Society have developed information regarding the positive aspects of life with Down syndrome . </P> <H2> Epidemiology </H2> The risk of having a Down syndrome pregnancy in relation to a mother 's age <P> Globally , as of 2010 , Down syndrome occurs in about 1 per 1000 births and results in about 17,000 deaths . More children are born with Down syndrome in countries where abortion is not allowed and in countries where pregnancy more commonly occurs at a later age . About 1.4 per 1000 live births in the United States and 1.1 per 1000 live births in Norway are affected . In the 1950s , in the United States , it occurred in 2 per 1000 live births with the decrease since then due to prenatal screening and abortions . The number of pregnancies with Down syndrome is more than two times greater with many spontaneously aborting . It is the cause of 8 % of all congenital disorders . </P> <P> Maternal age affects the chances of having a pregnancy with Down syndrome . At age 20 , the chance is one in 1441 ; at age 30 , it is one in 959 ; at age 40 , it is one in 84 ; and at age 50 it is one in 44 . Although the probability increases with maternal age , 70 % of children with Down syndrome are born to women 35 years of age and younger , because younger people have more children . The father 's older age is also a risk factor in women older than 35 , but not in women younger than 35 , and may partly explain the increase in risk as women age . </P> <H2> History </H2> It has been suggested that this Early Netherlandish painting depicts a person with Down syndrome as one of the angels . <P> English physician John Langdon Down first described Down syndrome in 1862 , recognizing it as a distinct type of mental disability , and again in a more widely published report in 1866 . \u00c9douard S\u00e9guin described it as separate from cretinism in 1944 . By the 20th century , Down syndrome had become the most recognizable form of mental disability . </P> <P> In antiquity , many infants with disabilities were either killed or abandoned . A number of historical pieces of art are believed to portray Down syndrome , including pottery from AD 500 from South America and the 16th - century painting The Adoration of the Christ Child . </P> <P> In the 20th century , many individuals with Down syndrome were institutionalized , few of the associated medical problems were treated , and most died in infancy or early adult life . With the rise of the eugenics movement , 33 of the then 48 U.S. states and several countries began programs of forced sterilization of individuals with Down syndrome and comparable degrees of disability . Action T4 in Nazi Germany made public policy of a program of systematic involuntary euthanization . </P> <P> With the discovery of karyotype techniques in the 1950s , it became possible to identify abnormalities of chromosomal number or shape . In 1959 , J\u00e9r\u00f4me Lejeune reported the discovery that Down syndrome resulted from an extra chromosome . However , Lejeune 's claim to the discovery has been disputed , and in 2014 , the Scientific Council of the French Federation of Human Genetics unanimously awarded its Grand Prize to his colleague Marthe Gautier for her role in this discovery . The discovery was in the laboratory of Raymond Turpin at the H\u00f4pital Trousseau in Paris , France . J\u00e9r\u00f4me Lejeune and Marthe Gautier were both his students . </P> <P> As a result of this discovery , the condition became known as trisomy 21 . Even before the discovery of its cause , the presence of the syndrome in all races , its association with older maternal age , and its rarity of recurrence had been noticed . Medical texts had assumed it was caused by a combination of inheritable factors that had not been identified . Other theories had focused on injuries sustained during birth . </P> <H2> Society and culture </H2> See also : List of people with Down syndrome <H3> Name </H3> <P> Due to his perception that children with Down syndrome shared facial similarities with those of Blumenbach 's Mongolian race , John Langdon Down used the term `` mongoloid '' . He felt that the existence of Down syndrome confirmed that all peoples were genetically related . In the 1950s with discovery of the underlying cause as being related to chromosomes , concerns about the race - based nature of the name increased . </P> <P> In 1961 , 19 scientists suggested that `` mongolism '' had `` misleading connotations '' and had become `` an embarrassing term '' . The World Health Organization ( WHO ) dropped the term in 1965 after a request by the delegation from the Mongolian People 's Republic . While the term mongoloid ( also mongolism , Mongolian imbecility or idiocy ) continued to be used until the early 1980s , it is now considered unacceptable and is no longer in common use . </P> <P> In 1975 , the United States National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) convened a conference to standardize the naming and recommended replacing the possessive form , `` Down 's syndrome '' with `` Down syndrome '' . However , both the possessive and nonpossessive forms remain in use by the general population . The term `` trisomy 21 '' is also used frequently . </P> <H3> Ethics </H3> Father with son who has Down syndrome <P> Some obstetricians argue that not offering screening for Down syndrome is unethical . As it is a medically reasonable procedure , per informed consent , people should at least be given information about it . It will then be the woman 's choice , based on her personal beliefs , how much or how little screening she wishes . When results from testing become available , it is also considered unethical not to give the results to the person in question . </P> <P> Some bioethicists deem it reasonable for parents to select a child who would have the highest well - being . One criticism of this reasoning is that it often values those with disabilities less . Some parents argue that Down syndrome should n't be prevented or cured and that eliminating Down syndrome amounts to genocide . The disability rights movement does not have a position on screening , although some members consider testing and abortion discriminatory . Some in the United States who are pro-life support abortion if the fetus is disabled , while others do not . Of a group of 40 mothers in the United States who have had one child with Down syndrome , half agreed to screening in the next pregnancy . </P> <P> Within the US , some Protestants denominations see abortion as acceptable when a fetus has Down syndrome , while Orthodox Christians and Roman Catholics often do not . Some of those against screening refer to it as a form of `` eugenics '' . Disagreement exists within Islam regarding the acceptability of abortion in those carrying a fetus with Down syndrome . Some Islamic countries allow abortion , while others do not . Women may face stigmatization whichever decision they make . </P> <H3> Advocacy groups </H3> <P> Advocacy groups for individuals with Down syndrome began to be formed after the Second World War . These were organizations advocating for the inclusion of people with Down syndrome into the general school system and for a greater understanding of the condition among the general population , as well as groups providing support for families with children living with Down syndrome . Before this individuals with Down syndrome were often placed in mental hospitals or asylums . Organizations included the Royal Society for Handicapped Children and Adults founded in the UK in 1946 by Judy Fryd , Kobato Kai founded in Japan in 1964 , the National Down Syndrome Congress founded in the United States in 1973 by Kathryn McGee and others , and the National Down Syndrome Society founded in 1979 in the United States . </P> <P> The first World Down Syndrome Day was held on 21 March 2006 . The day and month were chosen to correspond with 21 and trisomy , respectively . It was recognized by the United Nations General Assembly in 2011 . </P> <H2> Research </H2> See also : Down syndrome research and Mouse models of Down syndrome <P> Efforts are underway to determine how the extra chromosome 21 material causes Down syndrome , as currently this is unknown , and to develop treatments to improve intelligence in those with the syndrome . One hope is to use stem cells . Other methods being studied include the use of antioxidants , gamma secretase inhibition , adrenergic agonists , and memantine . Research is often carried out on an animal model , the Ts65Dn mouse . </P> <H2> References </H2> <Ol> <Li> ^ Jump up to : Weijerman , ME ; de Winter , JP ( Dec 2010 ) . `` Clinical practice .
