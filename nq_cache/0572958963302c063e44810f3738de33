Resources are so scarce that all crimes , no matter how small , are punishable by death , unless the perpetrator is under 18 years of age . </P> <P> The 100 begins with Clarke Griffin , a former medical student , being arrested for a crime committed by her parents : conducting illegal experiments on children under threat of the corrupt Vice Chancellor Rhodes . Clarke confides in her best friend Wells , The Chancellor 's son . Despite swearing secrecy to Clarke , Wells tells his father , hoping to save the Griffins from Rhodes . His plan backfires , the Griffins are arrested , and his relationship with Clarke disintegrates . Two years later , the Colony decides to send 100 of its teenage prisoners to investigate whether or not Earth is habitable . Among the 100 are Clarke , Wells , Octavia Blake , her older brother Bellamy Blake , and Clarke 's friend , Thalia . </P> <P> The group crashes somewhere on the East Coast in the former United States . Once there , the 100 struggle to survive in a world very different from the past Earth . Clarke tends to the wounded , and Bellamy gradually develops a romantic interest in her . It is revealed that Octavia had become a drug addict while in prison . A few days later , someone sets fire to the camp , killing Thalia . As the survivors investigate , they discover a farm not too far from the site , leading them to the realization that they are not alone . </P> <H3> The 100 : Day 21 ( edit ) </H3> <P> Twenty - one days after they land on Earth , the 100 continue to face recurring attacks from an unknown enemy . Octavia has been missing since the fire . Wells tries to maintain morale , while Bellamy tries to find his sister . The 100 find an Earthborn girl , Sasha Walgrove , and hold her hostage . Sasha tells them that they have landed in the former state of Virginia , and that there are people from the Colony who arrived before the 100 . Bellamy believes that Sasha 's people are responsible for Octavia 's disappearance and demands that Sasha reveal their location . Wells and Sasha bond , and Sasha helps Wells find food for the surviving colonists . </P> <P> In space , the people of the Colony fight to get into their drop ships as the space station 's life support begins to fail ; Clarke and Wells ' friends , Glass and Luke , are among the people desperately trying to get to Earth . However , they find themselves at the mercy of Vice Chancellor Rhodes , who is willing to kill to get into one of the dropships . </P> <P> Sasha leads Clarke and Bellamy to a colony beneath the ruins of Mount Weather Emergency Operations Center . There , they meet her father , Max Walgrove , who is the leader of the colony . Octavia is at Mount Weather , having been rescued by Max and his people from a group of renegades . These renegades are responsible for the attacks on the 100 . Max and his people promise that they will continue helping the 100 , and will provide further support once the rest of the Colony arrives . At this point , they find dropships from the Colony falling from the sky . </P> <P> Wells eventually realizes that there is something familiar about Bellamy and Octavia ; ultimately , he discovers that their mother was Melinda Blake , the woman his father had loved before marrying Wells ' mother for the sake of his career . This discovery leads Wells and Bellamy to realize that they are paternal half - brothers . </P> <H3> The 100 : Homecoming ( edit ) </H3> <P> After the dropships crash , Clarke , Bellamy , and Wells lead a rescue party to the crash site , allowing Clarke and Wells to reunite with Glass and Luke . Clarke ponders leaving the camp to search for her parents . The Chancellor , still in a coma , remains trapped in the Colony above Earth . Vice Chancellor Rhodes takes control over the community on Earth , planning to force Luke to execute Bellamy , as a warning to anyone attempting to challenge him . </P> <P> With Sasha 's help , Clarke and Wells escape with the wounded Bellamy . In addition , Glass and Luke flee the camp to escape Vice Chancellor Rhodes . One of Rhodes ' men kills Sasha when she tries to get more supplies . Rhodes plans to attack Mount Weather to recapture Bellamy , Clarke , and Wells . As Mount Weather prepares for Rhodes ' attack , some of the Colonists revolt and join their benefactors against Rhodes . Clarke , Bellamy , and Wells are captured during the initial exchange , but another faction of Earthborns defeat and capture Rhodes before he can execute Bellamy . Later , more colonists from other dropships arrive , and one of the arrivals informs Wells that his father was still in a coma , with only a few hours of oxygen left when their dropship departed . </P> <P> Before Sasha 's funeral , Clarke reunites with her parents at Mount Weather . She reconciles with Wells but will not resume their past relationship because she is romantically involved with Bellamy . </P> <H3> The 100 : Rebellion ( edit ) </H3> <P> A fourth novel , Rebellion , was released on December 6 , 2016 . A month after the previous novel , Bellamy begins showing signs of what Clarke thinks is paranoia when he obsesses over small details in the woods . However , a group of self - proclaimed `` Protectors '' infiltrates their camp and abducts several of its inhabitants , including Wells , Glass and Octavia . As Clarke and Bellamy organize a rescue team to take their new enemy down , their relationship is put to the ultimate test when Bellamy does n't think Clarke trusts him . </P> <P> Eventually , the rescue team and prisoners are able to take the Protectors down as a team effort and in the aftermath , Clarke and Bellamy make up and with her parents ' blessing , he asks her to marry him . </P> <H2> Reception ( edit ) </H2> <P> Publisher Weekly commented that Morgan 's flair for the dramatic in The 100 `` can be forced , but it 's easy to be drawn in '' . In addition , Booklist calls The 100 `` dark and riveting '' , blending `` science fiction , romance , and characters ' shadow sides with a mostly engrossing plotline . The 100 reached # 13 on The New York Times ' Young Adult Best Seller List . </P> <P> Kirkus Reviews commented Day 21 is `` faster paced than '' its predecessor . </P> <H2> Television adaptation ( edit ) </H2> Main article : The 100 ( TV series ) <P> On May 9 , 2013 , The CW Television Network announced that the pilot was officially ordered to series for the 2013 -- 14 American television season .
