It is an application of Keynesian thinking and principles to a practical economic problem and a relatively late text . Keynes died in 1946 . </P> <H2> Summary ( edit ) </H2> <P> In How to Pay for the War , John Maynard Keynes describes a macroeconomic strategy of how Britain , a nation with a population at the time of 40 million people , could conduct a long war against Germany , a nation of 80 millions . At the time How to Pay for the War was written , neither the United States nor the Soviet Union were at war with either Germany or Japan . As a result , the first step for Britain to effectively conduct a war against Germany was to mobilize all its resources for production . Thus , the first two chapters of How to Pay for the War , are an argument for the need for full employment and chapter 3 , Our Output Capacity and The National Income , is a manual to achieve full employment . </P> <P> Keynes maintained , however , that the resources of Britain , even at full employment , would not suffice to conduct a war against Germany . Internally , Britain would need to increase production while reducing consumption and diverting resources to the war effort . Externally , Britain would have to be able to count on more resources than internally available , running as large a deficit as its allies were willing to allow . Chapters IV ( 4 ) to X ( 10 ) and appendices II ( 2 ) to IV ( 4 ) are dedicated to measures for allocating resources to the war effort , while controlling prices and reducing wartime consumption . </P> <P> Keynes outlined a plan for Deferred Pay that would , in part , be legislated in the Budget of Sir Kingsley Wood , Chancellor of the Exchequer . The deferred pay became a system of post-war credits which were progressively repaid after the war , albeit at reduced value . </P> <P> Keynes devotes much attention to price controls , proposing a number of measures to control ( but not planning to eliminate ) inflation , measures including deferred pay and forced savings . Most of the book , Chapters IV to X , is dedicated to the problems of resource allocation and price control . </P> <P> The book is an exercise in Keynesian macroeconomics , a prime example of Keynesian analysis and technique , by John Maynard Keynes himself . </P> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ http://REMOVED_SECRET/commons/1972/mar/09/post-war-credits </Li> </Ol> Retrieved from `` https://REMOVED_SECRET/w/index.php?title=How_to_Pay_for_the_War:_A_Radical_Plan_for_the_Chancellor_of_the_Exchequer&oldid=812162533 '' Categories : <Ul> <Li> Strategy </Li> <Li> Keynesian economics </Li> <Li> Inflation </Li> <Li> Books by John Maynard Keynes </Li> <Li> Full employment </Li> </Ul> Hidden categories : <Ul> <Li> Articles needing additional references from October 2016 </Li> <Li> All articles needing additional references </Li> </Ul> <H2> </H2> <H3> </H3> <Ul> <Li> </Li> <Li> Talk </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> </Ul> <H3> </H3> <Ul> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> </Ul> <H3> </H3> <Ul> </Ul> <H3> </H3> <Ul> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> </Ul> <H3> </H3> <Ul> </Ul> <H3> </H3> <H3> </H3> <Ul> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> </Ul> <H3> </H3> <Ul> <Li> </Li> <Li> About Wikipedia </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> </Ul> <H3> </H3> <Ul> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> </Ul> <H3> </H3> <Ul> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> </Ul> <H3> </H3> <Ul> </Ul> Add links <Ul> <Li> This page was last edited on 26 November 2017 , at 09 : 45 . </Li> <Li> </Li> </Ul> <Ul> <Li> </Li> <Li> About Wikipedia </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> </Ul> <Ul> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> </Ul>", "long_answer_candidates": [{"start_token": 42, "top_level": true, "end_token": 93}, {"start_token": 43, "top_level": false, "end_token": 92}, {"start_token": 101, "top_level": true, "end_token": 162}, {"start_token": 168, "top_level": true, "end_token": 313}, {"start_token": 313, "top_level": true, "end_token": 431}, {"start_token": 431, "top_level": true, "end_token": 483}, {"start_token": 483, "top_level": true, "end_token": 539}, {"start_token": 539, "top_level": true, "end_token": 565}], "question_text": "who wrote an article on war finance titled how to pay for the war", "annotations": [{"yes_no_answer": "NONE", "long_answer": {"start_token": 101, "candidate_index": 2, "end_token": 162}, "short_answers": [{"start_token": 122, "end_token": 125}], "annotation_id": 12269265242255981144}], "document_url": "https://REMOVED_SECRET//w/index.php?title=How_to_Pay_for_the_War:_A_Radical_Plan_for_the_Chancellor_of_the_Exchequer&amp;oldid=812162533", "example_id": -8172208811783219257}
