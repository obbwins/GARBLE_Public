{"document_text": "Space Race - Wikipedia <H1> Space Race </H1> This article is about the Cold War rivalry between the United States and Soviet Union . For various space races , see List of space races . For other uses of the term , see Space Race ( disambiguation ) . <P> </P> The Soviet Union achieved an early lead in the Space Race by launching the first artificial satellite Sputnik 1 ( replica shown ) in 1957 . The United States led during the `` Moon race '' by landing Neil Armstrong ( pictured ) and Buzz Aldrin on the Moon , July 20 , 1969 . Astronaut Thomas P. Stafford and cosmonaut Aleksei Leonov shake hands in space to ease Cold War tensions . <P> The Space Race refers to the 20th - century competition between two Cold War rivals , the Soviet Union ( USSR ) and the United States ( US ) , for dominance in spaceflight capability . It had its origins in the missile - based nuclear arms race between the two nations that occurred following World War II , aided by captured German missile technology and personnel from the Aggregat program . The technological superiority required for such dominance was seen as necessary for national security , and symbolic of ideological superiority . The Space Race spawned pioneering efforts to launch artificial satellites , uncrewed space probes of the Moon , Venus , and Mars , and human spaceflight in low Earth orbit and to the Moon . </P> <P> The Space Race began on August 2 , 1955 , when the Soviet Union responded to the US announcement four days earlier of intent to launch artificial satellites for the International Geophysical Year , by declaring they would also launch a satellite `` in the near future '' . The Soviet Union beat the US to this , with the October 4 , 1957 , orbiting of Sputnik 1 , and later beat the US to the first human in space , Yuri Gagarin , on April 12 , 1961 . The `` race '' peaked with the July 20 , 1969 , US landing of the first humans on the Moon with Apollo 11 . The USSR tried but failed crewed lunar missions , and eventually canceled them and concentrated on Earth orbital space stations . </P> <P> A period of d\u00e9tente followed with the April 1972 agreement on a co-operative Apollo -- Soyuz Test Project , resulting in the July 1975 rendezvous in Earth orbit of a US astronaut crew with a Soviet cosmonaut crew . The end of the Space Race is harder to pinpoint than its beginning , but it was over by the December 1991 dissolution of the Soviet Union , after which true spaceflight cooperation between the US and Russia began . </P> <P> The Space Race has left a legacy of Earth communications and weather satellites , and continuing human space presence on the International Space Station . It has also sparked increases in spending on education and research and development , which led to beneficial spin - off technologies . </P> <H2> Contents </H2> <Ul> <Li> 1 Early rocket development <Ul> <Li> 1.1 Germany during World War II </Li> <Li> 1.2 Soviet rocket development </Li> <Li> 1.3 American rocket development </Li> <Li> 1.4 Cold War missile race </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 The Race begins <Ul> <Li> 2.1 First artificial satellite </Li> <Li> 2.2 US reaction </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Uncrewed lunar probes </Li> <Li> 4 First human in space </Li> <Li> 5 First American in space </Li> <Li> 6 Kennedy directs the Race toward the Moon </Li> <Li> 7 Completion of Vostok and Mercury programs <Ul> <Li> 7.1 Mercury </Li> <Li> 7.2 Vostok </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 8 Kennedy proposes a joint US - USSR program </Li> <Li> 9 Gemini and Voskhod <Ul> <Li> 9.1 Voskhod program </Li> <Li> 9.2 Project Gemini </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 10 Soviet crewed Moon programs </Li> <Li> 11 Outer space treaty </Li> <Li> 12 Disaster strikes both sides </Li> <Li> 13 Onward to the Moon </Li> <Li> 14 Apollo 11 </Li> <Li> 15 The Race winds down <Ul> <Li> 15.1 Salyuts and Skylab </Li> <Li> 15.2 Apollo -- Soyuz Test Project </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 16 Legacy <Ul> <Li> 16.1 Human spaceflight after Apollo </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 17 See also </Li> <Li> 18 Notes </Li> <Li> 19 References </Li> <Li> 20 External links </Li> </Ul> <H2> Early rocket development ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Germany during World War II ( edit ) </H3> Wernher von Braun ( 1912 -- 1977 ) , technical director of Nazi Germany 's missile program , became the United States ' lead rocket engineer during the 1950s and 1960s <P> The origins of the Space Race can be traced to Germany , beginning in the 1930s and continuing during World War II when Nazi Germany researched and built operational ballistic missiles capable of sub-orbital spaceflight . Starting in the early 1930s , during the last stages of the Weimar Republic , German aerospace engineers experimented with liquid - fueled rockets , with the goal that one day they would be capable of reaching high altitudes and traversing long distances . The head of the German Army 's Ballistics and Munitions Branch , Lieutenant Colonel Karl Emil Becker , gathered a small team of engineers that included Walter Dornberger and Leo Zanssen , to figure out how to use rockets as long - range artillery in order to get around the Treaty of Versailles ' ban on research and development of long - range cannons . Wernher von Braun , a young engineering prodigy , was recruited by Becker and Dornberger to join their secret army program at Kummersdorf - West in 1932 . Von Braun dreamed of conquering outer space with rockets and did not initially see the military value in missile technology . </P> <P> During the Second World War , General Dornberger was the military head of the army 's rocket program , Zanssen became the commandant of the Peenem\u00fcnde army rocket center , and von Braun was the technical director of the ballistic missile program . They led the team that built the Aggregate - 4 ( A-4 ) rocket , which became the first vehicle to reach outer space during its test flight program in 1942 and 1943 . By 1943 , Germany began mass - producing the A-4 as the Vergeltungswaffe 2 ( `` Vengeance Weapon '' 2 , or more commonly , V2 ) , a ballistic missile with a 320 kilometers ( 200 mi ) range carrying a 1,130 kilograms ( 2,490 lb ) warhead at 4,000 kilometers per hour ( 2,500 mph ) . Its supersonic speed meant there was no defense against it , and radar detection provided little warning . Germany used the weapon to bombard southern England and parts of Allied - liberated western Europe from 1944 until 1945 . After the war , the V - 2 became the basis of early American and Soviet rocket designs . </P> <P> At war 's end , American , British , and Soviet scientific intelligence teams competed to capture Germany 's rocket engineers along with the German rockets themselves and the designs on which they were based . Each of the Allies captured a share of the available members of the German rocket team , but the United States benefited the most with Operation Paperclip , recruiting von Braun and most of his engineering team , who later helped develop the American missile and space exploration programs . The United States also acquired a large number of complete V2 rockets . </P> <H3> Soviet rocket development ( edit ) </H3> Further information : Soviet rocketry `` Chief Designer '' Sergei Korolev ( left ) , with the `` father of the Soviet atomic bomb '' Igor Kurchatov , and `` Chief Theoretician '' Mstislav Keldysh in 1956 <P> The German rocket center in Peenem\u00fcnde was located in the eastern part of Germany , which became the Soviet zone of occupation . On Stalin 's orders , the Soviet Union sent its best rocket engineers to this region to see what they could salvage for future weapons systems . The Soviet rocket engineers were led by Sergei Korolev . He had been involved in space clubs and early Soviet rocket design in the 1930s , but was arrested in 1938 during Joseph Stalin 's Great Purge and imprisoned for six years in Gulag . After the war , he became the USSR 's chief rocket and spacecraft engineer , essentially the Soviet counterpart to von Braun . His identity was kept a state secret throughout the Cold War , and he was identified publicly only as `` the Chief Designer . '' In the West , his name was only officially revealed when he died in 1966 . </P> <P> After almost a year in the area around Peenem\u00fcnde , Soviet officials conducted Operation Osoaviakhim and later moved more than 170 of the top captured German rocket specialists to Gorodomlya Island on Lake Seliger , about 240 kilometers ( 150 mi ) northwest of Moscow . They were not allowed to participate in final Soviet missile design , but were used as problem - solving consultants to the Soviet engineers . They helped in the following areas : the creation of a Soviet version of the A-4 ; work on `` organizational schemes '' ; research in improving the A-4 main engine ; development of a 100 - ton engine ; assistance in the `` layout '' of plant production rooms ; and preparation of rocket assembly using German components . With their help , particularly Helmut Gr\u00f6ttrup 's group , Korolev reverse - engineered the A-4 and built his own version of the rocket , the R - 1 , in 1948 . Later , he developed his own distinct designs , though many of these designs were influenced by the Gr\u00f6ttrup Group 's G4 - R10 design from 1949 . The Germans were eventually repatriated in 1951 -- 53 . </P> <H3> American rocket development ( edit ) </H3> <P> The American professor Robert H. Goddard had worked on developing solid - fuel rockets since 1914 , and demonstrated a light battlefield rocket to the US Army Signal Corps only five days before the signing of the armistice that ended World War I. He also started developing liquid - fueled rockets in 1921 , yet he had not been taken seriously by the public . </P> <P> Von Braun and his team were sent to the United States Army 's White Sands Proving Ground , located in New Mexico , in 1945 . They set about assembling the captured V2s and began a program of launching them and instructing American engineers in their operation . These tests led to the first rocket to take photos from outer space , and the first two - stage rocket , the WAC Corporal - V2 combination , in 1949 . The German rocket team was moved from Fort Bliss to the Army 's new Redstone Arsenal , located in Huntsville , Alabama , in 1950 . From here , von Braun and his team developed the Army 's first operational medium - range ballistic missile , the Redstone rocket , that in slightly modified versions , launched both America 's first satellite , and the first piloted Mercury space missions . It became the basis for both the Jupiter and Saturn family of rockets . </P> <H3> Cold War missile Race ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Nuclear arms race The cold war would become the great engine , the supreme catalyst , that sent rockets and their cargoes far above Earth and worlds away . If Tsiolkovsky , Oberth , Goddard , and others were the fathers of rocketry , the competition between capitalism and communism was its midwife . <P> William E. Burrows , This New Ocean , `` The Other World Series '' , p. 147 </P> <P> The Cold War ( 1947 -- 1991 ) developed between two former allies , the Soviet Union and the United States , soon after the end of the Second World War . It involved a continuing state of political conflict , military tension , proxy wars , and economic competition , primarily between the Soviet Union and its satellite states ( often referred to as the Eastern Bloc ) , and the powers of the Western world , particularly the United States . The primary participants ' military forces never clashed directly , but expressed this conflict through military coalitions , strategic conventional force deployments , extensive aid to states deemed vulnerable , proxy wars , espionage , propaganda , a nuclear arms race , and economic and technological competitions , such as the Space Race . </P> <P> In simple terms , the Cold War could be viewed as an expression of the ideological struggle between communism and capitalism . The United States faced a new uncertainty beginning in September 1949 , when it lost its monopoly on the atomic bomb . American intelligence agencies discovered that the Soviet Union had exploded its first atomic bomb , with the consequence that the United States potentially could face a future nuclear war that , for the first time , might devastate its cities . Given this new danger , the United States participated in an arms race with the Soviet Union that included development of the hydrogen bomb , as well as intercontinental strategic bombers and intercontinental ballistic missiles ( ICBMs ) capable of delivering nuclear weapons . A new fear of communism and its sympathizers swept the United States during the 1950s , which devolved into paranoid McCarthyism . With communism spreading in China , Korea , and Eastern Europe , Americans came to feel so threatened that popular and political culture condoned extensive `` witch - hunts '' to expose communist spies . Part of the American reaction to the Soviet atomic and hydrogen bomb tests included maintaining a large Air Force , under the control of the Strategic Air Command ( SAC ) . SAC employed intercontinental strategic bombers , as well as medium - bombers based close to Soviet airspace ( in western Europe and in Turkey ) that were capable of delivering nuclear payloads . </P> <P> For its part , the Soviet Union harbored fears of invasion . Having suffered at least 27 million casualties during World War II after being invaded by Nazi Germany in 1941 , the Soviet Union was wary of its former ally , the United States , which until late 1949 was the sole possessor of atomic weapons . The United States had used these weapons operationally during World War II , and it could use them again against the Soviet Union , laying waste to its cities and military centers . Since the Americans had a much larger air force than the Soviet Union , and the United States maintained advance air bases near Soviet territory , in 1947 Stalin ordered the development of intercontinental ballistic missiles ( ICBMs ) in order to counter the perceived American threat . </P> Soviet R - 7 ICBM , and its derivative launch vehicles for Sputnik , Vostok , Voskhod , and Soyuz <P> In 1953 , Korolev was given the go - ahead to develop the R - 7 Semyorka rocket , which represented a major advance from the German design . Although some of its components ( notably boosters ) still resembled the German G - 4 , the new rocket incorporated staged design , a completely new control system , and a new fuel . It was successfully tested on August 21 , 1957 , and became the world 's first fully operational ICBM the following month . It was later used to launch the first satellite into space , and derivatives launched all piloted Soviet spacecraft . </P> <P> The United States had multiple rocket programs divided among the different branches of the American armed services , which meant that each force developed its own ICBM program . The Air Force initiated ICBM research in 1945 with the MX - 774 . However , its funding was cancelled and only three partially successful launches were conducted in 1947 . In 1950 , von Braun began testing the Air Force PGM - 11 Redstone rocket family at Cape Canaveral . In 1951 , the Air Force began a new ICBM program called MX - 1593 , and by 1955 this program was receiving top - priority funding . The MX - 1593 program evolved to become the Atlas - A , with its maiden launch occurring June 11 , 1957 , becoming the first successful American ICBM . Its upgraded version , the Atlas - D rocket , later served as a nuclear ICBM and as the orbital launch vehicle for Project Mercury and the remote - controlled Agena Target Vehicle used in Project Gemini . </P> <P> With the Cold War as an engine for change in the ideological competition between the United States and the Soviet Union , a coherent space policy began to take shape in the United States during the late 1950s . Korolev took inspiration from the competition as well , achieving many firsts to counter the possibility that the United States might prevail . </P> <H2> The Race begins ( edit ) </H2> Further information : Soviet space program and Space policy of the United States <H3> First artificial satellite ( edit ) </H3> <P> In 1955 , with both the United States and the Soviet Union building ballistic missiles that could be utilized to launch objects into space , the `` starting line '' was drawn for the Space Race . In separate announcements four days apart , both nations publicly announced that they would launch artificial Earth satellites by 1957 or 1958 . On July 29 , 1955 , James C. Hagerty , president Dwight D. Eisenhower 's press secretary , announced that the United States intended to launch `` small Earth circling satellites '' between July 1 , 1957 , and December 31 , 1958 , as part of their contribution to the International Geophysical Year ( IGY ) . Four days later , at the Sixth Congress of International Astronautical Federation in Copenhagen , scientist Leonid I. Sedov spoke to international reporters at the Soviet embassy , and announced his country 's intention to launch a satellite as well , in the `` near future '' . On August 30 , 1955 , Korolev managed to get the Soviet Academy of Sciences to create a commission whose purpose was to beat the Americans into Earth orbit : this was the de facto start date for the Space Race . The Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union began a policy of treating development of its space program as a classified state secret . </P> <P> Initially , President Eisenhower was worried that a satellite passing above a nation at over 100 kilometers ( 62 mi ) , might be construed as violating that nation 's sovereign airspace . He was concerned that the Soviet Union would accuse the Americans of an illegal overflight , thereby scoring a propaganda victory at his expense . Eisenhower and his advisors believed that a nation 's airspace sovereignty did not extend into outer space , acknowledged as the K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line , and he used the 1957 -- 58 International Geophysical Year launches to establish this principle in international law . Eisenhower also feared that he might cause an international incident and be called a `` warmonger '' if he were to use military missiles as launchers . Therefore , he selected the untried Naval Research Laboratory 's Vanguard rocket , which was a research - only booster . This meant that von Braun 's team was not allowed to put a satellite into orbit with their Jupiter - C rocket , because of its intended use as a future military vehicle . On September 20 , 1956 , von Braun and his team did launch a Jupiter - C that was capable of putting a satellite into orbit , but the launch was used only as a suborbital test of nose cone reentry technology . </P> <P> Korolev received word about von Braun 's 1956 Jupiter - C test , but thinking it was a satellite mission that failed , he expedited plans to get his own satellite in orbit . Since his R - 7 was substantially more powerful than any of the American boosters , he made sure to take full advantage of this capability by designing Object D as his primary satellite . It was given the designation ' D ' , to distinguish it from other R - 7 payload designations ' A ' , ' B ' , ' V ' , and ' G ' which were nuclear weapon payloads . Object D dwarfed the proposed American satellites , by having a weight of 1,400 kilograms ( 3,100 lb ) , of which 300 kilograms ( 660 lb ) would be composed of scientific instruments that would photograph the Earth , take readings on radiation levels , and check on the planet 's magnetic field . However , things were not going along well with the design and manufacturing of the satellite , so in February 1957 , Korolev sought and received permission from the Council of Ministers to create a prosteishy sputnik ( PS - 1 ) , or simple satellite . The Council also decreed that Object D be postponed until April 1958 . The new sputnik was a shiny sphere that would be a much lighter craft , weighing 83.8 kilograms ( 185 lb ) and having a 58 - centimeter ( 23 in ) diameter . The satellite would not contain the complex instrumentation that Object D had , but had two radio transmitters operating on different short wave radio frequencies , the ability to detect if a meteoroid were to penetrate its pressure hull , and the ability to detect the density of the Earth 's thermosphere . </P> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> Beep ... beep ... beep The signals of Sputnik 1 continued for 22 days </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan=\"2\"> Problems playing this file ? See media help . </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> Korolev was buoyed by the first successful launches of his R - 7 rocket in August and September , which paved the way for him to launch his sputnik . Word came that the Americans were planning to announce a major breakthrough at an International Geophysical Year conference at the National Academy of Sciences in Washington D.C. , with a paper entitled `` Satellite Over the Planet '' , on October 6 , 1957 . Korolev anticipated that von Braun might launch a Jupiter - C with a satellite payload on or around October 4 or 5 , in conjunction with the paper . He hastened the launch , moving it to October 4 . The launch vehicle for PS - 1 , was a modified R - 7 -- vehicle 8K71PS number M1 - PS -- without much of the test equipment and radio gear that was present in the previous launches . It arrived at the Soviet missile base Tyura - Tam in September and was prepared for its mission at launch site number one . On Friday , October 4 , 1957 , at exactly 10 : 28 : 34 pm Moscow time , the R - 7 , with the now named Sputnik 1 satellite , lifted off the launch pad , and placed this artificial `` moon '' into an orbit a few minutes later . This `` fellow traveler , '' as the name is translated in English , was a small , beeping ball , less than two feet in diameter and weighing less than 200 pounds . But the celebrations were muted at the launch control center until the down - range far east tracking station at Kamchatka received the first distinctive beep ... beep ... beep sounds from Sputnik 1 's radio transmitters , indicating that it was on its way to completing its first orbit . About 95 minutes after launch , the satellite flew over its launch site , and its radio signals were picked up by the engineers and military personnel at Tyura - Tam : that 's when Korolev and his team celebrated the first successful artificial satellite placed into Earth - orbit . </P> <H3> US reaction ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Sputnik crisis <P> The Soviet success raised a great deal of concern in the United States . For example , economist Bernard Baruch wrote in an open letter titled `` The Lessons of Defeat '' to the New York Herald Tribune : `` While we devote our industrial and technological power to producing new model automobiles and more gadgets , the Soviet Union is conquering space ... It is Russia , not the United States , who has had the imagination to hitch its wagon to the stars and the skill to reach for the moon and all but grasp it . America is worried . It should be . '' </P> <P> Eisenhower ordered project Vanguard to move up its timetable and launch its satellite much sooner than originally planned . The December 6 , 1957 Project Vanguard launch failure occurred at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida , broadcast live in front of a US television audience . It was a monumental failure , exploding a few seconds after launch , and it became an international joke . The satellite appeared in newspapers under the names Flopnik , Stayputnik , Kaputnik , and Dudnik . In the United Nations , the Russian delegate offered the US representative aid `` under the Soviet program of technical assistance to backwards nations . '' Only in the wake of this very public failure did von Braun 's Redstone team get the go - ahead to launch their Jupiter - C rocket as soon as they could . In Britain , the US 's Western Cold War ally , the reaction was mixed : some celebrated the fact that the Soviets had reached space first , while others feared the destructive potential that military uses of spacecraft might bring . </P> William Hayward Pickering , James Van Allen , and Wernher von Braun display a full - scale model of Explorer 1 at a Washington , DC news conference after confirmation the satellite was in orbit <P> On January 31 , 1958 , nearly four months after the launch of Sputnik 1 , von Braun and the United States successfully launched its first satellite on a four - stage Juno I rocket derived from the US Army 's Redstone missile , at Cape Canaveral . The satellite Explorer 1 was 30.66 pounds ( 13.91 kg ) in mass . The payload of Explorer 1 weighed 18.35 pounds ( 8.32 kg ) . It carried a micrometeorite gauge and a Geiger - M\u00fcller tube . It passed in and out of the Earth - encompassing radiation belt with its 194 - by - 1,368 - nautical - mile ( 360 by 2,534 km ) orbit , therefore saturating the tube 's capacity and proving what Dr. James Van Allen , a space scientist at the University of Iowa , had theorized . The belt , named the Van Allen radiation belt , is a doughnut - shaped zone of high - level radiation intensity around the Earth above the magnetic equator. Van Allen was also the man who designed and built the satellite instrumentation of Explorer 1 . The satellite measured three phenomena : cosmic ray and radiation levels , the temperature in the spacecraft , and the frequency of collisions with micrometeorites . The satellite had no memory for data storage , therefore it had to transmit continuously . In March 1958 a second satellite was sent into orbit with augmented cosmic ray instruments . </P> <P> On April 2 , 1958 , President Eisenhower reacted to the Soviet space lead in launching the first satellite , by recommending to the US Congress that a civilian agency be established to direct nonmilitary space activities . Congress , led by Senate Majority Leader Lyndon B. Johnson , responded by passing the National Aeronautics and Space Act , which Eisenhower signed into law on July 29 , 1958 . This law turned the National Advisory Committee on Aeronautics into the National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( NASA ) . It also created a Civilian - Military Liaison Committee , chaired by the President , responsible for coordinating the nation 's civilian and military space programs . </P> <P> On October 21 , 1959 , Eisenhower approved the transfer of the Army 's remaining space - related activities to NASA . On July 1 , 1960 , the Redstone Arsenal became NASA 's George C. Marshall Space Flight Center , with von Braun as its first director . Development of the Saturn rocket family , which when mature , gave the US parity with the Soviets in terms of lifting capability , was thus transferred to NASA . </P> <H2> Uncrewed lunar probes ( edit ) </H2> <P> In 1958 , Korolev upgraded the R - 7 to be able to launch a 400 - kilogram ( 880 lb ) payload to the Moon . Three secret 1958 attempts to launch Luna E-1 - class impactor probes failed . The fourth attempt , Luna 1 , launched successfully on January 2 , 1959 , but missed the Moon . The fifth attempt on June 18 also failed at launch . The 390 - kilogram ( 860 lb ) Luna 2 successfully impacted the Moon on September 14 , 1959 . The 278.5 - kilogram ( 614 lb ) Luna 3 successfully flew by the Moon and sent back pictures of its far side on October 6 , 1959 . </P> <P> The US reacted to the Luna program by embarking on the Ranger program in 1959 , managed by NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory . The Block I Ranger 1 and Ranger 2 suffered Atlas - Agena launch failures in August and November 1961 . The 727 - pound ( 330 kg ) Block II Ranger 3 launched successfully on January 26 , 1962 , but missed the Moon . The 730 - pound ( 330 kg ) Ranger 4 became the first US spacecraft to reach the Moon , but its solar panels and navigational system failed near the Moon and it impacted the far side without returning any scientific data . Ranger 5 ran out of power and missed the Moon by 725 kilometers ( 391 nmi ) on October 21 , 1962 . The first successful Ranger mission was the 806 - pound ( 366 kg ) Block III Ranger 7 which impacted on July 31 , 1964 . </P> <H2> First human in space ( edit ) </H2> Yuri Gagarin , the first person in space , 1961 <P> By 1959 , American observers believed that the Soviet Union would be the first to get a human into space , because of the time needed to prepare for Mercury 's first launch . On April 12 , 1961 , the USSR surprised the world again by launching Yuri Gagarin into a single orbit around the Earth in a craft they called Vostok 1 . They dubbed Gagarin the first cosmonaut , roughly translated from Russian and Greek as `` sailor of the universe '' . Although he had the ability to take over manual control of his capsule in an emergency by opening an envelope he had in the cabin that contained a code that could be typed into the computer , it was flown in an automatic mode as a precaution ; medical science at that time did not know what would happen to a human in the weightlessness of space . Vostok 1 orbited the Earth for 108 minutes and made its reentry over the Soviet Union , with Gagarin ejecting from the spacecraft at 7,000 meters ( 23,000 ft ) , and landing by parachute . The F\u00e9d\u00e9ration A\u00e9ronautique Internationale ( International Federation of Aeronautics ) credited Gagarin with the world 's first human space flight , although their qualifying rules for aeronautical records at the time required pilots to take off and land with their craft . For this reason , the Soviet Union omitted from their FAI submission the fact that Gagarin did not land with his capsule . When the FAI filing for Gherman Titov 's second Vostok flight in August 1961 disclosed the ejection landing technique , the FAI committee decided to investigate , and concluded that the technological accomplishment of human spaceflight lay in the safe launch , orbiting , and return , rather than the manner of landing , and revised their rules , keeping Gagarin 's and Titov 's records intact . </P> <P> Gagarin became a national hero of the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc , and a worldwide celebrity . Moscow and other cities in the USSR held mass demonstrations , the scale of which was second only to the World War II Victory Parade of 1945 . April 12 was declared Cosmonautics Day in the USSR , and is celebrated today in Russia as one of the official `` Commemorative Dates of Russia . '' In 2011 , it was declared the International Day of Human Space Flight by the United Nations . </P> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> Poyekhali ! Gagarin 's voice </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan=\"2\"> Problems playing this file ? See media help . </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> The radio communication between the launch control room and Gagarin included the following dialogue at the moment of rocket launch : </P> <P> Korolev : `` Preliminary stage ... intermediate ... main ... lift off ! We wish you a good flight . Everything is all right . '' </P> <P> Gagarin : `` \u041f\u043e\u0435\u0445\u0430\u043b\u0438 ! '' ( Poyekhali ! - Let 's go ! ) . </P> <P> Gagarin 's informal poyekhali ! became a historical phrase in the Eastern Bloc , used to refer to the beginning of the human space flight era . </P> <H2> First American in space ( edit ) </H2> Alan Shepard , the first American in space , 1961 <P> The US Air Force had been developing a program to launch the first man in space , named Man in Space Soonest . This program studied several different types of one - man space vehicles , settling on a ballistic re-entry capsule launched on a derivative Atlas missile , and selecting a group of nine candidate pilots . After NASA 's creation , the program was transferred over to the civilian agency and renamed Project Mercury on November 26 , 1958 . NASA selected a new group of astronaut ( from the Greek for `` star sailor '' ) candidates from Navy , Air Force and Marine test pilots , and narrowed this down to a group of seven for the program . Capsule design and astronaut training began immediately , working toward preliminary suborbital flights on the Redstone missile , followed by orbital flights on the Atlas . Each flight series would first start uncrewed , then carry a non-human primate , then finally humans . </P> <P> On May 5 , 1961 , Alan Shepard became the first American in space , launched in a ballistic trajectory on Mercury - Redstone 3 , in a spacecraft he named Freedom 7 . Though he did not achieve orbit like Gagarin , he was the first person to exercise manual control over his spacecraft 's attitude and retro - rocket firing . After his successful return , Shepard was celebrated as a national hero , honored with parades in Washington , New York and Los Angeles , and received the NASA Distinguished Service Medal from President John F. Kennedy . </P> <H2> Kennedy directs the Race toward the Moon ( edit ) </H2> See also : Moon landing These are extraordinary times . And we face an extraordinary challenge .

Now it is time to take longer strides -- time for a great new American enterprise -- time for this nation to take a clearly leading role in space achievement , which in many ways may hold the key to our future on Earth . </P> <P> ... Recognizing the head start obtained by the Soviets with their large rocket engines , which gives them many months of lead - time , and recognizing the likelihood that they will exploit this lead for some time to come in still more impressive successes , we nevertheless are required to make new efforts on our own . </P> ... I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal , before this decade is out , of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth . No single space project in this period will be more impressive to mankind , or more important for the long - range exploration of space , and none will be so difficult or expensive to accomplish . <P> John F. Kennedy , Special Message to Congress on Urgent National Needs , May 25 , 1961 </P> <P> Before Gagarin 's flight , US President John F. Kennedy 's support for America 's crewed space program was lukewarm . Jerome Wiesner of MIT , who served as a science advisor to presidents Eisenhower and Kennedy , and himself an opponent of crewed space exploration , remarked , `` If Kennedy could have opted out of a big space program without hurting the country in his judgment , he would have . '' As late as March 1961 , when NASA administrator James E. Webb submitted a budget request to fund a Moon landing before 1970 , Kennedy rejected it because it was simply too expensive . Some were surprised by Kennedy 's eventual support of NASA and the space program because of how often he had attacked the Eisenhower administration 's inefficiency during the election . </P> <P> Gagarin 's flight changed this ; now Kennedy sensed the humiliation and fear on the part of the American public over the Soviet lead . Additionally , the Bay of Pigs invasion , planned before his term began but executed during it , was an embarrassment to his administration due to the colossal failure of the American forces . Looking for something to save political face , he sent a memo dated April 20 , 1961 , to Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson , asking him to look into the state of America 's space program , and into programs that could offer NASA the opportunity to catch up . The two major options at the time seemed to be , either establishment of an Earth orbital space station , or a crewed landing on the Moon . Johnson , in turn , consulted with von Braun , who answered Kennedy 's questions based on his estimates of US and Soviet rocket lifting capability . Based on this , Johnson responded to Kennedy , concluding that much more was needed to reach a position of leadership , and recommending that the crewed Moon landing was far enough in the future that the US had a fighting chance to achieve it first . </P> <P> Kennedy ultimately decided to pursue what became the Apollo program , and on May 25 took the opportunity to ask for Congressional support in a Cold War speech titled `` Special Message on Urgent National Needs '' . Full text </P> <P> He justified the program in terms of its importance to national security , and its focus of the nation 's energies on other scientific and social fields . He rallied popular support for the program in his `` We choose to go to the Moon '' speech , on September 12 , 1962 , before a large crowd at Rice University Stadium , in Houston , Texas , near the construction site of the new Manned Spacecraft Center facility . Full text </P> <P> Khrushchev responded to Kennedy 's implicit challenge with silence , refusing to publicly confirm or deny the Soviets were pursuing a `` Moon race '' . As later disclosed , the Soviet Union secretly pursued a crewed lunar program until 1974 . </P> <H2> Completion of Vostok and Mercury programs ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Mercury ( edit ) </H3> John Glenn , the first American in orbit , 1962 <P> American Virgil `` Gus '' Grissom repeated Shepard 's suborbital flight in Liberty Bell 7 on July 21 , 1961 . Almost a year after the Soviet Union put a human into orbit , astronaut John Glenn became the first American to orbit the Earth , on February 20 , 1962 . His Mercury - Atlas 6 mission completed three orbits in the Friendship 7 spacecraft , and splashed down safely in the Atlantic Ocean , after a tense reentry , due to what falsely appeared from the telemetry data to be a loose heat - shield . As the first American in orbit , Glenn became a national hero , and received a ticker - tape parade in New York City , reminiscent of that given for Charles Lindbergh . On February 23 , 1962 , President Kennedy escorted him in a parade at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station , where he awarded Glenn with the NASA service medal . </P> <P> The United States launched three more Mercury flights after Glenn 's : Aurora 7 on May 24 , 1962 , duplicated Glenn 's three orbits ; Sigma 7 on October 3 , 1962 , six orbits ; and Faith 7 on May 15 , 1963 , 22 orbits ( 32.4 hours ) , the maximum capability of the spacecraft . NASA at first intended to launch one more mission , extending the spacecraft 's endurance to three days , but since this would not beat the Soviet record , it was decided instead to concentrate on developing Project Gemini . </P> <H3> Vostok ( edit ) </H3> Replica of the Vostok capsule <P> Gherman Titov became the first Soviet cosmonaut to exercise manual control of his Vostok 2 craft on August 6 , 1961 . The Soviet Union demonstrated 24 - hour launch pad turnaround and the capability to launch two piloted spacecraft , Vostok 3 and Vostok 4 , in essentially identical orbits , on August 11 and 12 , 1962 . The two spacecraft came within approximately 6.5 kilometers ( 4.0 mi ) of one another , close enough for radio communication . Vostok 4 also set a record of nearly four days in space . Though the two craft 's orbits were as nearly identical as possible given the accuracy of the launch rocket 's guidance system , slight variations still existed which drew the two craft at first as close to each other as 6.5 kilometers ( 3.5 nautical miles ) , then as far apart as 2,850 kilometers ( 1,540 nautical miles ) . There were no maneuvering rockets on the Vostok to permit space rendezvous , required to keep two spacecraft a controlled distance apart . </P> Valentina Tereshkova <P> The Soviet Union duplicated its dual - launch feat with Vostok 5 and Vostok 6 ( June 16 , 1963 ) . This time they launched the first woman ( also the first civilian ) , Valentina Tereshkova , into space on Vostok 6 . Launching a woman was reportedly Korolev 's idea , and it was accomplished purely for propaganda value . Tereshkova was one of a small corps of female cosmonauts who were amateur parachutists , but Tereshkova was the only one to fly . The USSR did n't again open its cosmonaut corps to women until 1980 , two years after the United States opened its astronaut corps to women . </P> <P> The Soviets kept the details and true appearance of the Vostok capsule secret until the April 1965 Moscow Economic Exhibition , where it was first displayed without its aerodynamic nose cone concealing the spherical capsule . The `` Vostok spaceship '' had been first displayed at the July 1961 Tushino air show , mounted on its launch vehicle 's third stage , with the nose cone in place . A tail section with eight fins was also added , in an apparent attempt to confuse western observers . This spurious tail section also appeared on official commemorative stamps and a documentary . </P> <H2> Kennedy proposes a joint US - USSR program ( edit ) </H2> <P> On September 20 , 1963 , in a speech before the United Nations General Assembly , President Kennedy proposed that the United States and the Soviet Union join forces in an effort to reach the Moon . Kennedy thus changed his mind regarding the desirability of the space race , preferring instead to ease tensions with the Soviet Union by cooperating on projects such as a joint lunar landing . Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev initially rejected Kennedy 's proposal . However , on October 2 , 1997 , it was reported that Khrushchev 's son Sergei claimed Khrushchev was poised to accept Kennedy 's proposal at the time of Kennedy 's assassination on November 22 , 1963 . During the next few weeks he reportedly concluded that both nations might realize cost benefits and technological gains from a joint venture , and decided to accept Kennedy 's offer based on a measure of rapport during their years as leaders of the world 's two superpowers , but changed his mind and dropped the idea since he did not have the same trust for Kennedy 's successor , Lyndon Johnson . </P> <P> As President , Johnson steadfastly pursued the Gemini and Apollo programs , promoting them as Kennedy 's legacy to the American public . One week after Kennedy 's death , he issued an executive order renaming the Cape Canaveral and Apollo launch facilities after Kennedy . </P> <H2> Gemini and Voskhod ( edit ) </H2> <P> Focused by the commitment to a Moon landing , in January 1962 the US announced Project Gemini , a two - man spacecraft that would support the later three - man Apollo by developing the key spaceflight technologies of space rendezvous and docking of two craft , flight durations of sufficient length to simulate going to the Moon and back , and extra-vehicular activity to accomplish useful work outside the spacecraft . </P> <P> Meanwhile , Korolev had planned further , long - term missions for the Vostok spacecraft , and had four Vostoks in various stages of fabrication in late 1963 at his OKB - 1 facilities . At that time , the Americans announced their ambitious plans for the Project Gemini flight schedule . These plans included major advancements in spacecraft capabilities , including a two - person spacecraft , the ability to change orbits , the capacity to perform an extravehicular activity ( EVA ) , and the goal of docking with another spacecraft . These represented major advances over the previous Mercury or Vostok capsules , and Korolev felt the need to try to beat the Americans to many of these innovations . Korolev already had begun designing the Vostok 's replacement , the next - generation Soyuz spacecraft , a multi-cosmonaut spacecraft that had at least the same capabilities as the Gemini spacecraft . Soyuz would not be available for at least three years , and it could not be called upon to deal with this new American challenge in 1964 or 1965 . Political pressure in early 1964 -- which some sources claim was from Khrushchev while other sources claim was from other Communist Party officials -- pushed him to modify his four remaining Vostoks to beat the Americans to new space firsts in the size of flight crews , and the duration of missions . </P> <H3> Voskhod program ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Voskhod programme The Voskhod 1 and 2 space capsules <P> The greater advances of the Soviet space program at the time allowed their space program to achieve other significant firsts , including the first EVA `` spacewalk '' and the first mission performed by a crew in shirt - sleeves . Gemini took a year longer than planned to accomplish its first flight , allowing the Soviets to achieve another first , launching Voskhod 1 on October 12 , 1964 , the first spacecraft with a three - cosmonaut crew . The USSR touted another technological achievement during this mission : it was the first space flight during which cosmonauts performed in a shirt - sleeve - environment . However , flying without spacesuits was not due to safety improvements in the Soviet spacecraft 's environmental systems ; rather this innovation was accomplished because the craft 's limited cabin space did not allow for spacesuits . Flying without spacesuits exposed the cosmonauts to significant risk in the event of potentially fatal cabin depressurization . This feat was not repeated until the US Apollo Command Module flew in 1968 ; this later mission was designed from the outset to safely transport three astronauts in a shirt - sleeve environment while in space . </P> <P> Between October 14 -- 16 , 1964 , Leonid Brezhnev and a small cadre of high - ranking Communist Party officials , deposed Khrushchev as Soviet government leader a day after Voskhod 1 landed , in what was called the `` Wednesday conspiracy '' . The new political leaders , along with Korolev , ended the technologically troublesome Voskhod program , cancelling Voskhod 3 and 4 , which were in the planning stages , and started concentrating on the race to the Moon . Voskhod 2 ended up being Korolev 's final achievement before his death on January 14 , 1966 , as it became the last of the many space firsts that demonstrated the USSR 's domination in spacecraft technology during the early 1960s . According to historian Asif Siddiqi , Korolev 's accomplishments marked `` the absolute zenith of the Soviet space program , one never , ever attained since . '' There was a two - year pause in Soviet piloted space flights while Voskhod 's replacement , the Soyuz spacecraft , was designed and developed . </P> <P> On March 18 , 1965 , about a week before the first American piloted Project Gemini space flight , the USSR accelerated the competition , by launching the two - cosmonaut Voskhod 2 mission with Pavel Belyayev and Alexey Leonov . Voskhod 2 's design modifications included the addition of an inflatable airlock to allow for extravehicular activity ( EVA ) , also known as a spacewalk , while keeping the cabin pressurized so that the capsule 's electronics would not overheat . Leonov performed the first - ever EVA as part of the mission . A fatality was narrowly avoided when Leonov 's spacesuit expanded in the vacuum of space , preventing him from re-entering the airlock . In order to overcome this , he had to partially depressurize his spacesuit to a potentially dangerous level . He succeeded in safely re-entering the ship , but he and Belyayev faced further challenges when the spacecraft 's atmospheric controls flooded the cabin with 45 % pure oxygen , which had to be lowered to acceptable levels before re-entry . The reentry involved two more challenges : an improperly timed retrorocket firing caused the Voskhod 2 to land 386 kilometers ( 240 mi ) off its designated target area , the town of Perm ; and the instrument compartment 's failure to detach from the descent apparatus caused the spacecraft to become unstable during reentry . </P> Progress in the Space Race , showing the US passing the Soviets in 1965 <H3> Project Gemini ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Project Gemini Rendezvous of Gemini 6 and 7 , December 1965 <P> Though delayed a year to reach its first flight , Gemini was able to take advantage of the USSR 's two - year hiatus after Voskhod , which enabled the US to catch up and surpass the previous Soviet lead in piloted spaceflight . Gemini achieved several significant firsts during the course of ten piloted missions : </P> <Ul> <Li> On Gemini 3 ( March 1965 ) , astronauts Virgil `` Gus '' Grissom and John W. Young became the first to demonstrate their ability to change their craft 's orbit . </Li> <Li> On Gemini 5 ( August 1965 ) , astronauts L. Gordon Cooper and Charles `` Pete '' Conrad set a record of almost eight days in space , long enough for a piloted lunar mission . </Li> <Li> On Gemini 6A ( December 1965 ) , Command Pilot Wally Schirra achieved the first space rendezvous with Gemini 7 , accurately matching his orbit to that of the other craft , station - keeping for three consecutive orbits at distances as close as 1 foot ( 0.30 m ) . </Li> <Li> Gemini 7 also set a human spaceflight endurance record of fourteen days for Frank Borman and James A. Lovell , which stood until both nations started launching space laboratories in the early 1970s . </Li> <Li> On Gemini 8 ( March 1966 ) , Command Pilot Neil Armstrong achieved the first docking between two spacecraft , his Gemini craft and an Agena target vehicle . </Li> <Li> Gemini 11 ( September 1966 ) , commanded by Conrad , achieved the first direct - ascent rendezvous with its Agena target on the first orbit , and used the Agena 's rocket to achieve an apogee of 742 nautical miles ( 1,374 km ) , the crewed Earth orbit record still current as of 2015 . </Li> <Li> On Gemini 12 ( November 1966 ) , Edwin E. `` Buzz '' Aldrin spent over five hours working comfortably during three ( EVA ) sessions , finally proving that humans could perform productive tasks outside their spacecraft . This proved to be the most difficult goal to achieve . </Li> </Ul> <P> Most of the novice pilots on the early missions would command the later missions . In this way , Project Gemini built up spaceflight experience for the pool of astronauts for the Apollo lunar missions . </P> <H2> Soviet crewed Moon programs ( edit ) </H2> Main article : Soviet crewed lunar programs Soyuz 7K - L3 ( Lunniy Orbitalny Korabl ) , alongside the Apollo Command / Service Module to scale LK lunar lander ( Lunniy Korabl ) , alongside the Apollo Lunar Module to scale <P> Korolev 's design bureau produced two prospectuses for circumlunar spaceflight ( March 1962 and May 1963 ) , the main spacecraft for which were early versions of his Soyuz design . Soviet Communist Party Central Committee Command 655 - 268 officially established two secret , competing crewed programs for circumlunar flights and lunar landings , on August 3 , 1964 . The circumlunar flights were planned to occur in 1967 , and the landings to start in 1968 . </P> <P> The circumlunar program ( Zond ) , created by Vladimir Chelomey 's design bureau OKB - 52 , was to fly two cosmonauts in a stripped - down Soyuz 7K - L1 , launched by Chelomey 's Proton UR - 500 rocket . The Zond sacrificed habitable cabin volume for equipment , by omitting the Soyuz orbital module . Chelomey gained favor with Khruschev by employing members of his family . </P> <P> Korolev 's lunar landing program was designated N1 / L3 , for its N1 super rocket and a more advanced Soyuz 7K - L3 spacecraft , also known as the lunar orbital module ( `` Lunniy Orbitalny Korabl '' , LOK ) , with a crew of two . A separate lunar lander ( `` Lunniy Korabl '' , LK ) , would carry a single cosmonaut to the lunar surface . </P> <P> The N1 / L3 launch vehicle had three stages to Earth orbit , a fourth stage for Earth departure , and a fifth stage for lunar landing assist . The combined space vehicle was roughly the same height and takeoff mass as the three - stage US Apollo / Saturn V and exceeded its takeoff thrust by 28 % , but had only roughly half the translunar injection payload capability . </P> <P> Following Khruschev 's ouster from power , Chelomey 's Zond program was merged into the N1 / L3 program . </P> <H2> Outer space Treaty ( edit ) </H2> <P> The US and USSR began discussions on the peaceful uses of space as early as 1958 , presenting issues for debate to the United Nations , which created a Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space in 1959 . </P> <P> On May 10 , 1962 , Vice President Johnson addressed the Second National Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Space revealing that the United States and the USSR both supported a resolution passed by the Political Committee of the UN General Assembly on December 1962 , which not only urged member nations to `` extend the rules of international law to outer space , '' but to also cooperate in its exploration . Following the passing of this resolution , Kennedy commenced his communications proposing a cooperative American / Soviet space program . </P> <P> The UN ultimately created a Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space , including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies , which was signed by the United States , USSR , and the United Kingdom on January 27 , 1967 , and went into force the following October 10 . </P> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> Wikisource has original text related to this article : Outer Space Treaty of 1967 </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> This treaty : </P> <Ul> <Li> bars party States from placing weapons of mass destruction in Earth orbit , on the Moon , or any other celestial body ; </Li> <Li> exclusively limits the use of the Moon and other celestial bodies to peaceful purposes , and expressly prohibits their use for testing weapons of any kind , conducting military maneuvers , or establishing military bases , installations , and fortifications ; </Li> <Li> declares that the exploration of outer space shall be done to benefit all countries and shall be free for exploration and use by all the States ; </Li> <Li> explicitly forbids any government from claiming a celestial resource such as the Moon or a planet , claiming that they are the common heritage of mankind , `` not subject to national appropriation by claim of sovereignty , by means of use or occupation , or by any other means '' . However , the State that launches a space object retains jurisdiction and control over that object ; </Li> <Li> holds any State liable for damages caused by their space object ; </Li> <Li> declares that `` the activities of non-governmental entities in outer space , including the Moon and other celestial bodies , shall require authorization and continuing supervision by the appropriate State Party to the Treaty '' , and `` States Parties shall bear international responsibility for national space activities whether carried out by governmental or non-governmental entities '' ; and </Li> <Li> `` A State Party to the Treaty which has reason to believe that an activity or experiment planned by another State Party in outer space , including the Moon and other celestial bodies , would cause potentially harmful interference with activities in the peaceful exploration and use of outer space , including the Moon and other celestial bodies , may request consultation concerning the activity or experiment . '' </Li> </Ul> <P> The treaty remains in force , signed by 107 member states . -- As of July 2017 </P> <H2> Disaster strikes both sides ( edit ) </H2> <P> In 1967 , both nations faced serious challenges that brought their programs to temporary halts . Both had been rushing at full - speed toward the first piloted flights of Apollo and Soyuz , without paying due diligence to growing design and manufacturing problems . The results proved fatal to both pioneering crews . </P> Charred interior of the Apollo 1 spacecraft after the fire that killed the first crew <P> On January 27 , 1967 , the same day the US and USSR signed the Outer Space Treaty , the crew of the first crewed Apollo mission , Command Pilot Virgil `` Gus '' Grissom , Senior Pilot Ed White , and Pilot Roger Chaffee , were killed in a fire that swept through their spacecraft cabin during a ground test , less than a month before the planned February 21 launch . An investigative board determined the fire was probably caused by an electrical spark , and quickly grew out of control , fed by the spacecraft 's pure oxygen atmosphere . Crew escape was made impossible by inability to open the plug door hatch cover against the greater - than - atmospheric internal pressure . The board also found design and construction flaws in the spacecraft , and procedural failings , including failure to appreciate the hazard of the pure - oxygen atmosphere , as well as inadequate safety procedures . All these flaws had to be corrected over the next twenty - two months until the first piloted flight could be made . Mercury and Gemini veteran Grissom had been a favored choice of Deke Slayton , NASA 's Director of Flight Crew Operations , to make the first piloted landing . </P> Commemorative plaque and the `` Fallen Astronaut '' sculpture left on the Moon in 1971 by the crew of Apollo 15 in memory of 14 deceased NASA astronauts and USSR cosmonauts <P> On April 24 , 1967 , the single pilot of Soyuz 1 , Vladimir Komarov , became the first in - flight spaceflight fatality . The mission was planned to be a three - day test , to include the first Soviet docking with an unpiloted Soyuz 2 , but the mission was plagued with problems . Early on , Komarov 's craft lacked sufficient electrical power because only one of two solar panels had deployed . Then the automatic attitude control system began malfunctioning and eventually failed completely , resulting in the craft spinning wildly . Komarov was able to stop the spin with the manual system , which was only partially effective . The flight controllers aborted his mission after only one day . During the emergency re-entry , a fault in the landing parachute system caused the primary chute to fail , and the reserve chute became tangled with the drogue chute , causing descent speed to reach as high as 40 m / s ( 140 km / h ; 89 mph ) . Shortly thereafter , Soyuz 1 impacted the ground 3 km ( 1.9 mi ) west of Karabutak , exploding into a ball of flames . The official autopsy states Komarov died of blunt force trauma on impact , and that the subsequent heat mutilation of his corpse was a result of the explosive impact . Fixing the spacecraft 's faults caused an eighteen - month delay before piloted Soyuz flights could resume . </P> <H2> Onward to the Moon ( edit ) </H2> <P> The United States recovered from the Apollo 1 fire , fixing the fatal flaws in an improved version of the Block II command module . The US proceeded with unpiloted test launches of the Saturn V launch vehicle ( Apollo 4 and Apollo 6 ) and the Lunar Module ( Apollo 5 ) during the latter half of 1967 and early 1968 . Apollo 1 's mission to check out the Apollo Command / Service Module in Earth orbit was accomplished by Grissom 's backup crew commanded by Walter Schirra on Apollo 7 , launched on October 11 , 1968 . The eleven - day mission was a total success , as the spacecraft performed a virtually flawless mission , paving the way for the United States to continue with its lunar mission schedule . </P> Artist view of Soyuz 4 and Soyuz 5 after docking <P> The Soviet Union also fixed the parachute and control problems with Soyuz , and the next piloted mission Soyuz 3 was launched on October 26 , 1968 . The goal was to complete Komarov 's rendezvous and docking mission with the un-piloted Soyuz 2 . Ground controllers brought the two craft to within 200 meters ( 660 ft ) of each other , then cosmonaut Georgy Beregovoy took control . He got within 40 meters ( 130 ft ) of his target , but was unable to dock before expending 90 percent of his maneuvering fuel , due to a piloting error that put his spacecraft into the wrong orientation and forced Soyuz 2 to automatically turn away from his approaching craft . The first docking of Soviet spacecraft was finally realized in January 1969 by the Soyuz 4 and Soyuz 5 missions . It was the first - ever docking of two crewed spacecraft , and the first transfer of crew from one space vehicle to another . </P> Soyuz 7K - L1 Zond spacecraft . Artist view <P> The Soviet Zond spacecraft was not yet ready for piloted circumlunar missions in 1968 , after five unsuccessful and partially successful automated test launches : Cosmos 146 on March 10 , 1967 ; Cosmos 154 on April 8 , 1967 ; Zond 1967A September 27 , 1967 ; Zond 1967B on November 22 , 1967 . Zond 4 was launched on March 2 , 1968 , and successfully made a circumlunar flight . After its successful flight around the Moon , Zond 4 encountered problems with its Earth reentry on March 9 , and was ordered destroyed by an explosive charge 15,000 meters ( 49,000 ft ) over the Gulf of Guinea . The Soviet official announcement said that Zond 4 was an automated test flight which ended with its intentional destruction , due to its recovery trajectory positioning it over the Atlantic Ocean instead of over the USSR . </P> Earthrise as seen from Apollo 8 , December 24 , 1968 ( NASA ) <P> During the summer of 1968 , the Apollo program hit another snag : the first pilot - rated Lunar Module ( LM ) was not ready for orbital tests in time for a December 1968 launch . NASA planners overcame this challenge by changing the mission flight order , delaying the first LM flight until March 1969 , and sending Apollo 8 into lunar orbit without the LM in December . This mission was in part motivated by intelligence rumors the Soviet Union might be ready for a piloted Zond flight during late 1968 . In September 1968 , Zond 5 made a circumlunar flight with tortoises on board and returned to Earth , accomplishing the first successful water landing of the Soviet space program in the Indian Ocean . It also scared NASA planners , as it took them several days to figure out that it was only an automated flight , not piloted , because voice recordings were transmitted from the craft en route to the Moon . On November 10 , 1968 , another automated test flight , Zond 6 was launched , but this time encountered difficulties in its Earth reentry , and depressurized and deployed its parachute too early , causing it to crash - land only 16 kilometers ( 9.9 mi ) from where it had been launched six days earlier . It turned out there was no chance of a piloted Soviet circumlunar flight during 1968 , due to the unreliability of the Zonds . </P> The Lunar Module flew in lunar orbit on Apollo 10 , May 22 -- 23 , 1969 <P> On December 21 , 1968 , Frank Borman , James Lovell , and William Anders became the first humans to ride the Saturn V rocket into space on Apollo 8 . They also became the first to leave low - Earth orbit and go to another celestial body , and entered lunar orbit on December 24 . They made ten orbits in twenty hours , and transmitted one of the most watched TV broadcasts in history , with their Christmas Eve program from lunar orbit , that concluded with a reading from the biblical Book of Genesis . Two and a half hours after the broadcast , they fired their engine to perform the first trans - Earth injection to leave lunar orbit and return to the Earth . Apollo 8 safely landed in the Pacific Ocean on December 27 , in NASA 's first dawn splashdown and recovery . </P> <P> The American Lunar Module was finally ready for a successful piloted test flight in low Earth orbit on Apollo 9 in March 1969 . The next mission , Apollo 10 , conducted a `` dress rehearsal '' for the first landing in May 1969 , flying the LM in lunar orbit as close as 47,400 feet ( 14.4 km ) above the surface , the point where the powered descent to the surface would begin . With the LM proven to work well , the next step was to attempt the landing . </P> <P> Unknown to the Americans , the Soviet Moon program was in deep trouble . After two successive launch failures of the N1 rocket in 1969 , Soviet plans for a piloted landing suffered delay . The launch pad explosion of the N - 1 on July 3 , 1969 , was a significant setback . The rocket hit the pad after an engine shutdown , destroying itself and the launch facility . Without the N - 1 rocket , the USSR could not send a large enough payload to the Moon to land a human and return him safely . </P> <H2> Apollo 11 ( edit ) </H2> Main article : Apollo 11 American Buzz Aldrin during the first Moon walk in 1969 <P> Apollo 11 was prepared with the goal of a July landing in the Sea of Tranquility . The crew , selected in January 1969 , consisted of commander ( CDR ) Neil Armstrong , Command Module Pilot ( CMP ) Michael Collins , and Lunar Module Pilot ( LMP ) Edwin `` Buzz '' Aldrin . They trained for the mission until just before the launch day . On July 16 , 1969 , at exactly 9 : 32 am EDT , the Saturn V rocket , AS - 506 , lifted off from Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39 in Florida . </P> <P> The trip to the Moon took just over three days . After achieving orbit , Armstrong and Aldrin transferred into the Lunar Module , named Eagle , and after a landing gear inspection by Collins remaining in the Command / Service Module Columbia , began their descent . After overcoming several computer overload alarms caused by an antenna switch left in the wrong position , and a slight downrange error , Armstrong took over manual flight control at about 180 meters ( 590 ft ) , and guided the Lunar Module to a safe landing spot at 20 : 18 : 04 UTC , July 20 , 1969 ( 3 : 17 : 04 pm CDT ) . The first humans on the Moon waited six hours before they left their craft . At 02 : 56 UTC , July 21 ( 9 : 56 pm CDT July 20 ) , Armstrong became the first human to set foot on the Moon . </P> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> Neil Armstrong 's historic first words on the Moon . `` That 's one small step for ( a ) man , one giant leap for mankind .

His first words when he stepped off the LM 's landing footpad were , `` That 's one small step for ( a ) man , one giant leap for mankind . '' Aldrin joined him on the surface almost 20 minutes later . Altogether , they spent just under two and one - quarter hours outside their craft . The next day , they performed the first launch from another celestial body , and rendezvoused back with Columbia . </P> <P> Apollo 11 left lunar orbit and returned to Earth , landing safely in the Pacific Ocean on July 24 , 1969 . When the spacecraft splashed down , 2,982 days had passed since Kennedy 's commitment to landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth before the end of the decade ; the mission was completed with 161 days to spare . With the safe completion of the Apollo 11 mission , the Americans won the race to the Moon . </P> <H2> The Race winds down ( edit ) </H2> Apollo 17 's Saturn V in 1972 Moonwalk , December 13 , 1972 <P> NASA had ambitious follow - on human spaceflight plans as it reached its lunar goal , but soon discovered it had expended most of its political capital to do so . </P> <P> The first landing was followed by another , precision landing on Apollo 12 in November 1969 . NASA had achieved its first landing goal with enough Apollo spacecraft and Saturn V launchers left for eight follow - on lunar landings through Apollo 20 , conducting extended - endurance missions and transporting the landing crews in Lunar Roving Vehicles on the last five . They also planned an Apollo Applications Program to develop a longer - duration Earth orbital workshop ( later named Skylab ) to be constructed in orbit from a spent S - IVB upper stage , using several launches of the smaller Saturn IB launch vehicle . But planners soon decided this could be done more efficiently by using the two live stages of a Saturn V to launch the workshop pre-fabricated from an S - IVB ( which was also the Saturn V third stage ) , which immediately removed Apollo 20 . Belt - tightening budget cuts soon led NASA to cut Apollo 18 and 19 as well , but keep three extended / Lunar Rover missions . Apollo 13 encountered an in - flight spacecraft failure and had to abort its lunar landing in April 1970 , returning its crew safely but temporarily grounding the program again . It resumed with four successful landings on Apollo 14 ( February 1971 ) , Apollo 15 ( July 1971 ) , Apollo 16 ( April 1972 ) , and Apollo 17 ( December 1972 ) . </P> <P> In February 1969 , President Richard M. Nixon convened a Space Task Group to set recommendations for the future US civilian space program , headed by his Vice President Spiro T. Agnew . Agnew was an enthusiastic proponent of NASA 's follow - on plans , and the STG recommended plans to develop a reusable Space Transportation System including a Space Shuttle , which would facilitate development of permanent space stations in Earth and lunar orbit , perhaps a base on the lunar surface , and the first human flight to Mars as early as 1986 or as late as 2000 . Nixon had a better sense of the declining political support in Congress for a new Apollo - style program , which had disappeared with the achievement of the landing , and he intended to pursue detente with the USSR and China , which he hoped might ease Cold War tensions . He cut the spending proposal he sent to Congress to include funding for only the Space Shuttle , with perhaps an option to pursue the Earth orbital space station for the foreseeable future . </P> <P> The USSR continued trying to perfect their N1 rocket , finally canceling it in 1976 , after two more launch failures in 1971 and 1972 . </P> <H3> Salyuts and Skylab ( edit ) </H3> The Soyuz 11 crew with the Salyut station in the background , in a Soviet commemorative stamp <P> Having lost the race to the Moon , the USSR decided to concentrate on orbital space stations . During 1969 and 1970 , they launched six more Soyuz flights after Soyuz 3 , then launched the first space station , the Salyut 1 laboratory designed by Kerim Kerimov , on April 19 , 1971 . Three days later , the Soyuz 10 crew attempted to dock with it , but failed to achieve a secure enough connection to safely enter the station . The Soyuz 11 crew of Vladislav Volkov , Georgi Dobrovolski and Viktor Patsayev successfully docked on June 7 , and completed a record 22 - day stay . The crew became the second in - flight space fatality during their reentry on June 30 . They were asphyxiated when their spacecraft 's cabin lost all pressure , shortly after undocking . The disaster was blamed on a faulty cabin pressure valve , that allowed all the air to vent into space . The crew was not wearing pressure suits and had no chance of survival once the leak occurred . </P> <P> Salyut 1 's orbit was increased to prevent premature reentry , but further piloted flights were delayed while the Soyuz was redesigned to fix the new safety problem . The station re-entered the Earth 's atmosphere on October 11 , after 175 days in orbit . The USSR attempted to launch a second Salyut - class station designated Durable Orbital Station - 2 ( DOS - 2 ) on July 29 , 1972 , but a rocket failure caused it to fail to achieve orbit . After the DOS - 2 failure , the USSR attempted to launch four more Salyut - class stations up to 1975 , with another failure due to an explosion of the final rocket stage , which punctured the station with shrapnel so that it would not hold pressure . All of the Salyuts were presented to the public as non-military scientific laboratories , but some of them were covers for the military Almaz reconnaissance stations . </P> <P> The United States launched the orbital workstation Skylab 1 on May 14 , 1973 . It weighed 169,950 pounds ( 77,090 kg ) , was 58 feet ( 18 m ) long by 21.7 feet ( 6.6 m ) in diameter , with a habitable volume of 10,000 cubic feet ( 280 m ) . Skylab was damaged during the ascent to orbit , losing one of its solar panels and a meteoroid thermal shield . Subsequent crewed missions repaired the station , and the final mission 's crew , Skylab 4 , set the Space Race endurance record with 84 days in orbit when the mission ended on February 8 , 1974 . Skylab stayed in orbit another five years before reentering the Earth 's atmosphere over the Indian Ocean and Western Australia on July 11 , 1979 . </P> <H3> Apollo -- Soyuz test Project ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Apollo - Soyuz Test Project Apollo - Soyuz crew : From left to right : Donald `` Deke '' Slayton , Thomas Patten Stafford , Vance Brand , Alexey Leonov , and Valeri Kubasov <P> In May 1972 , President Richard M. Nixon and Soviet Premier Leonid Brezhnev negotiated an easing of relations known as detente , creating a temporary `` thaw '' in the Cold War . In the spirit of good sportsmanship , the time seemed right for cooperation rather than competition , and the notion of a continuing `` race '' began to subside . </P> <P> The two nations planned a joint mission to dock the last US Apollo craft with a Soyuz , known as the Apollo - Soyuz Test Project ( ASTP ) . To prepare , the US designed a docking module for the Apollo that was compatible with the Soviet docking system , which allowed any of their craft to dock with any other ( e.g. Soyuz / Soyuz as well as Soyuz / Salyut ) . The module was also necessary as an airlock to allow the men to visit each other 's craft , which had incompatible cabin atmospheres . The USSR used the Soyuz 16 mission in December 1974 to prepare for ASTP . </P> <P> The joint mission began when Soyuz 19 was first launched on July 15 , 1975 , at 12 : 20 UTC , and the Apollo craft was launched with the docking module six and a half hours later . The two craft rendezvoused and docked on July 17 at 16 : 19 UTC . The three astronauts conducted joint experiments with the two cosmonauts , and the crew shook hands , exchanged gifts , and visited each other 's craft . </P> <H2> Legacy ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Human spaceflight after Apollo ( edit ) </H3> International Space Station in 2010 <P> In the 1970s , the United States began developing a new generation of reusable orbital spacecraft known as the Space Shuttle , and launched a range of uncrewed probes . The USSR continued to develop space station technology with the Salyut program and Mir ( ' Peace ' or ' World ' , depending on the context ) space station , supported by Soyuz spacecraft . They developed their own large space shuttle under the Buran program . The USSR dissolved in 1991 and the remains of its space program mainly passed to Russia . The United States and Russia worked together in space with the Shuttle -- Mir Program , and again with the International Space Station . </P> <P> The Russian R - 7 rocket family , which launched the first Sputnik at the beginning of the Space Race , is still in use today . It services the International Space Station ( ISS ) as the launcher for both the Soyuz and Progress spacecraft . It also ferries both Russian and American crews to and from the station . </P> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Space portal </Li> <Li> Spaceflight portal </Li> <Li> Robotics portal </Li> <Li> Cold War portal </Li> </Ul> <Ul> <Li> Cold War playground equipment </Li> <Li> Comparison of Asian national space programs -- a so - called `` Asian space race '' </Li> <Li> History of spaceflight </Li> <Li> List of space exploration milestones , 1957 -- 1969 </Li> <Li> Moon Landing </Li> <Li> Moon Shot </Li> <Li> Space advocacy </Li> <Li> Space exploration </Li> <Li> Space policy </Li> <Li> Space propaganda </Li> <Li> Spaceflight records </Li> <Li> Timeline of Solar System exploration </Li> <Li> Timeline of space exploration </Li> <Li> Timeline of the Space Race </Li> <Li> Woods Hole Conference </Li> <Li> Mars race </Li> </Ul> <H2> Notes ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ Neufeld , Michael J ( 1995 ) .
