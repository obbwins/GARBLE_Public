According to Ovid , he was born a remarkably handsome boy with whom the water nymph Salmacis fell in love and prayed to be united forever . A god , in answer to her prayer , merged their two forms into one and transformed them into an androgynous form . His name is compounded of his parents ' names , Hermes and Aphrodite . He was one of the Erotes . </P> <P> Because he was a son of Hermes , and consequently a great - grandson of Atlas , sometimes he is called Atlantiades ( Greek : \u0391\u03c4\u03bb\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03ac\u03b4\u03b7\u03c2 ) .

The reference to the fourth day of the month is telling : this is the luckiest day to have a wedding . Hermaphroditus 's association with marriage seems to have been that , by embodying both masculine and feminine qualities , he symbolized the coming together of men and women in sacred union . Another factor linking Hermaphroditus to weddings was his parents ' role in protecting and blessing brides . </P> <P> Hermaphroditus 's name is derived from those of his parents Hermes and Aphrodite . All three of these gods figure largely among erotic and fertility figures , and all possess distinctly sexual overtones . Sometimes , Hermaphroditus is referred to as Aphroditus . The phallic god Priapus was the son of Hermes by some accounts and the youthful god of desire Eros of Ares and Aphrodite . </P> <H2> Mythology ( edit ) </H2> Further information : Salmacis and Salmacis ( fountain ) <P> Ovid 's account relates that Hermaphroditus was nursed by naiads in the caves of Mount Ida , a sacred mountain in Phrygia ( present day Turkey ) . At the age of fifteen , he grew bored with his surroundings and traveled to the cities of Lycia and Caria . It was in the woods of Caria , near Halicarnassus ( modern Bodrum , Turkey ) that he encountered the nymph , Salmacis , in her pool . She was overcome by lust for the boy , who was very handsome but still young , and tried to seduce him , but was rejected . When he thought her to be gone , Hermaphroditus undressed and entered the waters of the empty pool . Salmacis sprang out from behind a tree and jumped into the pool . She wrapped herself around the boy , forcibly kissing him and touching his breast . While he struggled , she called out to the gods that they should never part . Her wish was granted , and their bodies blended into one form , `` a creature of both sexes '' . Hermaphroditus prayed to Hermes and Aphrodite that anyone else who bathed in the pool would be similarly transformed , and his wish was granted . `` In this form the story was certainly not ancient , '' Karl Kerenyi noted . He compared the myth of the beautiful ephebe with Narcissus and Hyacinthus , who had an archaic hero - cult , and Hymenaios . </P> <P> Diodorus Siculus in his work Library of History mention , that some say that Hermaphroditus is a god and appears at certain times among men , but there are some who declare that such creatures of two sexes are monstrosities , and coming rarely into the world as they do have the quality of presaging the future , sometimes for evil and sometimes for good . </P> <H2> Cult and worship ( edit ) </H2> Main article : Aphroditus <P> The oldest traces of the cult in Greek countries are found in Cyprus . Here , according to Macrobius ( Saturnalia , iii. 8 ) , there was a bearded statue of a male Aphrodite , called Aphroditos by Aristophanes . Philochorus in his Atthis ( ap . Macrobius loc . cit . ) further identified this divinity , at whose sacrifices men and women exchanged garments , with the Moon . A terracotta plaque from the 7th century BC depicting Aphroditos was found in Perachora , which suggests it was an archaic cult . </P> <P> The deification and the origins of the cult of hermaphrodite beings stem from Eastern religions , where the hermaphrodite nature expressed the idea of a primitive being that united both genders . This double sex also attributed to Dionysus and Priapus - the union in one being of the two principles of generation and conception - denotes extensive fertilizing and productive powers . </P> <P> This Cyprian Aphrodite is the same as the later Hermaphroditos , which simply means Aphroditos in the form of a herm ( see Hermae ) , and first occurs in the Characters ( 16 ) of Theophrastus . After its introduction at Athens ( probably in the 5th century BC ) , the importance of this deity seems to have declined . It appears no longer as the object of a special cult , but limited to the homage of certain sects , expressed by superstitious rites of obscure significance . </P> <P> We find in Alciphron that there was at Athens a temple of Hermaphroditus . The passage proposes that he might be considered as the deity who presided over married people ; the strict union between husband and wife being aptly represented by a deity , who was male and female inseparably blended together . </P> <H2> Literature ( edit ) </H2> <P> The earliest mention of Hermaphroditus in Greek literature is by the philosopher Theophrastus ( 3rd century BC ) , in his book The Characters , XVI The Superstitious Man , in which he portrays various types of eccentric people . </P> <P> The first mention of Hermes and Aphrodite as Hermaphroditus 's parents was by the Greek historian , Diodorus Siculus ( 1st century BC ) , in his book Bibliotheca historica , book IV , 4.6. 5 . </P> <P> Hermaphroditus , as he has been called , who was born of Hermes and Aphrodite and received a name which is a combination of those of both his parents . Some say that this Hermaphroditus is a god and appears at certain times among men , and that he is born with a physical body which is a combination of that of a man and that of a woman , in that he has a body which is beautiful and delicate like that of a woman , but has the masculine quality and vigour of a man . But there are some who declare that such creatures of two sexes are monstrosities , and coming rarely into the world as they do they have the quality of presaging the future , sometimes for evil and sometimes for good . </P> <P> The only full narration of his myth is that of Ovid 's Metamorphoses , IV. 274 - 388 ( 8 AD ) , where the emphasis is on the feminine snares of the lascivious water - nymph Salmacis and her compromising of Hermaphroditus ' erstwhile budding manly strength , detailing his bashfulness and the engrafting of their bodies . </P> <P> A rendering of the story into an epyllion , published anonymously in 1602 , was later ( 1640 ) attributed by some to Francis Beaumont . </P> <P> In the Palatine Anthology , IX. 783 ( 980 AD ) , there is a reference to a sculpture of Hermaphroditus which was placed in a bath for both sexes . The passage IX. 317 is in dialogue form , based on the dialogue between Hermaphroditus and Silenus . The latter claims that he has had sexual intercourse with Hermaphroditus three times . Hermaphroditus complains and objects to the fact by invoking Hermes in an oath , while Silenus invokes Pan for the reliability of his allegations . </P> <P> Algernon Charles Swinburne 's poem `` Hermaphroditus '' in Poems and Ballads is subscribed Au Mus\u00e9e du Louvre , Mars 1863 , leaving no doubt that it was the Borghese Hermaphroditus that had inspired his ode . </P> <H2> In art ( edit ) </H2> Drawing of a relief depicting Hermaphroditus and Eros crowning a herm by Antonio Maria Zanetti ( circa 1721 ) Borghese Hermaphroditus , Roman copy of the 2nd century AD ( Louvre ) .
