After successfully collecting a bone fragment , the team 's survivors barely escape the island following attacks by the Mosasaurus and Tyrannosaurus rex . </P> <P> Three years later in 2018 , a U.S. Senate hearing in Washington , D.C. debates whether Isla Nublar 's dinosaurs should be saved from an impending volcanic eruption . Mathematician Dr. Ian Malcolm testifies that the dinosaurs should be allowed to perish to correct John Hammond 's mistake of cloning them . Meanwhile , Jurassic World 's former operations manager Claire Dearing has established the Dinosaur Protection Group to save the animals . After the Senate rules against rescuing the dinosaurs , Hammond 's former partner , Benjamin Lockwood , summons Claire to his Northern California estate . Lockwood and his aide , Eli Mills , reveal a plan to relocate the dinosaurs to a new island sanctuary . Claire is needed to help reactivate the park 's dinosaur tracking system to locate the animals , particularly Blue , the last living Velociraptor . Although they are estranged , Claire recruits Jurassic World 's former Velociraptor trainer and Blue 's alpha , Owen Grady , to help capture her . </P> <P> On Isla Nublar , Claire and former park technician Franklin Webb get the tracking system online . Owen , paleo - veterinarian Zia Rodriguez , and a mercenary team led by Ken Wheatley search for Blue . Upon finding her , the encounter escalates , resulting in a mercenary shooting Blue and Wheatley tranquilizing Owen . The mercenaries take Zia so she can treat Blue 's injury . Their ship departs for the U.S. mainland as the animals left behind die in the eruption . Claire , Franklin , and Owen sneak aboard in time and assist Zia in transfusing Blue with Tyrannosaurus blood . The group now realize the captured dinosaurs were never being transported to a new island and are for another purpose . </P> <P> Back at the estate , Lockwood 's orphaned pre-teen granddaughter Maisie overhears Mills and auctioneer Gunnar Eversol secretly planning to auction the captured dinosaurs on the black market . They will also unveil the Indoraptor , a new genetically - engineered dinosaur created by geneticist Dr. Henry Wu using Indominus rex and Velociraptor DNA . Wu wants Blue 's DNA to create an enhanced Indoraptor , unaware that Blue 's blood is contaminated . After Maisie informs Lockwood about the auction , he confronts Mills , who murders him . Maisie is later revealed to have been cloned from Lockwood 's deceased daughter and is the reason John Hammond , who opposed human cloning , ended their partnership . </P> <P> The dinosaurs are transported to Lockwood 's estate and caged . Zia and Franklin evade capture , but Owen and Claire are apprehended and confined . Owen incites a Stygimoloch into breaking open their cell . They find Maisie who leads them to the auction where the Indoraptor is being sold despite Wu 's protests that it is a prototype . Owen disrupts the proceedings by luring the Stygimoloch into the room . In the ensuing chaos , Wheatley tranquilizes the Indoraptor to extract a tooth as a trophy , but it feigns sedation and escapes , killing him , Eversol , and others . The Indoraptor hunts Owen , Claire , and Maisie throughout the mansion . Zia releases Blue , who attacks the Indoraptor , causing it to fall through a glass roof to its death . </P> <P> When a hydrogen cyanide gas leak threatens the caged animals , Maisie is unable to let them die and frees them despite Owen 's warning . Mills is killed and the Indominus bone destroyed by the Tyrannosaurus . Owen , Claire , Maisie , Zia , and Franklin safely get away , while Blue and the other dinosaurs escape . </P> <P> In a new U.S. Senate hearing , Dr. Malcolm declares the beginning of a Neo-Jurassic Age where humans and dinosaurs must learn to coexist . The closing scenes show the freed dinosaurs roaming wilderness and outer urban areas . </P> <H2> Cast </H2> Main article : List of Jurassic Park characters <Ul> <Li> Chris Pratt as Owen Grady : A Navy veteran and former Velociraptor handler for Jurassic World . </Li> <Li> Bryce Dallas Howard as Claire Dearing : Jurassic World 's former operations manager , now a dinosaur - rights activist , who has founded the Dinosaur Protection Group at San Francisco to save the surviving dinosaurs from Isla Nublar . </Li> <Li> Rafe Spall as Eli Mills : Lockwood 's ambitious assistant who recruits Owen and Claire to rescue the dinosaurs . Speaking of his character 's actions over the course of the film , Spall noted that , `` Ambition is such a powerful emotion , you can get wrapped up in it and end up doing things in order to succeed . This character believes he is doing right . He has been entrusted with pushing Lockwood 's fortune into the future and making it survive after he dies . Mills feels he is simply doing what he was asked to do . '' </Li> <Li> Justice Smith as Franklin Webb : A former IT technician for Jurassic World who is now the Dinosaur Protection Group 's systems analyst and hacker . </Li> <Li> Daniella Pineda as Zia Rodriguez : A former Marine who is now the Dinosaur Protection Group 's paleoveterinarian . </Li> <Li> James Cromwell as Sir Benjamin Lockwood : John Hammond 's former partner in developing the technology to clone dinosaurs . </Li> <Li> Toby Jones as Gunnar Eversol : An auctioneer host at Lockwood Estate who sells the Isla Nublar dinosaurs for profit . In an interview , Jones likened his character to that of `` a rogue arms dealer ; he sees profits in selling these creatures as weapons . He is totally morally neutral about whatever he is selling . He is only interested in whether or not it will make him a profit . '' </Li> <Li> Ted Levine as Ken Wheatley : A seasoned mercenary who commands the rescue operation on Isla Nublar . </Li> <Li> B.D. Wong as Henry Wu : The former head geneticist of both Jurassic World and the original Jurassic Park . Speaking of his character 's actions , Wong stated : `` I do think he 's motivated by his love for science and his own ego , which is well supported by his massive achievements ... I think he turns a blind eye to the human suffering that comes as a result because he thinks he 's looking at some bigger picture . '' </Li> <Li> Isabella Sermon as Maisie Lockwood : Lockwood 's juvenile granddaughter and legal ward following her parents ' deaths . </Li> <Li> Geraldine Chaplin as Iris : The Lockwood Estate housekeeper , Maisie 's nanny , and protector of the Lockwood family 's secrets . </Li> <Li> Jeff Goldblum as Ian Malcolm : An expert in chaos theory who once consulted for InGen 's Jurassic Park . In a podcast interview , Goldblum revealed of his role `` It 's small ... who knows , they may cut me out entirely ! But if I stay in , I 'll be a sprig of parsley or a little garnish , hopefully with some impact ! '' Director Bayona confirmed that Goldblum 's role is simply a cameo , stating , `` He does n't have a major role in the action but it 's definitely a very meaningful one in terms of the story . '' </Li> <Li> Peter Jason as Senator Sherwood : A Senator who is among those who debate about saving the dinosaurs on Isla Nublar . </Li> </Ul> <H2> Production </H2> <H3> Development </H3> <P> During early conversations on the 2015 film Jurassic World , executive producer Steven Spielberg told director Colin Trevorrow that he was interested in having several more films made . In April 2014 , Trevorrow announced that sequels had been discussed : `` We wanted to create something that would be a little bit less arbitrary and episodic , and something that could potentially arc into a series that would feel like a complete story . '' Trevorrow said Chris Pratt and Omar Sy might reprise their roles for the next few films and said he would direct the film if asked . Trevorrow later told Spielberg that he would only focus on directing one film in the series . In May 2015 , Trevorrow announced that he would not direct another film in the series : `` I would be involved in some way , but not as director . '' Trevorrow felt that different directors could bring different qualities to future films . Pratt had been signed for future films in the series , as was Ty Simpkins , who portrayed Gray in Jurassic World . </P> <P> On June 3 , 2015 , Trevorrow stated that Jurassic World left many story possibilities open : `` I really like the idea that this group of geneticists are n't the only people who can make a dinosaur ( ... ) when you think of the differences between Apple and PC -- the minute something goes open - source , there are all kinds of entities and interests that may be able to utilize that technology . '' On June 8 , 2015 , Jurassic World producer Frank Marshall met with Trevorrow and Universal Pictures to discuss a sequel . Later that month , Trevorrow did not deny that the film could involve `` dinosaur soldiers '' and said the series is `` not always gon na be about a Jurassic Park '' , saying he felt that future films could explore the idea of dinosaurs and humans co-existing . Trevorrow also hinted that the next film may not involve the Jurassic World theme park and said he would be interested in seeing a Jurassic Park film made by one of several Spanish horror film directors , whose names he did not mention . </P> <H3> Pre-production </H3> <P> On July 23 , 2015 , Universal announced that a fifth film had been scheduled for a June 22 , 2018 , release date in the U.S. It was also announced that Trevorrow would write the script with his writing partner Derek Connolly , as they did for Jurassic World ; that the film would be produced by Frank Marshall ; and that Spielberg and Trevorrow would act as executive producers . Universal also said that Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard would reprise their roles from the previous film . At the time of the film 's announcement , Trevorrow said the series `` is n't always going to be limited to theme parks '' and confirmed that the film would not involve `` a bunch of dinosaurs chasing people on an island '' stating , `` That 'll get old real fast . '' Trevorrow also spoke of the film 's possible open - source storyline : `` It 's almost like InGen is Mac , but what if PC gets their hands on it ? What if there are 15 different entities around the world who can make a dinosaur ? '' </P> <P> In August 2015 , Howard said that the script was being written , and it was announced that the film would be released in the UK two weeks early , on June 7 , 2018 . Later that year , B.D. Wong said he `` would be happy to return '' as Dr. Henry Wu , while Howard announced that filming would begin in 2017 . Howard also said she would be interested in seeing characters from earlier Jurassic Park films return for the fifth film , saying , `` I could see versions of the film where a lot of the characters come back . '' By October 2015 , director J.A. Bayona was being considered to direct the film , although he chose instead to direct the World War Z sequel , a project to which he had already signed on . In January 2016 , it was reported that Bayona could still be a candidate to direct the film after he dropped out of the World War Z sequel due to other commitments . </P> <P> In March 2016 , London was being scouted as a possible filming location and setting for the film , and it was subsequently announced that filming would take place at a UK studio . On April 14 , 2016 , actor Jeff Goldblum said he had no plans to appear in the film as his character Ian Malcolm , although he said he was open to the possibility . On April 18 , 2016 , Bayona was announced as the film 's director , with Bel\u00e9n Atienza and Patrick Crowley joining Marshall as producers . Spielberg , Marshall , and Kathleen Kennedy had been impressed by Bayona 's 2012 film , The Impossible , and initially considered having him direct Jurassic World , but he declined as he felt there was not enough time for production . Trevorrow wanted Bayona to direct the film after seeing his 2007 horror film , The Orphanage . Before Bayona was hired , he met with Trevorrow and became enthused with the project after being shown the script 's second half , which would play out like a haunted house film . After Bayona was hired , Trevorrow said about the film , `` We 're moving it into new territory . J.A. Bayona is an incredible director and I know he 'll push the boundaries of what a ' Jurassic ' movie is . I think it 's important that we take risks . A franchise must evolve or perish . '' Trevorrow and Bayona worked closely throughout the film 's production . In June 2016 , actor Sam Neill was asked if he would return to the series as Dr. Alan Grant and responded , `` You never say never , but I think it 's moved on . It 's different times . '' </P> <P> The film , under the working title of Ancient Futures , was in full pre-production as of July 2016 , with storyboards being designed . Andy Nicholson was hired as the film 's production designer and spent four weeks with Bayona in Barcelona , discussing reference pictures and background details , as well as Bayona 's ideas for the Lockwood mansion . Production was scheduled to begin in Hawaii in February 2017 . Wales was also confirmed as a filming location , including Brecon Beacons and Penbryn . Trevorrow stated that Hawaii would be used as a primary filming location , while U.K. shooting would be limited to studios , without the story taking place there . Trevorrow also said that the film would feature many dinosaurs that were not seen in previous films and denied that the film 's story would involve militarized dinosaurs , which would only be mentioned in the film . </P> <P> For the film 's second half in which dinosaurs are transported by boat to the mainland , Ecuador and Peru had both been scouted as possible filming locations and settings , while Marshall thought that Cabo San Lucas would be ideal , but such locations ultimately did not work for the film 's story . Although the film was partially shot in England , Spielberg felt that the country was too far from the fictional Isla Nublar to be used as the in - film setting during the second half , as he and the producers did not want the film to focus too much time on a boat . Crowley stated , `` Rather than making it a movie about traveling on a boat , which is not very exciting , you needed to get to the place . '' </P> <P> In September 2016 , Bayona confirmed that the film would be the second chapter in a planned Jurassic World trilogy . Later that year , Marshall said that Wong was `` probably going to come back , '' while Jurassic World composer Michael Giacchino confirmed that he would return to compose the fifth film . \u00d3scar Faura was announced as the film 's cinematographer at the end of the year . </P> <H3> Writing </H3> <P> Although Spielberg was heavily involved in the development of ideas for Jurassic World , he had Trevorrow and Connolly devise their own ideas for the sequel , while retaining final approval on the project . In June 2015 , approximately two weeks after the theatrical release of Jurassic World , Trevorrow embarked on a road trip from Los Angeles back to his home state of Vermont . Connolly agreed to accompany Trevorrow on the trip so they could discuss a basic set of ideas that Trevorrow had for the film . During their eight - day trip , the writers began work on the script and devised the basic story . Trevorrow said the film 's story was inspired by a quote from Dr. Alan Grant in the first film : `` Dinosaurs and man , two species separated by 65 million years of evolution , have suddenly been thrown back into the mix together . How can we possibly have the slightest idea of what to expect ? '' Trevorrow also said that the story was heavily inspired by the idea that , `` A mistake made a long time ago just ca n't be undone . '' </P> <P> The film is also based on concepts from Michael Crichton 's novel Jurassic Park ( 1990 ) and its sequel The Lost World ( 1995 ) , and includes dialogue from the first novel . Isla Nublar 's volcano was an idea that existed in the first novel , and the writers chose to incorporate the idea into the film 's plot . Trevorrow compared the destruction of Isla Nublar to `` the burning down of a church or a temple , '' stating , `` I honestly think it 's like killing off a character in a way , and if you 're going to do that , as long as you approach it with the proper respect and acknowledgement that you understand how indelible and permanent what you 're doing is , then hopefully people will have an emotional response but they wo n't hate you for it . '' The idea to include a `` silent partner '' of John Hammond was also inspired by the Jurassic Park novel . Although the character of Benjamin Lockwood was not featured in the novel , the book depicts the early years leading up to the cloning of dinosaurs , which made Trevorrow realize that there would have been many people involved in such a project , convincing him that someone like Lockwood would be among those people . </P> <P> In his initial film treatment , Trevorrow had included story elements that Marshall and Crowley considered excessive for a single film , as the producers felt it was also important to include details about Owen and Claire 's lives after the events of Jurassic World . Although the original ending was the same as the final film , Trevorrow had wanted to include more details about the integration of dinosaurs into the world , before choosing to remove such details to keep the story focused . For the script 's structure , Trevorrow said he had been inspired by Spielberg 's 2015 film Bridge of Spies , in which two seemingly unrelated stories `` collide in the middle , and move on together . '' Trevorrow was also inspired by the 1975 film Three Days of the Condor , stating , `` It 's one of those places where you think you know what the score is , and then everything changes , and then suddenly you do n't know who to trust . '' Having directed Jurassic World , Trevorrow became familiar with how animatronics worked and wrote scenes into the sequel in a way that would allow for their use , as animatronics are incapable of certain actions such as running . </P> <P> Regarding the idea of human cloning , Trevorrow stated that `` we 're so much closer to cloning humans than we are to cloning dinosaurs . It felt like far less of a leap to me than dinosaurs do . ( ... ) To have a character who has such deep love and has felt such loss and the inability to go on , I think is something we all feel . So the idea that you might be able to bring someone back in that way is emotionally grounded in a very universal idea . '' Trevorrow also stated that he was interested in `` the larger impact '' of genetic power , including its emotional impact and its potential human impact , while further stating `` we knew that we did n't want to continue to make movies about the dangers of messing with science . We want to tell a story about where we are now , which is that we have messed with science , we have fundamentally altered our world and now we 're dealing with the consequences . '' Trevorrow was nervous about how audiences would react to the story 's human cloning aspect , an idea that was supported by Spielberg , who was excited about the questions that such an idea could raise in the film 's sequel . Because of criticism regarding the death of Zara in the previous film , Trevorrow stated that for Jurassic World : Fallen Kingdom , `` We made sure that every death was earned . Everybody deserves their death in this movie , a lesson learned . In 2018 everyone earns it . Horrible people . '' </P> <P> After Bayona was hired , he began reading all of Crichton 's novels -- including Jurassic Park and The Lost World -- for inspiration and `` to try to immerse myself in Crichton 's mind . '' Trevorrow and Connolly began working with Bayona in July 2016 , to perfect the script to the director 's liking . Trevorrow stated that the film would be more `` suspenseful and scary '' than its predecessor : `` It 's just the way it 's designed ; it 's the way the story plays out . I knew I wanted Bayona to direct it long before anyone ever heard that it was a possibility , so the whole thing was just built around his skillset . '' Trevorrow later described the film as `` The Impossible meets The Orphanage with dinosaurs . '' Bayona stated that with the first half of the film set on an island , `` you have what you expect from a Jurassic movie , '' while the second half `` moves to a totally different environment that feels more suspenseful , darker , claustrophobic , and even has this kind of gothic element , which I love . '' Bayona 's concept of gothic suspense for the film was influenced by Alfred Hitchcock films , and he compared the film to The Empire Strikes Back and Star Trek II : The Wrath of Khan , which were both considered darker than their predecessors . </P> <P> Trevorrow said the film 's dinosaurs would be `` a parable of the treatment animals receive today : the abuse , medical experimentation , pets , having wild animals in zoos like prisons , the use the military has made of them , animals as weapons . '' The idea of weaponized dinosaurs came from Spielberg . Trevorrow said that with the film 's dinosaur auction , `` The worst instincts of mankind are revealed . The first film was very clearly about corporate greed . This is just about human greed . '' The film includes ideas previously featured in a rejected 2004 draft for Jurassic Park IV ( later Jurassic World ) , presented in the same structure : a return to Isla Nublar followed by a second half set in a large Gothic building on the mainland . The idea of a dinosaur auction was also present in the rejected draft , which Trevorrow had read while writing the first Jurassic World film . </P> <P> Bayona had his own ideas incorporated into the script while essentially retaining the same original story devised by Trevorrow and Connolly . The film 's underwater opening sequence was already in Trevorrow and Connolly 's script , and Bayona asked Trevorrow to push for it to become a bigger scene with a larger set . Among Trevorrow 's ideas was to include Jeff Goldblum 's character of Ian Malcolm , who appeared in the franchise 's earlier films . Trevorrow and Goldblum discussed dialogue ideas for Malcolm , and Trevorrow stated that he used a lot of dialogue from Crichton 's Jurassic Park novel for the character . Marshall stated that Trevorrow wrote Malcolm as `` the ' Uh oh , danger , I told you so ' kind of character , '' and Trevorrow said about the character , `` I saw him as kind of Al Gore . He 's got a beard now , and he 's like , ' I told all of you this was going to be a disaster , and sure enough it is . ' '' Bayona and Trevorrow ultimately removed certain moments from the script that they felt would be better for the sequel , which was expected to depict dinosaurs having spread around the world . </P> <H3> Casting </H3> <P> In October 2016 , casting was underway for the role of a nine - year - old girl . Approximately 2,500 girls were interviewed for the role , which ultimately went to Isabella Sermon , marking her film debut . By November 2016 , Tom Holland -- who previously starred in The Impossible -- had discussed having a possible role in the film , but he did not believe he would be available for filming because of scheduling conflicts . Toby Jones , Rafe Spall , and Justice Smith were cast at the end of the year . </P> <P> Daniella Pineda , Ted Levine and James Cromwell were cast in early 2017 , while Wong confirmed his return as Dr. Henry Wu . To maintain secrecy , the Ancient Futures title was used in the casting phase . During auditions , references to dinosaurs were replaced with animals such as lions and grizzly bears . To convince the studio that Pineda was right for the role of Zia , Bayona had her demonstrate that she could perform comedy and drama scenes , as well as improvisation . Pineda auditioned a total of seven times before receiving the role . She auditioned for Bayona , Atienza , and Crowley , and did not meet the cast until she arrived in England for filming . </P> <P> In March 2017 , Bayona announced that Geraldine Chaplin , who had roles in each of his previous films , had joined the cast . The next month , it was announced that Jeff Goldblum would be reprising his role as Dr. Ian Malcolm from the first two films . Bayona considered Malcolm a `` great character ! '' while Marshall said , `` The world has changed a lot since Ian Malcolm went to Jurassic Park and we need his point of view now more than ever . He told us about chaos theory , he was right . '' </P> <H3> Filming </H3> <P> Filming began at Langley Business Centre in Slough , England , on February 23 , 2017 . Scenes shot at the business center included Claire 's Dinosaur Protection Group office , Owen training his baby raptors , and Owen and Claire attempting to retrieve blood from the sedated T. rex . A majority of filming in England took place at Pinewood Studios . Because of its large sound stages , Pinewood Studios was considered perfect for the film 's many interior scenes . After filming concluded in England , production moved to Hawaii , which was used as a primary filming location . Scenes shot in Hawaii were set on Isla Nublar , the fictional island featured in the first and fourth films . Scenes were also expected to be shot at Brecon Beacons National Park in Wales . The film was shot in CinemaScope , and is the first entry in the Jurassic Park series that is presented in a 2.40 : 1 aspect ratio . The film crew used Arri Alexa 65 cameras throughout the duration of filming . Several scenes were shot to reference various films including From Here to Eternity ( 1953 ) and Dracula ( 1979 ) , as well as Spielberg 's films Raiders of the Lost Ark ( 1981 ) and E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial ( 1982 ) . Spielberg was shown scenes from the film during production and he offered his opinions to Bayona . </P> <P> During filming and in between takes , Bayona used an iPod to play different types of music on set to inspire the actors during certain scenes , as he had done for his previous films . Bayona also played sound effects from previous films in the series , including a T. rex roar that he sometimes used to get a natural reaction from the actors . In particular , Bayona played unexpected sounds and loud music to scare Smith for certain scenes , as his character is portrayed as easily frightened . Prior to being filmed , Bayona and Pratt discussed each scene involving the character of Owen , and many of Pratt 's ideas were added into the film . Speaking about Levine 's character , Bayona said , `` He came with this idea of creating this kind of military man . He just wanted to portray the most hateable character possible . ( ... ) And he was so creative on set , trying to give ideas , bringing story notes to make this character more and more hateable . '' The film includes several indirect references to U.S. president Donald Trump , including an idea from Trevorrow in which a news ticker states that the `` U.S. president '' has questioned the `` existence of dinosaurs in the first place . '' Jones was allowed to decide his character 's appearance , which included a wig similar to Trump 's hairstyle . An unscripted moment that was left in the film involves Levine 's character referring to Pineda 's character Zia as a `` nasty woman '' , a line that was previously made famous by Trump . </P> <P> In April 2017 , scenes were filmed at East Berkshire College in Berkshire , England , and at Loch Long in Argyll and Bute , Scotland . Also that month , filming took place at Hartland Park -- formerly the Pyestock jet engine test site -- in Fleet , Hampshire , England , where the film 's opening sequence was shot . The scene was filmed through the night and involved helicopters , rain machines , and lightning simulators to depict a thunderstorm . Bayona described the opening scene as a `` massive action piece '' that resembled the prologues used in James Bond films . Scenes were filmed on sets at Hawley Common , also in Hampshire , where the exterior of Lockwood 's mansion was built , as well as a mainland loading dock where the dinosaurs are brought . The exterior of the ship that transports Isla Nublar 's dinosaurs to the mainland was created entirely through computer - generated effects by Industrial Light & Magic ( ILM ) , which worked on the previous films . The ship 's interior was constructed by Nicholson and his team as a large set at Pinewood Studios , and after filming , the set was rebuilt to depict the large rooftop of the Lockwood Estate . The exterior of the Cragside country house in Northumberland , England , along with its coniferous surrounding , was used to depict the Lockwood Estate exterior . The film crew took plate shots of Cragside and used a computer to combine the shots with footage filmed on set to create the exterior of the Lockwood Estate . No actors were involved in the Cragside shoot . </P> <P> Nicholson previsualized each of the sets that he and his team built to ensure they would be large enough for the intended scenes , stating , `` Someone can tell you a Velociraptor is X-feet long , but until you see it in the space , you ca n't appreciate what that means in terms of your set and the action that needs to take place within it . '' The interior of the multi-floor Lockwood Estate was built entirely on sound stages at Pinewood Studios . The estate set included Eli Mills ' office , Dr. Wu 's large underground laboratory , an underground dinosaur containment facility , separate bedrooms belonging to Benjamin and Maisie Lockwood , and a large library with dinosaur skeletons and artifacts . When filming was completed in the Lockwood library , the set was redecorated and converted into the estate 's underground garage , where the dinosaur auction takes place . Pratt stated that the film involved significantly more stunts than its predecessor . An improvised fist fight scene , between Owen and several men during the dinosaur auction , was added late in filming . It was the first such scene to be featured in the film series , and was filmed in a single continuous shot with the use of a dolly track . </P> <P> On May 10 , 2017 , it was reported that scenes were being filmed at Rock Barracks military base , near Woodbridge , Suffolk . On May 24 , 2017 , scenes were shot at Hampshire 's Blackbushe Airport , which stood in as an American airfield . Filming in the United Kingdom concluded on June 10 , 2017 . Up to that point , Trevorrow was present as an on - set writer for each day of production so he could aid Bayona with any possible script changes . Goldblum shot his scenes in a single day at Pinewood Studios , during the last day of filming in the United Kingdom . Jones also filmed his scenes on large sets at Pinewood Studios . </P> <P> Filming in Hawaii was underway as of June 13 , 2017 , and lasted more than 25 days , with locations that included Dillingham Airfield and Pua'ena Point . On June 21 , 2017 , filming began at He\u02bbeia Kea Small Boat Harbor in He\u02bbeia , Hawaii , which served as Isla Nublar 's shipping dock . More than half of the harbor was closed for filming , which required the use of smoke machines . Scenes were scheduled to be shot at the harbor throughout the end of the month . Filming also took place in a nearby He\u02bbeia jungle for scenes in which Owen searches for and locates Blue . As a reference to the first Jurassic Park film , the scene between Owen and Blue includes an overturned Ford Explorer , previously featured in the original film as a Jurassic Park tour vehicle . Trevorrow had initially considered including the vehicle in a scene in Jurassic World , before settling on the original Jurassic Park visitor center instead . On June 22 , 2017 , the film 's official title was announced as Jurassic World : Fallen Kingdom . At the time , filming was underway at Kualoa Ranch on the Hawaiian island of Oahu . Filming at Kualoa Ranch included the exterior set for a radio tower bunker . </P> <P> In Hawaii , scenes in which characters are running were filmed with the use of the Edge Arm , a stabilized camera that was attached to a crane , which was mounted to a truck that drove alongside the actors . The specialized camera allowed for scenes to be shot steadily despite the truck driving over rough terrain . The film includes a scene on Isla Nublar in which Claire and Franklin are riding in a ball - shaped Jurassic World Gyrosphere ride to evade dinosaurs . The scene was shot at Kualoa Ranch and in England , and Bayona described it as one of the film 's biggest challenges . In Hawaii , the Edge Arm was used to film the actors riding in the Gyrosphere as it was hauled on a trailer to simulate its movement . In England , an outdoor roller coaster track with a 40 - foot drop was constructed for the Gyrosphere , which Howard and Smith rode in to shoot a scene in which the ride plummets off a cliff and into the water surrounding Isla Nublar . Although this portion of the scene could have been shot with the use of a green screen , Bayona wanted the actors to have genuine fear for the scene . The final portion of the scene was shot at Pinewood Studios , where a large indoor tank was constructed and filled with water to depict the submerged ride as Owen tries to break it open and rescue Claire and Franklin . Bayona wanted this portion of the scene to have the appearance of a single continuous shot ; to achieve this , the scene was filmed in five different takes that were merged to make it seem like a single shot . Pratt was aided by a diving instructor for the scene , which also involved Howard and Smith underwater . Filming in the tank lasted five days , and required 85 crew members . The scene in the tank was primarily shot by a second unit crew , as Bayona was busy directing scenes on other soundstages . </P> <P> David Vickery and his team at ILM created the volcanic special effects and consulted volcanologists for research . According to Vickery , the team inquired `` how a volcano of this type might erupt '' and also requested information about `` the various stages of lava and pyroclastic flow . We are speeding it up a bit for the sake of our film , but it is definitely all based on real science . '' All of the lava in the film was created through digital effects , although one scene used cat litter set on fire as a stand - in on set , so the actors would know where to react . The scene was set in an Isla Nublar bunker as lava begins dripping from the roof . The litter had been soaked in flammable liquid , and was dropped from 12 different nozzles above the set . </P> <P> The Main Street section of the Jurassic World theme park was rebuilt on Police Beach in Hawaii for a scene in which Owen and Claire return to the island . The set had previously been built in Louisiana for filming of the previous Jurassic World , but was dismantled after filming concluded . For the sequel , Nicholson had part of the Main Street practically built , although the park 's visitor center could not be constructed in its entirety because of its large size . Unbuilt portions of the park were created by ILM using digital set extensions . Main Street was the largest set built in Hawaii , and required more than three months to complete . Many of the same prop makers returned to recreate the Main Street set , which then had to be aged to give the appearance of abandonment . </P> <P> On July 7 , 2017 , filming took place at Oahu 's H\u0101lona Blowhole , where Pratt , Howard and Smith shot scenes on a beach . Filming concluded on July 8 , 2017 , after shooting was completed at H\u0101lona Blowhole . Bayona said that making the film was the biggest challenge of his life . The original cut of the film was approximately two hours and 45 minutes , which the filmmakers considered too long . The film was trimmed to two hours and eight minutes for the final cut . One scene that was removed from the film would reveal the character of Zia to be a lesbian , an idea that came from Bayona and Trevorrow , who chose to cut it out for runtime reasons . </P> <H3> Creatures on screen </H3> See also : List of cloned animals in the Jurassic Park series <P> The film 's dinosaurs were created through a combination of animatronics and computer - generated imagery ( CGI ) . Special effects artist Neal Scanlan served as the film 's creature effects creative supervisor , while Vickery and Alex Wuttke served as visual effects supervisors . Scanlan worked on the animatronic dinosaurs , while Vickery and his ILM team created versions of the dinosaurs through CGI . ILM animators in Vancouver worked on dinosaur stampede scenes , while ILM 's London studio created the remaining creature scenes . Approximately 52 ILM animators worked on the film . Scanlan worked closely with Bayona and Vickery to create the creatures , and Vickery and ILM did extensive research to accurately create and depict the dinosaurs , which included consulting with paleontologists . The ILM team also referred to elephants and rhinos to determine how the dinosaurs should move and behave . Dinosaur expert John Hankla , of the Denver Museum of Nature and Science , served as an advisor on the film . After reading fan thoughts on dinosaurs and speaking with children , Bayona realized that dinosaur textures and colors were frequently brought up , and stated , `` I thought that was the area where I could play with . They feel somehow a little bit more exotic and richer in this movie . '' New research had also suggested that real dinosaurs were more colorful and brighter than previously thought . </P> <P> The film features more dinosaurs than any previous film in the series , as Bayona wanted to include several new dinosaurs not previously seen in earlier films , including Allosaurus , Baryonyx , Carnotaurus , Sinoceratops , Stygimoloch , and the fictional Indoraptor . Baryonyx and Carnotaurus were among the creatures created through CGI . Dilophosaurus was in the film 's original cut , but was removed . The film features more animatronic dinosaurs than any previous sequel , and the animatronics used were more technologically advanced than in the previous films . Five animatronic dinosaurs were created for the film , whereas the previous film only featured one . More animatronics were used because the film features closer interaction between humans and dinosaurs than its predecessor , including a scene in which Howard rode atop the sedated T. rex . Bayona stated that animatronics `` are very helpful on set , especially for the actors so they have something to perform against . There 's an extra excitement if they can act in front of something real . '' Scanlan stated that animatronics were not best for every scene : `` In some ways it will have an impact on your shooting schedule ; you have to take time to film with an animatronic . In the balance , we ask ourselves if it is economically and artistically more valuable to do it that way , or as a post-production effect . Once we have looked at each particular case , with the director and the VFX supervisor we decide whether -- because of the environment or the circumstances -- it is the right way to go practically . '' </P> <P> Scanlan spent more than eight months at Pinewood Studios to work on the creatures before and during filming , with a crew of approximately 35 people . Scanlan 's team created functional animatronic models of the T. rex , the Indoraptor and Blue , while ILM worked on CGI versions of the creatures . </P> <Ul> <Li> The T. rex was one of the first animatronic creatures needed for filming , in the form of a full - scale head and shoulders . ILM sent Scanlan a model of the T. rex from its appearance in Jurassic World , and Scanlan used it to create a full - scale 3D print of the T. rex head and shoulders . The life - sized T. rex animatronic was controlled through joysticks , with the ability to breathe and move its head . The T. rex animatronic was used for a scene in which the sedated creature is inside a cage while Owen and Claire attempt to retrieve blood from it . The beginning shots in the scene were created using only the animatronic , while the ending shots solely used CGI , with the middle portion of the scene using a combination of the two methods . Within the film 's story , the T. rex is portrayed as the same individual featured in previous films . Trevorrow said , `` We 've been following this same character since the beginning ; she 's the same T. rex that was in Jurassic Park and in Jurassic World . She is iconic -- not just because she 's a T. rex , but because she 's this T. rex . '' </Li> <Li> The Blue animatronic was created to lay down on an operating table , depicting the animal in an injured state while the character of Zia operates on the creature . Up to 12 puppeteers , hidden under the operating table , were needed to control the animatronic during filming . The scene was shot twice , with and without the Blue animatronic , and the two versions were later combined for a seamless effect . In creating Blue through CGI , the animators referred to the animal 's appearance in the previous film . According to Vickery , Blue 's movements were designed to resemble a dog : `` You look at the way Blue cocks her head and looks up at you . It 's exactly like a dog . You 're trying to sort of connect the dinosaur with things that you understand as a human . '' </Li> <Li> The Indoraptor was primarily created through CGI , while a practical head , neck , shoulders , foot and arm were created for close - up shots . For some scenes , an inflatable dinosaur was operated by two puppeteers as a Indoraptor stand - in on set , while a CGI version of the creature would be added in later . The Indoraptor was designed to have long human - like arms , and the creature is depicted as a quadruped and biped , with a height of approximately 10 feet tall while standing on two legs . The Indoraptor 's black color was chosen as Bayona wanted the creature to have the appearance of a black shadow , stating that `` it 's very terrifying when you see the Indoraptor in the dark because you can only see the eyes and the teeth . '' </Li> </Ul> <P> Scanlan 's team also made puppeteering aids , rod puppets , and several prop dinosaurs , all created in coordination with Vickery to ensure a consistent result between the practical effects and CGI . Animal motions that could not be perfected with puppetry , such as blinking , were instead created with computer technology . Among the puppeteer dinosaurs were baby velociraptors , which were used for a scene with Pratt , while the final , wider shots of the scene used two - wheeled , remote - controlled toys to stand - in for the baby raptors on set . The toys included a spring which gave them the ability to jump , and the feature was used to get a genuinely startled reaction from Pratt . Although motion capture was used in the previous film to depict velociraptors , ILM determined after several tests that the technology would not be adequate for depicting dinosaurs in Jurassic World : Fallen Kingdom , and the team chose instead to use key frame animation done for the previous films . However , some motion capture was done as a form of previsualization to aid Bayona . ILM used key framing to create scenes involving a large number of dinosaurs , and referred to high - speed photography of horses racing for aid in creating such scenes . </P> <P> The fight scene between Blue and the Indoraptor , set in Maisie 's bedroom , was designed in London and key framed by ILM . Jance Rubinchik , animation supervisor for ILM , stated that the fight was the `` trickiest sequence '' because of the lack of previsualization . According to Bayona , a Brachiosaurus that is shown dying in the volcanic eruption is meant to be the same individual that is first seen in the original Jurassic Park . The Brachiosaurus in the new film was created using the same animations from the 1993 film . The dinosaur 's death was the last shot on the entire film to be finished ; Bayona and the post-production team stayed up through the night to perfect the scene 's colors and composition , shortly before the film 's release . </P> <P> For advice on veterinary procedures and animatronic movements , the filmmakers sought a veterinary surgeon who had experience with African wildlife . Jonathan Cranston , a Gloucestershire veterinary surgeon , was recommended for the position because of his experience with wildlife in South Africa . Cranston advised Bayona and the producers on how to choreograph several scenes to accurately depict complex veterinarian procedures that involved the dinosaurs . Cranston also worked closely with Pratt , Howard , Pineda and Smith to teach them how to perform such procedures . Additionally , Cranston advised the puppeteers on creating subtle and authentic animal movements , and also worked with Bayona on two scenes . Cranston was on set for 12 days , primarily at Pinewood Studios . </P> <H2> Marketing </H2> <P> A six - second clip from the film was released on November 22 , 2017 . The first trailer was teased for release on November 30 , 2017 , but this was later confirmed to be incorrect . Several teaser trailers and a behind - the - scenes featurette of the film were released in early December 2017 , prior to the release of a full - length trailer on December 7 . That month , Universal launched a website for the Dinosaur Protection Group that ultimately included miscellaneous information about the group and its effort to save the island 's dinosaurs , as well as a video featuring Howard , Pineda and Smith as their characters . The website was created by Timothy Glover and Jack Anthony Ewins , who previously created the Masrani Global website for Jurassic World . A second trailer aired during Super Bowl LII on February 4 , 2018 . A 30 - second teaser trailer was released on April 13 , 2018 , announcing the release of a third full trailer on April 18 . Several of the trailers and commercials for the film included scenes from the ending that depict the Tyrannosaurus rex and the Mosasaurus now loose in the world , which frustrated Trevorrow , who preferred not to show such scenes prior to the film 's release . </P> <P> Universal spent $185 million on partners for a global marketing campaign , more than double the cost of the previous film 's partner program . The campaign included nine partners which aired television commercials and sold products to promote the film . The partners were Dairy Queen , Doritos , Dr Pepper , Ferrero SpA , Jeep , Juicy Fruit , Kellogg 's , M&M 's , and Skittles . The global marketing campaign consisted of 1.3 billion items to promote the film , including 100 million boxes of Kellogg 's products and 15 million packages of Kinder Joy candy by Ferrero . Dairy Queen , a returning partner from the previous film , sold `` Jurassic Chomp '' ice cream desserts in collectable cups , while Doritos and Dr Pepper marketed versions of their products that featured images of the film 's dinosaurs . For Super Bowl LII , Trevorrow directed a Jeep commercial starring Goldblum and featuring a T. rex . Within 24 hours of its release , the commercial received 39.7 million online views , which was more than any film trailer that was watched online following its Super Bowl LII television debut . Universal also teamed up with Amazon for a marketing stunt in which a large dinosaur - sized box was driven around Los Angeles on a truck to promote the film . </P> <P> Licensing partners included Mattel , Lego , and Funko , all of which created toys based on the film . Mattel produced a variety of toys , including dinosaurs and action figures , as well as Barbie dolls featuring the likeness of Pratt and Howard as their characters . A mobile app titled Jurassic World Facts was released as a tie - in to Mattel 's dinosaur toys , which included symbols that could be scanned to collect facts about each creature . Lego is expected to release 13 Lego sets based on the film . A video game , Jurassic World Evolution , was released simultaneously with the film . A two - part virtual reality miniseries titled Jurassic World : Blue was released for Oculus VR headsets as a film tie - in . It was created by Felix & Paul Studios and Industrial Light and Magic , and features Blue on Isla Nublar at the time of the volcanic eruption . A website and campaign for `` Extinction Now ! '' , the antithesis to the Dinosaur Protection Group , was created by Trevorrow , Glover and Ewins , and was launched shortly before the film 's release . The campaign included a found - footage clip of a Tyrannosaurus loose in San Diego , a reference to The Lost World : Jurassic Park . </P> <H2> Release </H2> <P> Jurassic World : Fallen Kingdom had its premiere at the WiZink Center in Madrid , Spain , on May 21 , 2018 .

It also made Universal the second studio ( behind Disney ) to have at least two films in three different franchises make $1 billion worldwide , alongside The Fast and the Furious and Despicable Me . </P> United States and Canada <P> In December 2017 , a survey from Fandango indicated that Fallen Kingdom was one of the most anticipated films of 2018 . Initial projections three weeks before its release had the film grossing between $130 -- 150 million in its opening weekend in the United States and Canada , with BoxOffice magazine estimating a total of $325 -- 380 million for its final domestic gross . By the week of its release , the low - end of projections had reached $135 million . It was released on June 22 , 2018 , in 4,475 theaters ( the second - widest release ever behind Despicable Me 3 ) grossing $58.7 million on its opening day , the second - highest of the franchise and 28th - best on record . The film grossed $15.3 million from Thursday night previews at 3,600 theaters , down from the $18.5 million grossed by Jurassic World . It ended up debuting to $148 million , the 20th - best opening weekend of all - time and second highest for Universal . It also marked the first time two films opened to over $100 million in back - to - back weekends , following the Incredibles 2 's $182.7 million debut the week before . In its second weekend the film made $60 million , a drop of 59 % and less than the $105.8 million made by Jurassic World in its sophomore weekend , and in its third weekend made $28.3 million . </P> Outside north america <P> Overseas , the film was released in 48 countries between June 6 and June 8 , 2018 , including France , Germany , South Korea , the United Kingdom , Italy , Russia , and Spain , and was projected to gross $130 -- 145 million in its opening weekend . It made $20.2 million on its first day , including $1.4 million in France and $1 million in Indonesia . In South Korea , it grossed $9.7 million ( \u20a9 10.3 billion ) and sold over 1 million tickets , setting opening day records for both ( beating The Mummy 's \u20a9 7.4 billion and Avengers : Infinity War 's 980,000 , respectively ) . It went on to have an international debut of $151.1 million , including $8 million from IMAX screenings . Its largest opening markets were South Korea ( $27.2 million ) , the UK ( $19.9 million ) , France ( $10 million ) , Spain ( $9.5 million ) and Germany ( $9.1 million ) . In China , the film was released on June 15 and made $34.4 million ( \u00a5 220 million ) on its opening day , nearly double the first day total of its predecessor ( $17.5 million ) . It went on to open to $111.9 million ( \u00a5 715 million ) , the fourth best - ever in the country for a Hollywood release ( behind The Fate of the Furious , Avengers : Infinity War and Transformers : The Last Knight ) , and bringing the film 's two week international total to $372.1 million , more than the entire lifetime gross of Jurassic Park III ( $368 million ) . In its third week of international release the film made $106.7 million , bringing its total to $561.5 million . China remained one of the top markets with $32.4 million ( a standard 71 % drop for Hollywood films in the country ) , while it was also released in Mexico ( $12.3 million ) , Brazil ( $9.2 million ) and Australia $7.9 million ) . As of July 5 , 2018 , the film has grossed $245.5 million in China , making it the 5th highest grossing Hollywood film of all - time in the country . </P> <H3> Critical response </H3> <P> On review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes , Fallen Kingdom holds an approval rating of 51 % based on 311 reviews , and an average rating of 5.7 / 10 . The website 's critical consensus reads , `` Jurassic World : Fallen Kingdom adds another set piece - packed entry to the blockbuster franchise , although genuinely thrilling moments are in increasingly short supply . '' On Metacritic , which assigns a normalized rating to reviews , the film has a weighted average score of 51 out of 100 , based on 59 critics , indicating `` mixed or average reviews '' . Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of `` A \u2212 '' on an A+ to F scale , while PostTrak reported filmgoers gave it an 82 % overall positive score . </P> <P> Variety 's Owen Gleiberman called the film better than the first Jurassic World but wrote `` ... ( Fallen Kingdom ) ends up being just a so - so ride . I hope the next one is an all - out ride -- but that for the first time since Spielberg 's 1993 original , it 's actually a great one . The audience for this series has proved that it will turn out in mega-droves . '' Lindsey Bahr of the Associated Press wrote , `` Jurassic World : Fallen Kingdom will not stand up to rigorous scrutiny , and yet , it 's kind of an enjoyable , preposterous and thrilling ride that ticks through nostalgia beats like a shopping list . '' The Boston Globe 's Ty Burr likened the film to a `` Universal Studios theme park ride '' noting , `` It 's enough for a fun fright night at the movies but lacks anything else : character , mystery , wonder , danger . The film 's a rush for an audience that only wants the high . '' </P> <P> In a more critical assessment , Peter Travers of Rolling Stone stated that `` ... this sequel has the perfunctory vibe that comes from filmmakers who cynically believe the public will buy anything T. rex - related , no matter how shoddy the goods or warmed - over the plot . '' Senior Editor Matt Goldberg of Collider also criticized the screenplay stating , `` The film is too lazy to even bother with the modest housekeeping of explaining its characters ' motives . '' The Verge 's Bryan Bishop was equally critical , writing , `` Like its predecessor , Fallen Kingdom is overstuffed with ethical conundrums , and not sophisticated enough to fully engage with them ... the movie 's villains become such cartoony caricatures that it 's impossible to take Fallen Kingdom 's attempted philosophical musings seriously . '' Sam Machkovech of Ars Technica called the film a B movie consisting of `` a sixth - grade sketchbook mash of dino - murder , cartoonish villains , and plot holes '' , while Travis M. Andrews of The Washington Post said the film had `` achieved the impossible : it makes dinosaurs boring '' . </P> <P> In a positive review , Scott Mendelson of Forbes wrote , `` Fallen Kingdom is a gorgeous , mostly enjoyable blockbuster that looked great in IMAX . That it does n't cash all the checks it tries to write is why it 's merely a good movie instead of a great one . '' Writing for The Hollywood Reporter , John DeFore also praised the film saying , `` Finally making good on its name , J.A. Bayona 's Jurassic World : Fallen Kingdom says goodbye to the park for good , not just carrying the de-extincted dinos off the island but freeing itself from the genre trappings of the previous four films . '' Exclaim ! 's Alex Hudson said the film is `` a straight - ahead monster movie : it 's dumb , occasionally gory , and mostly plenty of fun ... It wo n't rekindle your childhood fascination with dinosaurs , but it makes for a suitably silly creature feature . '' </P> <P> Many reviewers singled out the scene where a lone Brachiosaurus , stranded on Isla Nublar , succumbs to the volcanic fumes while the characters helplessly watch from the departing ship , as `` poignant '' or `` haunting '' , especially given the species role in the first movie . </P> <H2> Sequel </H2> Further information : Jurassic Park \u00a7 Jurassic World 3 ( 2021 ) <P> An untitled sequel , known as Jurassic World 3 , is scheduled for release on June 11 , 2021 . Trevorrow will direct the film , and will write the screenplay with Emily Carmichael , based on a story by him and Connolly . Trevorrow will also serve as executive producer along with Steven Spielberg ; Marshall and Crowley will serve as producers . Pratt and Howard will reprise their roles for the film . </P> <H2> References </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ Bayona , JA ( December 29 , 2016 ) . `` Excited to announce that my longtime collaborator @ BernatVilaplana will be the editor for the new Jurassic film '' .
