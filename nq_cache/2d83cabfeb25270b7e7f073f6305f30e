The show features a competition in which contestants solve word puzzles , similar to those used in Hangman , to win cash and prizes determined by spinning a giant carnival wheel . </P> <P> Wheel originally aired as a daytime series on NBC from January 6 , 1975 , to June 30 , 1989 . After some changes were made to its format , the daytime series moved to CBS from July 17 , 1989 , to January 11 , 1991 . It then returned to NBC from January 14 , 1991 , until it was cancelled on September 20 , 1991 . The popularity of the daytime series led to a nightly syndicated edition being developed , which premiered on September 19 , 1983 , and continues to air to this day . </P> <P> The network version was originally hosted by Chuck Woolery and Susan Stafford , with Charlie O'Donnell as its announcer . O'Donnell left in 1980 and was replaced by Jack Clark . After Clark 's death in 1988 , M.G. Kelly took over briefly as announcer until O'Donnell returned in 1989 . O'Donnell remained on the network version until its cancellation , and continued to announce on the syndicated show until his death in 2010 , when Jim Thornton succeeded him . Woolery left in 1981 , and was replaced by Pat Sajak . Sajak left the network version in January 1989 to host his own late - night talk show , and was replaced on that version by Rolf Benirschke . Bob Goen replaced Benirschke when the network show moved to CBS , then remained as host until the network show was canceled altogether . Stafford left in 1982 , and was replaced by Vanna White , who remained on the network show for the rest of its run . The syndicated version has been hosted continuously by Sajak and White since its inception . </P> <P> Wheel of Fortune ranks as the longest - running syndicated game show in the United States , with over 6,000 episodes aired . TV Guide named it the `` top - rated syndicated series '' in a 2008 article , and in 2013 , the magazine ranked it at No. 2 in its list of the 60 greatest game shows ever . The program has also come to gain a worldwide following with sixty international adaptations . The syndicated series ' 35th season premiered on September 11 , 2017 . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Gameplay <Ul> <Li> 1.1 Main game </Li> <Li> 1.2 Bonus round </Li> <Li> 1.3 Previous rules </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 Conception and development </Li> <Li> 3 Personnel <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Hosts and hostesses </Li> <Li> 3.2 Announcers </Li> <Li> 3.3 Production staff </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Production <Ul> <Li> 4.1 Set </Li> <Li> 4.2 Music </Li> <Li> 4.3 Audition process </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 5 Broadcast history </Li> <Li> 6 Reception </Li> <Li> 7 Merchandise </Li> <Li> 8 Notes </Li> <Li> 9 References <Ul> <Li> 9.1 Footnotes </Li> <Li> 9.2 Works cited </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 10 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Gameplay ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Main game ( edit ) </H3> The template for round one since the syndicated version 's 32nd season ( 2014 -- 15 ) <P> The core game is based on Hangman . Each round has a category and a blank word puzzle , with each blank representing a letter in the answer , and punctuation revealed as needed . Most puzzles are straightforward figures of speech that fit within a mostly static list of categories , and this list has evolved over the course of the series . Crossword puzzles were added to the rotation in 2016 . In such rounds , a clue bonding the words in the puzzle is given instead of a traditional category , and contestants win by solving all the words in the crossword . The titular Wheel of Fortune is a roulette - style wheel mechanism with 24 spaces , most of which are labeled with dollar amounts ranging from $500 to $900 , plus a top dollar value : $2,500 in round 1 , $3,500 in rounds 2 and 3 , and $5,000 for round 4 and any subsequent rounds . The wheel also features two Bankrupt wedges and one Lose a Turn , both of which forfeit the contestant 's turn , with the former also eliminating any cash or prizes the contestant has accumulated within the round . Each game features three contestants , or occasionally , three two - contestant teams positioned behind a single scoreboard with its own flipper . The left scoreboard from the viewer 's perspective is colored red , the center yellow , and the right blue , with the contestants ' positions determined by a random selection prior to taping . </P> <P> A contestant spins the wheel to determine a dollar value and guess a consonant . Calling a correct letter earns the value before the corresponding flipper , multiplied by the number of times that the letter appears in the puzzle . Calling a correct letter keeps the wheel in the contestant 's control , allowing the contestant to spin again , buy a vowel for a flat rate of $250 , or attempt to solve the puzzle . Contestants may continue to buy vowels so long as they have enough money to keep doing so , until all of the vowels in the puzzle have been revealed . Control passes to the next contestant clockwise if the wheel lands on Lose a Turn or Bankrupt , if the contestant calls a letter that is not in the puzzle , calls a letter that has already been called in that round , fails to call a letter within five seconds of the wheel stopping , or attempts unsuccessfully to solve the puzzle . The only exception is the Free Play wedge , on which the contestant may call a consonant for $500 per occurrence , call a free vowel , or solve the puzzle , with no penalty for an incorrect letter or answer . </P> <P> In the first three rounds , the wheel contains a Wild Card and a Gift Tag , while two 1\u20442 Car tags are present in rounds two and three only ( except on episodes with two - player teams ) . The Wild Card may be used to call an additional consonant after any turn ( for the amount that the contestant has just spun ) or taken to the bonus round to call an extra consonant there . The Gift Tag offers either a $1,000 credit toward purchases from , or $1,000 in cash courtesy of , the sponsoring company , and the 1\u20442 Car tags award a car if the contestant wins the round ( s ) in which he or she claims both . Unlike the other tags , the 1\u20442 Car tags are replaced in subsequent rounds unless the car is won . A special wedge in the first two rounds awards a prize which is described by the announcer if won . All of the tags and the prize wedge are located over the $500 wedges , so calling a letter that appears in the puzzle when landed upon awards both the tag / wedge and $500 per every occurrence of that letter in the puzzle . The first three rounds also contain a special wedge which , if won and taken to the bonus round , offers an opportunity to play that round for $1,000,000 . A contestant must solve the puzzle in order to keep any cash , prizes , or extras accumulated during that round except for the Wild Card , which is kept until the contestant either loses it to Bankrupt or uses it . Bankrupt does not affect score from previous rounds , but it does take away the Wild Card , individual 1\u20442 Car tags , and / or million dollar wedge if any was claimed in a previous round . Contestants who solve a round for less than $1,000 in cash and prizes ( $2,000 on weeks with two - contestant teams ) have their scores increased to that amount . </P> <P> Each game also features three toss - up puzzles , which reveal the puzzle one random letter at a time , and award cash to whoever rings in with the right answer . The first determines who is interviewed first by the host , the second determines who starts round 1 , and the third determines who starts round 4 . Respectively , the toss - ups are valued at $1,000 , $2,000 , and $3,000 . In addition to these , each game has a minimum of four rounds , with more played if time permits . Rounds 2 and 3 are respectively started by the next two contestants clockwise from the contestant who began round 1 . </P> <P> Round 2 features two `` mystery wedges '' . Calling a correct letter after landing upon one offers the contestant the chance to accept its face value of $1,000 per letter , or forfeit that amount to flip over the wedge and see whether its reverse side contains a $10,000 cash prize or Bankrupt . Once either mystery wedge is flipped over , the other becomes a standard $1,000 space and can not be flipped . Round 3 is a prize puzzle , which offers a prize ( usually a trip ) to the contestant who solves it . Starting with season 31 in 2013 , an `` Express '' wedge is also placed on the wheel in round 3 . A contestant who lands on this space and calls a consonant that appears in the puzzle receives $1,000 per appearance . The contestant can then either `` pass '' and continue the round normally , or `` play '' and keep calling consonants for $1,000 each ( without spinning ) and buying vowels for $250 . The Express play ends when the contestant either calls an incorrect letter ( which has the same effect as landing on a Bankrupt wedge ) or solves the puzzle . </P> <P> The final round is always played at least in part in a `` speed - up '' format , in which the host spins the wheel to determine the value of each consonant , with $1,000 being added to the value on which the wheel stops before the red contestant 's arrow . Vowels do not add or deduct money from the contestants ' scores in the speed - up round . The contestant in control calls one letter , and if it appears in the puzzle , the contestant is given three seconds to attempt to solve . Play proceeds clockwise , starting with the contestant who was in control at the time of the final spin , until the puzzle is solved . The three - second timer does not begin until the hostess has revealed all instances of a called letter and moved aside from the puzzle board , and the contestant may offer multiple guesses on his / her turn . After the speed - up round , the total winnings of the three contestants are compared . The contestant with the highest total winnings wins the game and advances to the bonus round . Contestants who fail to earn any cash or prizes in the game are awarded a consolation prize of $1,000 ( or $2,000 on weeks with two - contestant teams ) . </P> <P> If a tie for first place occurs after the speed - up round , an additional toss - up puzzle is played between the tied contestants . The contestant who solves the toss - up puzzle wins $1,000 and advances to the bonus round . </P> <H3> Bonus round ( edit ) </H3> <P> Before the bonus round begins , the winning contestant chooses one of three categories for his or her puzzle ( prior to season 35 , the puzzle and category were predetermined ) . After doing so , the contestant spins a smaller wheel with 24 envelopes to determine the prize . He or she is then shown a puzzle in the chosen category , and every instance of R , S , T , L , N , and E is revealed . The contestant provides three more consonants ( four if he / she is holding the Wild Card ) and one more vowel , then has 10 seconds to solve the puzzle after his or her other letters ( if any ) are revealed . The contestant may make as many guesses as necessary , so long as the contestant begins the correct answer before time expires . Whether or not the contestant solves the puzzle , the host opens the envelope at the end of the round to reveal the prize at stake . Prizes in the bonus round include various cash amounts ( with the lowest being the season number multiplied by $1,000 ) , a vehicle ( or two vehicles during weeks with two - contestant teams ) , and a top prize of $100,000 . </P> <P> If the contestant has the Million Dollar Wedge , the $100,000 envelope is replaced with a $1,000,000 envelope . The $1,000,000 prize has been awarded three times : to Michelle Loewenstein ( on the episode that aired October 14 , 2008 ) , to Autumn Erhard ( May 30 , 2013 ) , and to Sarah Manchester ( September 17 , 2014 ) . Contestants who win the $1,000,000 may receive it in installments over 20 years , or in a lump sum of that amount 's present value . At the end of the Bonus Round , Sajak will reveal where the $1,000,000 wedge was on the prize wheel if the contestant failed to land on it . </P> <H3> Previous rules ( edit ) </H3> <P> Originally , after winning a round , contestants spent their winnings on prizes that were presented onstage . At any time during a shopping round , most often if the contestant did not have enough left to buy another prize , a contestant could choose to put his or her winnings on a gift certificate , or he or she could put the winnings `` on account '' for use in a later shopping round . However , a contestant lost any money on account by landing on Bankrupt or failing to claim it by not winning subsequent rounds . The shopping element was eliminated from the syndicated version on the episode that aired October 5 , 1987 , both to speed up gameplay and to alleviate the taxes paid by contestants . However , the network version continued to use the shopping element until the end of its first NBC run on June 30 , 1989 . </P> <P> Before the introduction of toss - up puzzles at the start of the 18th syndicated season in 2000 , the contestant at the red arrow always started round 1 , with the next contestant clockwise starting each subsequent round . In addition , if a tie for first place occurred , an additional speed - up round was played between the tied contestants for the right to go to the bonus round . The wheel formerly featured a Free Spin wedge , which automatically awarded a token that the contestant could turn in after a lost turn to keep control of the wheel . It was replaced in 1989 with a single Free Spin token placed over a selected cash wedge . Free Spin was retired , and Free Play introduced , at the start of the 27th syndicated season in 2009 . Between September 16 , 1996 and the end of season 30 in 2013 , the show featured a progressive Jackpot wedge , which had been in several different rounds in its history . The jackpot started at $5,000 and had the value of every spin within the round added to it . To claim the jackpot , a contestant had to land on the wedge , call a correct letter , and solve the puzzle all in the same turn . In later years , it also offered $500 per correct letter and $500 to the jackpot , regardless of whether or not it was won in that turn . </P> <P> The network version allowed champions to appear for up to five days originally , which was later reduced to three . The syndicated version , which originally retired contestants after one episode , adopted the three - day champion rule at the start of the seventh season in 1989 . In later years , the top three winners from the week 's first four shows returned to compete in the `` Friday Finals '' . When the jackpot wedge was introduced , it began at $10,000 instead of $5,000 on Fridays . The rules allowing champions to return after their initial appearances were eliminated permanently beginning with the syndicated episode aired September 21 , 1998 , and contestants appear only on a single episode . </P> <P> Before December 1981 , the show did not feature a bonus round . Under the bonus round 's original rules , no letters were provided automatically . The contestant asked for five consonants and a vowel , and then had fifteen seconds to attempt solving the puzzle . Also , bonus prizes were selected by the contestant at the start of the round . The current time limit and rules for letter selection were introduced on October 3 , 1988 . Starting on September 4 , 1989 , the first episode of the seventh syndicated season , bonus prizes were selected by the contestant choosing from one of five envelopes labeled W , H , E , E , and L. One prize was always $25,000 in cash , and the rest were changed weekly . Any prize that was won was taken out of rotation for the rest of the week . During seasons 16 through 18 ( 1998 -- 2001 ) , the $25,000 remained in - place the entire week of shows regardless if it was won . At the start of season 19 in 2001 , there were three car envelopes and two $25,000 envelopes , which were available the entire week of shows . These envelopes were replaced with the bonus wheel on October 22 , 2001 . </P> <H2> Conception and Development ( edit ) </H2> <P> Merv Griffin conceived Wheel of Fortune just as the original version of Jeopardy ! , another show he had created , was ending its 11 - year run on NBC with Art Fleming as its host . Griffin decided to create a Hangman - style game after recalling long car trips as a child , on which he and his sister played Hangman . After he discussed the idea with Merv Griffin Enterprises ' staff , they thought that the idea would work as a game show if it had a `` hook '' . He decided to add a roulette - style wheel because he was always `` drawn to '' such wheels when he saw them in casinos . He and MGE 's then - president Murray Schwartz consulted an executive of Caesars Palace to find out how to build such a wheel . </P> <P> When Griffin pitched the idea for the show to Lin Bolen , then the head of NBC 's daytime programming division , she approved , but wanted the show to have more glamour to attract the female audience . She suggested that Griffin incorporate a shopping element into the gameplay , and so , in 1973 , he created a pilot episode titled Shopper 's Bazaar , with Chuck Woolery as host and Mike Lawrence as announcer . The pilot started with the three contestants being introduced individually , with Lawrence describing the prizes that they chose to play for . The main game was played to four rounds , with the values on the wheel wedges increasing after the second round . Unlike the show it evolved into , Shopper 's Bazaar had a vertically mounted wheel , which was spun automatically rather than by the contestants . This wheel lacked the Bankrupt wedge and featured a wedge where a contestant could call a vowel for free , as well as a `` Your Own Clue '' wedge that allowed contestants to pick up a rotary telephone and hear a private clue about the puzzle . At the end of the game , the highest - scoring contestant played a bonus round called the `` Shopper 's Special '' where all the vowels in the puzzle were already there , and the contestant had 30 seconds to call out consonants in the puzzle . </P> <P> Edd Byrnes , an actor from 77 Sunset Strip , served as host for the second and third pilots , both titled Wheel of Fortune . These pilots were directed by Marty Pasetta , who gave the show a `` Vegas '' feel that more closely resembled the look and feel that the actual show ended up having , a wheel that was now spun by the contestants themselves , and a lighted mechanical puzzle board with letters that were now manually turnable . Showcase prizes on these pilots were located behind the puzzle board , and during shopping segments a list of prizes and their price values scrolled on the right of the screen . By the time production began in December 1974 , Woolery was selected to host , the choice being made by Griffin after he reportedly heard Byrnes reciting `` A-E-I-O-U '' to himself in an effort to remember the vowels . Susan Stafford turned the letters on Byrnes ' pilot episodes , a role that she also held when the show was picked up as a series . </P> <H2> Personnel ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Hosts and hostesses ( edit ) </H3> Chuck Woolery was the show 's host from 1975 to 1981 . <P> The original host of Wheel of Fortune was Chuck Woolery , who hosted the series from its 1975 premiere until December 25 , 1981 , save for one week in August 1980 when Alex Trebek hosted in his place . Woolery 's departure came over a salary dispute with show creator Merv Griffin , and his contract was not renewed . On December 28 , 1981 , Pat Sajak made his debut as the host of Wheel . Griffin said that he chose Sajak for his `` odd '' sense of humor . NBC president and CEO Fred Silverman objected as he felt Sajak , who at the time of his hiring was the weatherman for KNBC - TV , was `` too local '' for a national audience . Griffin countered by telling Silverman he would stop production if Sajak was not allowed to become host , and Silverman acquiesced . </P> Pat Sajak ( right ) and Vanna White have hosted the syndicated version since 1983 . <P> Sajak hosted the daytime series until January 9 , 1989 , when he left to host a late - night talk show for CBS . Rolf Benirschke , a former placekicker in the National Football League , was chosen as his replacement and hosted for a little more than five months . Benirschke 's term as host came to an end due to NBC 's cancellation of the daytime Wheel after fourteen years , with its final episode airing on June 30 , 1989 . When the newly formatted daytime series returned on CBS on July 17 , 1989 , Bob Goen became its host . The daytime program continued for a year and a half on CBS , then returned to NBC on January 14 , 1991 and continued until September 20 , 1991 when it was cancelled for a second and final time . </P> <P> Susan Stafford was the original hostess , serving in that role from the premiere until October 1982 . Stafford was absent for two extended periods , once in 1977 after fracturing two vertebrae in her back and once in 1979 after an automobile accident . During these two extended absences , former Miss USA Summer Bartholomew was Stafford 's most frequent substitute , with model Cynthia Washington and comedian Arte Johnson also filling in for Stafford . </P> <P> After Stafford left to become a humanitarian worker , over two hundred applicants signed up for a nationwide search to be her replacement . Griffin eventually narrowed the list to three finalists , which consisted of Summer Bartholomew , former Playboy centerfold Vicki McCarty , and Vanna White . Griffin gave each of the three women an opportunity to win the job by putting them in a rotation for several weeks after Stafford 's departure . In December 1982 , Griffin named White as Stafford 's successor , saying that he felt she was capable of activating the puzzle board letters ( which is the primary role of the Wheel hostess ) better than anyone else who had auditioned . White became highly popular among the young female demographic , and also gained a fanbase of adults interested in her daily wardrobe , in a phenomenon that has been referred to as `` Vannamania '' . White remained on the daytime series for the rest of the time it was on the air . </P> <P> Sajak and White have starred on the syndicated version continuously as host and hostess , respectively , since it began , except for very limited occasions . During two weeks in January 1991 , Tricia Gist , the girlfriend and future wife of Griffin 's son Tony , filled in for White when she and her new husband , restaurateur George San Pietro , were honeymooning . Gist returned for the week of episodes airing March 11 through 15 , 1991 , because White had a cold at the time of taping . On an episode in November 1996 , when Sajak proved unable to host the bonus round segment because of laryngitis , he and White traded places for that segment . On the March 4 , 1997 episode , Rosie O'Donnell co-hosted the third round with White after O'Donnell's name was used in a puzzle . </P> <P> On April 1 , 1997 , Sajak and Alex Trebek traded jobs for the day . Sajak hosted that day 's edition of Jeopardy ! in place of Trebek , who presided over a special two - contestant Wheel celebrity match between Sajak and White , who were playing for the Boy Scouts of America and the American Cancer Society , respectively ; Lesly Sajak , Pat 's wife , was the guest hostess for the day . In January and February 2011 , the show held a `` Vanna for a Day '' contest in which home viewers submitted video auditions to take White 's place for one episode , with the winner determined by a poll on the show 's website ; the winner of this contest , Katie Cantrell of Wooster , Ohio ( a student at the Savannah College of Art and Design ) , took White 's place for the second and third rounds on the episode that aired March 24 , 2011 . </P> <H3> Announcers ( edit ) </H3> Jim Thornton has been the show 's announcer since 2011 . <P> Charlie O'Donnell was the program 's first and longest tenured announcer . In 1980 , NBC was discussing cancelling Wheel and O'Donnell agreed to take the position as announcer on The Toni Tennille Show . The network decided against the cancellation but O'Donnell decided to honor his commitment and left the series . His replacement was Jack Clark , who added the syndicated series to his responsibilities when it premiered in 1983 and announced for both series until his death in July 1988 . Los Angeles radio personality M.G. Kelly was Clark 's replacement , starting on the daytime series in August 1988 and on the syndicated series when its new season launched a month later . Kelly held these positions until O'Donnell was able to return to the announcer position , doing so after his duties with Barris Industries came to an end at the end of the 1988 -- 89 television season . O'Donnell remained with the series until shortly before his death in November 2010 . Don Pardo , Don Morrow , and Johnny Gilbert have occasionally served as substitute announcers . </P> <P> After O'Donnell's death , the producers sought a permanent replacement , and a series of substitutes filled out the rest of the season , including Gilbert , John Cramer , Joe Cipriano , Rich Fields , Lora Cain and Jim Thornton . For the show 's twenty - ninth season , which began in 2011 , Thornton was chosen to be the new announcer for Wheel , and has been with the show ever since . </P> <H3> Production staff ( edit ) </H3> <P> Wheel of Fortune typically employs a total of 100 in - house production personnel , with 60 to 100 local staff joining them for those episodes that are taped on location . Griffin was the executive producer of the network version throughout its entire run , and served as the syndicated version 's executive producer until his retirement in 2000 . Since 1999 , the title of executive producer has been held by Harry Friedman , who had shared his title with Griffin for his first year , and had earlier served as a producer starting in 1995 . </P> <P> John Rhinehart was the program 's first producer , but departed in August 1976 to become NBC 's West Coast Daytime Program Development Director . Afterwards , his co-producer , Nancy Jones , was promoted to sole producer , and served as such until 1995 , when Friedman succeeded her . In the 15th syndicated season in 1997 , Karen Griffith and Steve Schwartz joined Friedman as producers . Tthey were later promoted to supervising producers , with Amanda Stern occupying Griffith 's and Schwartz 's former position . </P> <P> The show 's original director was Jeff Goldstein , who was succeeded by Dick Carson ( a brother of Johnny Carson ) in 1978 . Mark Corwin , who had served as associate director under Carson , took over for him upon his retirement at the end of the 1998 -- 99 season , and served as such until he himself died in July 2013 ( although episodes already taped before his death continued airing until late 2013 ) . Jeopardy ! director Kevin McCarthy , Corwin 's associate director Bob Cisneros , and Wheel and Jeopardy ! technical director Robert Ennis filled in at various points until Cisneros became full - time director in November 2013 . Ennis returned as guest director for the weeks airing October 13 through 17 and November 17 through 21 , 2014 , as Cisneros was recovering from neck surgery at the time of taping . With the start of the 33rd season on September 14 , 2015 , Ennis was promoted to full - time director . </P> <H2> Production ( edit ) </H2> <P> Wheel of Fortune is owned by Sony Pictures Television ( previously known as Columbia TriStar Television , the successor company to original producer Merv Griffin Enterprises ) . The production company and copyright holder of all episodes to date is Califon Productions , Inc. , which like SPT has Sony Pictures for its active registered agent , and whose name comes from a New Jersey town where Griffin once owned a farm . The rights to distribute the show worldwide are owned by CBS Television Distribution , into which original distributor King World Productions was folded in 2007 . </P> <P> The show was originally taped in Studio 4 at NBC Studios in Burbank . Upon NBC 's 1989 cancellation of the network series , production moved to Studio 33 at CBS Television City in Los Angeles , where it remained until 1995 . Since then , the show has occupied Stage 11 at Sony Pictures Studios in Culver City . Some episodes are also recorded on location , a tradition which began with two weeks of episodes taped at Radio City Music Hall in late 1988 . Recording sessions usually last for five or six episodes in one day . </P> <H3> Set ( edit ) </H3> The current design of the Wheel of Fortune set , as seen on a Season 30 episode The show 's current puzzle board , as seen on a Season 30 episode <P> Various changes have been made to the basic set since the syndicated version 's premiere in 1983 . In 1996 , a large video display was added center stage , which was then upgraded in 2003 as the show began the transition into high - definition broadcasting . In the mid-1990s , the show began a long - standing tradition of nearly every week coming with its own unique theme . As a result , in addition to its generic design , the set also uses many alternate designs , which are unique to specific weekly sets of themed programs . The most recent set design was conceived by production designer Renee Hoss - Johnson , with later modifications by Jody Vaclav . Previous set designers included Ed Flesh and Dick Stiles . </P> <P> The first pilot used a vertically mounted wheel which was often difficult to see on - screen . Flesh , who also designed the sets for The $25,000 Pyramid and Jeopardy ! , designed the wheel mechanism . Originally made mostly of paint and cardboard , the modern wheel mechanism is framed on a steel tube surrounded with Plexiglas and more than 200 lighting instruments , and is held by a stainless steel shaft with roller bearings . Altogether , the wheel weighs approximately 2,400 pounds ( 1,100 kg ) . </P> <P> The show 's original puzzle board had three rows of 13 manually operated trilons , for a total of 39 spaces . On December 21 , 1981 , a larger board with 48 trilons in four rows ( 11 , 13 , 13 and 11 trilons ) was adopted . This board was surrounded by a double - arched border of lights which flashed at the beginning and end of the round . Each trilon had three sides : a green side to represent spaces not used by the puzzle , a blank side to indicate a letter that had not been revealed , and a side with a letter on it . While the viewer saw a seamless transition to the next puzzle , with these older boards in segments where more than one puzzle was present , a stop - down of taping took place during which the board was wheeled offstage and the new puzzle loaded in by hand out of sight of the contestants . On February 24 , 1997 , the show introduced a computerized puzzle board composed of 52 touch - activated monitors in four rows ( 12 on the top and bottom rows , 14 in the middle two ) . To illuminate a letter during regular gameplay , the hostess touches the right edge of the monitor to reveal it . The computerized board obviated the stop - downs , allowing tapings to finish quicker at a lower cost to the production company . </P> <P> Although not typically seen by viewers , the set also includes a used letter board that shows contestants which letters are remaining in play , a scoreboard that is visible from the contestants ' perspective , and a countdown clock . The used letter board is also used during the bonus round , and in at least one case , helped the contestant to see unused letters to solve a difficult puzzle . </P> <H3> Music ( edit ) </H3> <P> Alan Thicke composed the show 's original theme , which was titled `` Big Wheels '' . In 1983 , it was replaced by Griffin 's own composition , `` Changing Keys '' , to allow him to derive royalties from that composition 's use on both the network and syndicated versions . Steve Kaplan became music director starting with the premiere of the 15th syndicated season in 1997 , and continued to serve as such until he was killed when the Cessna 421C Golden Eagle he was piloting crashed into a home in Claremont , California , in December 2003 . His initial theme was a remix of `` Changing Keys '' , but by the 18th syndicated season ( 2000 -- 01 ) , he had replaced it with a composition of his own , which was titled `` Happy Wheels '' . Since 2006 , music direction has been handled by Frankie Blue and John Hoke . Themes they have written for the show include a remix of `` Happy Wheels '' and an original rock - based composition . </P> <P> In addition to `` Changing Keys '' , Griffin also composed various incidental music cues for the syndicated version which were used for announcements of prizes in the show 's early years . Among them were `` Frisco Disco '' ( earlier the closing theme for a revival of Jeopardy ! which aired in 1978 and 1979 ) , `` A Time for Tony '' ( whose basic melody evolved into `` Think ! '' , the longtime theme song for Jeopardy ! ) , `` Buzzword '' ( later used as the theme for Merv Griffin 's Crosswords ) , `` Nightwalk '' , `` Struttin ' on Sunset '' , and an untitled vacation cue . </P> <H3> Audition process ( edit ) </H3> Marty Lublin interviews a potential contestant during an audition at Morongo Casino , Resort & Spa , Cabazon , California The most recent design of the Wheelmobile at the Jackson Rancheria Casino Resort in Jackson , California <P> Anyone at least 18 years old has the potential to become a contestant through Wheel of Fortune 's audition process . Exceptions include employees and immediate family members of CBS Corporation , Sony Pictures Entertainment , or any of their respective affiliates or subsidiaries ; any firm involved in supplying prizes for the show ; and television stations that broadcast Wheel and / or Jeopardy ! , their sister radio stations , and those advertising agencies that are affiliated with them . Also ineligible to apply as contestants are individuals who have appeared on a different game show within the previous year , three other game shows within the past ten years , or on any version of Wheel of Fortune itself . </P> <P> Throughout the year , the show uses a custom - designed Winnebago recreational vehicle called the `` Wheelmobile '' to travel across the United States , holding open auditions at various public venues . Participants are provided with entry forms which are then drawn randomly . Individuals whose names are drawn appear on stage , five at a time , and are interviewed by traveling host Marty Lublin . The group of five then plays a mock version of the speed - up round , and five more names are selected after a puzzle is solved . Everyone who is called onstage receives a themed prize , usually determined by the spin of a miniature wheel . Auditions typically last two days , with three one - hour segments per day . After each Wheelmobile event , the `` most promising candidates '' are invited back to the city in which the first audition was held , to participate in a second audition . Alternatively , a participant may submit an audition form with a self - shot video through the show 's website to enter an audition . Contestants not appearing on stage at Wheelmobile events have their applications retained and get drawn at random to fill second - level audition vacancies . At the second audition , potential contestants play more mock games featuring a miniature wheel and puzzle board , followed by a 16 - puzzle test with some letters revealed . The contestants have five minutes to solve as many puzzles as they can by writing in the correct letters . The people who pass continue the audition , playing more mock games which are followed by interviews . </P> <H2> Broadcast history ( edit ) </H2> <P> Wheel of Fortune premiered on January 6 , 1975 , at 10 : 30 am ( 9 : 30 Central ) on NBC . Lin Bolen , then the head of daytime programming , purchased the show from Griffin to compensate him for canceling the original Jeopardy ! series , which had one year remaining on its contract . Jeopardy ! aired its final episode on the Friday before Wheel 's premiere . The original Wheel aired on NBC , in varying time slots between 10 : 30 am and noon , until June 30 , 1989 . Throughout that version 's run , episodes were generally 30 minutes in length , except for six weeks of shows aired between December 1975 and January 1976 which were 60 minutes in length . NBC announced the cancellation of the show in August 1980 , but it stayed on the air following a decision to cut the duration of The David Letterman Show from 90 to 60 minutes . The network Wheel moved to CBS on July 17 , 1989 , and remained there until January 14 , 1991 . After that , it briefly returned to NBC , replacing Let 's Make a Deal , but was canceled permanently on September 20 of that year . </P> <P> The daily syndicated version of Wheel premiered on September 19 , 1983 , preceded by a series of episodes taped on location at the Ohio State Fair and aired on WBNS - TV in Columbus , Ohio . From its debut , the syndicated version offered a larger prize budget than its network counterpart . The show came from humble beginnings : King World chairmen Roger , Michael , and Robert King could initially find only 50 stations that were willing to carry the show , and since they could not find affiliates for the syndicated Wheel in New York , Los Angeles , or Chicago , Philadelphia was the largest market in which the show could succeed in its early days . Only nine stations carried the show from its beginning , but by midseason it was airing on all 50 of the stations that were initially willing to carry it , and by the beginning of 1984 the show was available to 99 percent of television households . Soon , Wheel succeeded Family Feud as the highest - rated syndicated show , and at the beginning of the 1984 -- 85 season , Griffin followed up on the show 's success by launching a syndicated revival of Jeopardy ! , hosted by Alex Trebek . The syndicated success of Wheel and Jeopardy ! siphoned ratings from the period 's three longest - running and most popular game shows , Tic - Tac - Dough , The Joker 's Wild , and Family Feud , to the point that all three series came to an end by the fall of 1986 . At this point , Wheel had the highest ratings of any syndicated television series in history , and at the peak of the show 's popularity , over 40 million people were watching five nights per week . The series , along with companion series Jeopardy ! , remained the most - watched syndicated program in the United States until dethroned by Judge Judy in 2011 . The program has become America 's longest - running syndicated game show and its second - longest in either network or syndication , second to the version of The Price Is Right which began airing in 1972 . The syndicated Wheel has become part of the consciousness of over 90 million Americans , and awarded a total of over $200 million in cash and prizes to contestants . </P> <P> The popularity of Wheel of Fortune has led it to become a worldwide franchise , with over forty known adaptations in international markets outside the United States . Versions of the show have existed in such countries as Australia , Denmark , France , Germany , Italy , Malaysia , New Zealand , the Philippines , Poland , Russia , Spain , and the United Kingdom . The American version of Wheel has honored its international variants with an occasional theme of special weeks known as `` Wheel Around the World '' , the inaugural episode of which aired when the 23rd syndicated season premiered on September 12 , 2005 . </P> <P> Between September 1997 and January 1998 , CBS and Game Show Network concurrently aired a special children 's version of the show titled Wheel 2000 . It was hosted by David Sidoni , with Tanika Ray providing voice and motion capture for a virtual reality hostess named `` Cyber Lucy '' . Created by Scott Sternberg , the spin - off featured special gameplay in which numerous rules were changed . For example , the show 's child contestants competed for points and prizes instead of cash , with the eventual winner playing for a grand prize in the bonus round . </P> <H2> Reception ( edit ) </H2> <P> Wheel of Fortune has long been one of the highest - rated programs on U.S. syndicated television . It was the highest - rated show in all of syndication before it was dethroned by Two and a Half Men in the 28th season ( 2010 -- 11 ) . The syndicated Wheel shared the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Game / Audience Participation Show with Jeopardy ! in 2011 , and Sajak won three Daytime Emmys for Outstanding Game Show Host -- in 1993 , 1997 , and 1998 . In a 2001 issue , TV Guide ranked Wheel number 25 among the 50 Greatest Game Shows of All Time , and in 2013 , the magazine ranked it number 2 in its list of the 60 greatest game shows ever , second only to Jeopardy ! In August 2006 , the show was ranked number 6 on GSN 's list of the 50 Greatest Game Shows . </P> <P> Wheel was the subject of many nominations in GSN 's Game Show Awards special , which aired on June 6 , 2009 . The show was nominated for Best Game Show , but lost to Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader ? ; Sajak and White were nominated for Best Game Show Host , but lost to Deal or No Deal 's Howie Mandel ; and O'Donnell was considered for Best Announcer but lost to Rich Fields from The Price Is Right . One of the catchphrases uttered by contestants , `` I 'd like to buy a vowel '' , was considered for Favorite Game Show Catch Phrase , but lost to `` Come on down ! '' , the announcer 's catchphrase welcoming new contestants to Price . The sound effect heard at the start of a new regular gameplay round won the award for Favorite Game Show Sound Effect . The sound heard when the wheel lands on Bankrupt was also nominated . Despite having been retired from the show for nearly a decade by that point , `` Changing Keys '' was nominated for Best Game Show Theme Song . However , it lost to its fellow Griffin composition , `` Think ! '' from Jeopardy ! </P> <P> A hall of fame honoring Wheel of Fortune is part of the Sony Pictures Studios tour , and was introduced on the episode aired May 10 , 2010 . Located in the same stage as the show 's taping facility , this hall of fame features memorabilia related to Wheel 's syndicated history , including retired props , classic merchandise , photographs , videos , and a special case dedicated to White 's wardrobe . Two years later , in 2012 , the show was honored with a Ride of Fame on a double decker tour bus in New York City . </P> <H2> Merchandise ( edit ) </H2> <P> Numerous board games based on Wheel of Fortune have been released by different toy companies . The games are all similar , incorporating a wheel , puzzle display board , play money and various accessories like Free Spin tokens . Milton Bradley released the first board game in 1975 . In addition to all the supplies mentioned above , the game included 20 prize cards to simulate the `` shopping '' prizes of the show , with prizes ranging in value from $100 to $3,000 . Two editions were released , with the only differences being the box art and the included books of puzzles . Other home versions were released by Pressman Toy Corporation , Tyco / Mattel , Parker Brothers , Endless Games , and Irwin Toys . </P> <P> Additionally , several video games based on the show have been released for personal computers , the Internet , and various gaming consoles spanning multiple hardware generations . Most games released in the 20th century were published by GameTek , which produced a dozen Wheel games on various platforms , starting with a Nintendo Entertainment System game released in 1987 and continuing until the company closed in 1998 after filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection . Subsequent games were published by Hasbro Interactive and its acquirer Infogrames / Atari ; Sony Online Entertainment , THQ and Ubisoft . </P> <P> Wheel has also been licensed to International Game Technology for use in its slot machines . The games are all loosely based on the show , with contestants given the chance to spin the wheel to win a jackpot prize . Since 1996 , over 200 slot games based on the show have been created , both for real - world casinos and those on the Internet . With over 1,000 wins awarded in excess of $1,000,000 and over $3 billion in jackpots delivered , Wheel has been regarded as the most successful slots brand of all time . </P> <H2> Notes ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ The simplified title is often used by host Pat Sajak on - air and has been used instead of the full title in numerous promotional materials for the show . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ If a contestant can not spin the wheel due to a physical limitation or disability , he / she is accompanied by a `` designated spinner , '' a friend or family member who spins for him / her but is otherwise not involved in the game . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Sajak : `` I 'll give the wheel a final spin , and ask you to give me a letter . If it 's in the puzzle , you have three seconds to solve it . Vowels are worth nothing , consonants are worth ... ( wedge amount ) , we 'll add $1,000 to that , ( dollar amount ) apiece . '' </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ The jackpot wedge was originally in round 3 , was moved to round 2 at the start of the 18th syndicated season in 2000 , and after that moved to round 1 from 2009 to 2013 . </Li> </Ol> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Footnotes ( edit ) </H3> <Ol> <Li> ^ Jump up to : `` Production credits '' .
