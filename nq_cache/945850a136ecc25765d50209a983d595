The show 's format , devised by Briggs , sees contestants taking on multiple - choice questions , based upon general knowledge , winning a cash prize for each question they answer correctly , with the amount offered increasing as they take on more difficult questions . To assist each contestant who takes part , they are given three lifelines to use , may walk away with the money they already have won if they wish not to risk answering a question , and are provided with a safety net that grants them a guaranteed cash prize if they give an incorrect answer , provided they reach a specific milestone in the quiz . </P> <P> The original series aired for 30 series and a total of 592 episodes , from 4 September 1998 to 11 February 2014 , and was presented by Chris Tarrant . Over the course of its run , the original series had around five contestants walk away with the top cash prize of \u00a3 1 million , and faced a number of controversies during its run , including an attempt to defraud the show of its top prize by a contestant . The original format of the programme was tweaked in later years , changing the number of questions from fifteen to twelve and altering the payout structure as a result , and later incorporating a time limit . Four years after the original series ended , ITV unveiled a revived series , created by Stellify Media , to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the programme . The revived format , based upon the original design , was presented by Jeremy Clarkson , and broadcast in 2018 , from 5 to 11 May . </P> <P> The gameshow became one of the most significant shows in British popular culture , ranking 23rd in a list of the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes . Its success led to the programme being exported to many other countries , all of which follow the same general format , though with some versions including unique differences in gameplay and lifelines provided . </P> <H2> Contents </H2> <Ul> <Li> 1 History <Ul> <Li> 1.1 Creation </Li> <Li> 1.2 Original series </Li> <Li> 1.3 Revival </Li> <Li> 1.4 Top prize winners </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 Format <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Auditioning </Li> <Li> 2.2 Game Rules </Li> <Li> 2.3 Lifelines </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Series overview </Li> <Li> 4 Text game ( 2004 -- 2007 ) </Li> <Li> 5 Controversies <Ul> <Li> 5.1 Incorrect answer to question accepted </Li> <Li> 5.2 Schedule rigging allegation </Li> <Li> 5.3 Ambiguous question </Li> <Li> 5.4 Ingram cheating scandal </Li> <Li> 5.5 Phone - a-Friend </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 6 References <Ul> <Li> 6.1 Footnotes </Li> <Li> 6.2 Bibliography </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 7 External links </Li> </Ul> <H2> History ( edit ) </H2> UK presenters of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire ? Chris Tarrant ( 1998 -- 2014 ) Jeremy Clarkson ( 2018 - ) <H3> Creation ( edit ) </H3> <P> The creation of the game show was led by David Briggs , assisted by Mike Whitehill and Steven Knight , who had helped him before with creating a number of promotional games for Chris Tarrant 's morning show on Capital FM radio . The basic premise for the show was a twist on the conventional game - show genre of the time , with a focus towards the setup used in radio quizzes , in that the programme would have one contestant taking on the game and answering questions , but with the ability to pull out at any time , to have certain points in the quiz where , once passed , they could have a set prize given to them if they should give a wrong answer , and be provided with special forms of assistance during their game . During the design phase , the show was given the working title of `` Cash Mountain '' , before Briggs decided upon using the name of the song written by Cole Porter for the 1956 film High Society , as the show 's finalised title . After presenting their idea to ITV , the broadcaster gave the green - light for production to begin on a series . </P> <P> The set designed for Who Wants to Be a Millionaire ? was conceived by British production designer Andy Walmsley , who focused the design towards making contestants feel uncomfortable , creating an atmosphere of tension similar to movie thriller . The design was in stark contrast to the design of sets made for more typical game shows , which are designed to make contestants feel more at ease . Walmsley 's design feature a central stage made primarily with Plexiglas , with a huge dish underneath covered in mirror paper , onto which two slightly - modified , 3 foot ( 0.91 m ) - high Pietranera Arco All chairs were chosen for use by both the contestant and the host , each having an LG computer monitor directly facing each that would be used to display questions and other pertinent information . The rest of the set featured seating spaced out around the main stage in a circle , with breaks in them to allow movement of people on and off the set . The lighting rig used for the set was designed so as to allow only the lights to switch from illuminating the entire set , to focusing on the host and contestant on the main stage when a game was underway , but to include special lighting effects when the contestant reached higher cash prize amounts . His overall conception would eventually prove to be a success , becoming one of the most reproduced scenic designs in television history . </P> <P> The music provided for the show was composed by father - and - son duo Keith and Matthew Strachan . The Strachans ' composition for the game show helped with Briggs ' tense game design , by providing the necessary drama and tension . Unlike other game show musical scores , the music provided for Who Wants to Be a Millionaire ? was designed to be played throughout the entire episode of the show . The Strachans main theme for the game show was inspired from the `` Mars '' movement of Gustav Holst 's The Planets . For the main game of the show , the pair designed the music to feature three variations , with the second and third compositions focused on emphasising the increased tension of the game - as a contestant made progress to higher cash amounts , the pitch of the music was increased by a semitone for each subsequent question . On Game Show Network 's Gameshow Hall of Fame special , the narrator described the Strachan tracks as `` mimicking the sound of a beating heart '' , and stated that as the contestant works their way up the money ladder , the music is `` perfectly in tune with their ever - increasing pulse '' . </P> <H3> Original series ( edit ) </H3> <P> With the show created , ITV assigned Chris Tarrant as its host , and set its premiere to 4 September 1998 . The programme was assigned a timeslot of one hour , to provide room for three commercial breaks , with episodes produced by production company Celador . Originally , the show was broadcast on successive evening for around ten days , before the network modified its broadcast schedule to air it within a primetime slot on Saturday evenings , with occasional broadcasts on Tuesday evenings . Who Wants to Be a Millionaire ? proved a ratings hit , pulling in average viewing figures of up to 19 million during its broadcast in 1999 , though such figures often occurred when the programme was allocated to a half - hour timeslot ; by 2003 , the viewing figures declined to an average of around 8 million viewers . Over the course of his time presenting the game show , Tarrant developed a number of notable catchphrases , including `` Is that your final answer ? '' , and `` But we do n't want to give you that '' , with the latter often used to emphasise his wish to see contestants continue on and win more money . </P> <P> Since its launch , several individuals made claims over the origins of the format or elements of it , with each accusing Celador of breaching their copyrights . In three cases , the matters could not be proven by the claimants - in 2002 , Mike Bull , a Southampton - based journalist , was given an out - of - court settlement when he claimed the authorship of lifelines was his work , though with a confidentiality clause attached ; in 2003 , Sydney resident John J. Leonard made claims in that the show 's format was based on one he had made of a similar nature , but without the concept of lifelines ; in 2004 , Alan Melville was given an out - of - court settlement after he claimed that the opening phrase `` Who wants to be a millionaire ? '' had been taken from document he sent to Granada Television , concerning his idea for a game show based on the lottery . </P> <P> One of most significant claims Celador received against them was from John Bachini . In 2002 , he started legal proceedings against the production company , ITV , and five individuals who had claimed they had created Who Wants to Be a Millionaire ? , stating that the idea from the show was taken from several elements he had created - a board game format he conceived in 1981 ; a two - page TV format , known as Millionaire , made in 1990 ; and the telephone mechanics for a TV concept he created in 1990 , BT Lottery . In his claim , Bachini stated that he submitted documents for his TV concepts to Paul Smith , from a sister company of Celador 's , in March 1995 and again in January 1996 , and to Claudia Rosencrantz of ITV , also in January 1996 , accusing both of using roughly 90 % of the format for Millionaire in the pilot for the game show , including the use of twenty questions , lifelines and safety nets , although the lifelines were conceived under different names - Bachini claimed that he never coined the phrase `` phone - a-friend '' that Briggs designed in his format . In response to this claim , Celdaor made a counter-claim that the franchise originated from the basic format idea conceived by Briggs . The defendants in the claim took Bachini to a summary hearing , but lost their right to have his claim dismissed . Although Bachini won the right to go to trial , he was unable to after the hearing due to serious illness . Celador eventually settled the matter with him out - of - court . </P> <P> In March 2006 , Celador began procedures to sell the format of the show and all UK episodes , as part of their first step towards the sale of their formats divisions . The purchase of both assets was made by Dutch company 2waytraffic , which were then passed on to Sony Pictures Entertainment in 2008 when it acquired 2waytraffic . As the original series progress , variations of the format were created , and screened as special episodes , including celebrity editions , games featuring couples as contestants , and episodes themed around special events such as Mother 's Day . </P> <P> From April 2011 , only celebrity contestants appeared on the show , in special live editions that coincided with holidays , events and other notable moments , such as the end of a school term . However , in 2012 , three special episodes , entitled `` The People Play '' , were broadcast for three consecutive nights between 9 and 11 July . They featured standard contestants , with viewers at home allowed to play along . The special was used three more times in 2013 , once on 7 May , and twice more on 21 May , before the special 's format was discontinued . </P> <P> On 22 October 2013 , Tarrant announced that after fifteen years of hosting the programme , he would be leaving Who Wants to Be a Millionaire ? , which consequently led ITV to axe the programme once his contract was finished ; no more specials would be filmed after this announcement , leaving only those made before it to be aired as the final episodes . After a few more celebrity editions of the game show , Tarrant hosted his final episode , a clip show entitled `` Chris ' Final Answer '' , aired on 11 February 2014 . </P> <H3> Revival ( edit ) </H3> <P> In 2018 , ITV revived the show for a new series , as part of its 20th anniversary commemorations of the programme . On 23 February , the broadcast put out a casting call for contestants who would appear on the game show . On 9 March , Jeremy Clarkson was confirmed as the new host of the show . On 13 April , the trailer for the revival premiered on ITV and confirmed that the show would return in May for a week long run , with it later confirmed on 25 April , that the show would begin airing from 5 May and finish 11 May . The revival received mostly positive reviews from critics and fans . </P> <H3> Top prize winners ( edit ) </H3> <P> Over the course of the programme 's broadcast history , it has had to date five winners who managed to successfully receive its top prize of \u00a3 1 million . They include : </P> <Ul> <Li> Judith Cynthia Aline Keppel , a cash - strapped garden designer at the time . On 20 November 2000 , she became the first contestant to win the top prize , and is to date the only woman to have received it in the British original . Following her success , Keppel later went onto become part of team of quiz experts for the BBC game show , Eggheads . </Li> <Li> David Edwards , a former physics teacher of Cheadle High School and Denstone College in Staffordshire . On 21 April 2001 , he became the first man to win the top prize . Following his success , Edwards went on to compete in both series of Are You an Egghead ? , in 2008 and 2009 respectively , but failed to win either series and secure a place as a panellist on Eggheads . </Li> <Li> Robert Kempe Brydges , an Oxford - educated banker from Holland Park , London . On 29 September 2001 , he became the third person to win the show 's top prize . </Li> <Li> Pat Gibson , a multiple world champion Irish quiz player . On 24 April 2004 , he became the fourth person to win the top prize , and is the only person in the show 's history to reach the final question with two lifelines still intact . </Li> <Li> Ingram Wilcox , a British quiz enthusiast . On 23 September 2006 , he became the fifth person to win the top prize , and is to date , the most recent person to answer the show 's final question . </Li> </Ul> <H2> Format ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Auditioning ( edit ) </H3> <P> Members of the public wishing to apply for the game show are provided with four options to choose form - calling / texting a premium - rate number ; submitting an application via the show 's ITV website , using a system of \u00a3 1 `` credits '' ; taking part in a casting audition , held at various locations around the UK . Once an application is made , production staff select an episode 's contestants through a combination of random selection , and a potential contestant 's ability to answer a set of test questions based on general knowledge . </P> <H3> Game rules ( edit ) </H3> A contestant being asked a question about pop music on the show . <P> Once a contestant has auditioned for a part on the programme and filming takes place , they undertake a preliminary round entitled `` Fastest Finger First '' - the group of contestants seeking a chance to take on the main game of the show , must answer a single question correctly , but do so faster than their opponents . Initially , the round required contestants to provide the correct answer to a question , but from the second series onwards , they are tasked with putting four answers in the correct order stated within the question ( i.e. earliest to latest ) . The contestant who answers a question correctly and in the fastest time , moves on towards playing the main game ; in the event that no - one answers the question correctly , a new question is given , while if two or more contestants give the correct answer in the same amount of time , they undergo a tiebreaker question to determine who takes on the main game . This round is primarily used to determine the new contestant for the main game , and can often be used more than once in an episode . </P> <P> After completing the preliminary round , the contestant now begins taking on the main game , tackling a series of increasingly difficult question , which offering increasingly high sums of money , up to the top prize of \u00a3 1 million . The questions they undertake are randomly chosen from list of generated questions based on general knowledge , with each consisting of four answers to choose from . While undertaking questions , the contestant is allowed to use a set of lifelines to provide them assistance with a question at any time , and two safety nets - if a contestant gets a question wrong , but had reached a designated cash value during their game , they left with that amount as their prize . Unlike other game shows , if a contestant is unsure about a question they are facing , they are allowed to leave the game at that point with the cash amount they had managed to win by that stage . While the initial questions are generally easy , the subsequent ones after it require the contestant to confirm that their answer / decision is final by the host , at which point it is locked in and can not be reversed . As a rule , the host is not shown the correct answer , until a contestant has given their answer . If an episode is reaching the end of its allotted , an audio cue is triggered to highlight this ; contestants still playing the main game are left to wait until filming for the next episode begins to continue , though this is not the case for special editions of the show , such as celebrity episodes . </P> <P> Over the course of the show 's history on British television , the format of the programme was altered in a number of aspects , mainly towards the setup of questions and the payout structure used in the game show , along with minor tweaks and changes in other aspects : </P> <Ul> <Li> Between 1998 and 2007 , the format focused on contestants answering 15 questions , with two safety nets placed at \u00a3 1,000 and \u00a3 32,000 respectively , and the use of three standard lifelines . The payout structure during these years was focused as follows : </Li> </Ul> <Dl> <Dd> \u00a3 100 - > \u00a3 200 - > \u00a3 300 - > \u00a3 500 - > \u00a3 1,000 - > \u00a3 2,000 - > \u00a3 4,000 - > \u00a3 8,000 - > \u00a3 16,000 - > \u00a3 32,000 - > \u00a3 64,000 - > \u00a3 125,000 - > \u00a3 250,000 - > \u00a3 500,000 - > \u00a3 1,000,000 </Dd> </Dl> <Ul> <Li> Between 2007 and 2014 , the number of questions was reduced to 12 . This alteration led to the second safety net being assigned to a new cash value , \u00a3 50,000 , and the payout structure being changed as a result : </Li> </Ul> <Dl> <Dd> \u00a3 500 - > \u00a3 1,000 - > \u00a3 2,000 - > \u00a3 5,000 - > \u00a3 10,000 - > \u00a3 20,000 - > \u00a3 50,000 - > \u00a3 75,000 - > \u00a3 150,000 - > \u00a3 250,000 - > \u00a3 500,000 - > \u00a3 1,000,000 </Dd> <Dd> In 2010 , the format was further changed in three factors . The first was the discontinuation of the preliminary round , meaning new contestants were selected by production staff before a new run of the main game was played . The second was the inclusion of a fourth lifeline . The third was adoption of the time - limit format from the US version , but with some differences - the time limit was active for the first seven questions - 15 seconds for the first two questions , and 30 seconds for the other five - and if a contestant ran out of time , it was treated as an incorrect answer and thus affected their winnings , though time was briefly paused when a lifeline is used by the contestant . </Dd> </Dl> <Ul> <Li> For the revived series in 2018 , the format returned to that used between 1998 -- 2007 , including the payout structure , but with one noticeable difference . Apart from the use of a brand new , fourth lifeline , the series included a new rule in which upon reaching \u00a3 1,000 , the contestant would be asked before each subsequent question if they would like to set the cash prize for that question as their second safety net , with it offered up to \u00a3 500,000 . </Li> </Ul> <H3> Lifelines ( edit ) </H3> <P> During a contestant 's game , they may make use of a set of lifelines to provide assistance on a question . Throughout the course of the show 's history , these lifelines involve the following : </P> <Ul> <Li> 50 / 50 : Two random incorrect answers are eliminated , leaving the correct answer and one incorrect answer , thus granting the contestant a 50 / 50 chance of answering a question correctly . </Li> <Li> Phone a Friend : The contestant calls one of their friends , and has 30 seconds to read the question and the possible answers to them . The friend uses the leftover time to offer an answer . Since 2018 , a member of the production team accompanies the friend to prevent cheating . </Li> <Li> Ask the Audience : Audience members use keypads to vote on what they believe to be the correct answer to the question . The percentage of the audience choosing each specific option is displayed to the contestant , after this vote . </Li> <Li> Switch ( 2002 -- 03 , 2010 -- 14 ) : The computer replaces one question with another of the same monetary value . Any lifelines already used on the original question are not reinstated . From 2010 to 2014 , this lifeline was earned after the contestant answered seven questions correctly . </Li> <Li> Ask the Host ( 2018 ) : The contestant asks the host to help provide an answer on a question . No time limit is associated with the lifeline , while , in addition to standard rules , the host has no contact with outside sources to help them . </Li> </Ul> <H2> Series overview ( edit ) </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Series </Th> <Th> Start date </Th> <Th> End date </Th> <Th> Episodes </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> 4 September 1998 </Td> <Td> 25 December 1998 </Td> <Td> 11 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> 1 January 1999 </Td> <Td> 13 January 1999 </Td> <Td> 13 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> 5 March 1999 </Td> <Td> 16 March 1999 </Td> <Td> 12 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> 3 September 1999 </Td> <Td> 14 September 1999 </Td> <Td> 13 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 5 </Td> <Td> 5 November 1999 </Td> <Td> 26 December 1999 </Td> <Td> 18 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 6 </Td> <Td> 16 January 2000 </Td> <Td> 22 January 2000 </Td> <Td> 7 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 7 </Td> <Td> 26 March 2000 </Td> <Td> 1 May 2000 </Td> <Td> 13 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 8 </Td> <Td> 7 September 2000 </Td> <Td> 6 January 2001 </Td> <Td> 55 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 9 </Td> <Td> 8 January 2001 </Td> <Td> 26 April 2001 </Td> <Td> 45 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 10 </Td> <Td> 4 September 2001 </Td> <Td> 29 December 2001 </Td> <Td> 43 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 11 </Td> <Td> 5 January 2002 </Td> <Td> 9 April 2002 </Td> <Td> 55 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 12 </Td> <Td> 31 August 2002 </Td> <Td> 28 December 2002 </Td> <Td> 19 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 13 </Td> <Td> 4 January 2003 </Td> <Td> 31 May 2003 </Td> <Td> 21 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 14 </Td> <Td> 30 August 2003 </Td> <Td> 27 December 2003 </Td> <Td> 21 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 15 </Td> <Td> 3 January 2004 </Td> <Td> 5 June 2004 </Td> <Td> 23 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 16 </Td> <Td> 18 September 2004 </Td> <Td> 25 December 2004 </Td> <Td> 16 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 17 </Td> <Td> 1 January 2005 </Td> <Td> 11 June 2005 </Td> <Td> 24 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 18 </Td> <Td> 17 September 2005 </Td> <Td> 31 December 2005 </Td> <Td> 11 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 19 </Td> <Td> 7 January 2006 </Td> <Td> 8 July 2006 </Td> <Td> 27 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 20 </Td> <Td> 9 September 2006 </Td> <Td> 6 January 2007 </Td> <Td> 13 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 21 </Td> <Td> 10 March 2007 </Td> <Td> 28 July 2007 </Td> <Td> 17 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 22 </Td> <Td> 18 August 2007 </Td> <Td> 30 October 2007 </Td> <Td> 11 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 23 </Td> <Td> 1 January 2008 </Td> <Td> 3 June 2008 </Td> <Td> 19 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 24 </Td> <Td> 16 August 2008 </Td> <Td> 31 January 2009 </Td> <Td> 18 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 25 </Td> <Td> 13 June 2009 </Td> <Td> 20 December 2009 </Td> <Td> 20 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 26 </Td> <Td> 13 April 2010 </Td> <Td> 8 June 2010 </Td> <Td> 8 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 27 </Td> <Td> 3 August 2010 </Td> <Td> 23 December 2010 </Td> <Td> 11 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 28 </Td> <Td> 2 April 2011 </Td> <Td> 19 December 2011 </Td> <Td> 6 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 29 </Td> <Td> 3 January 2012 </Td> <Td> 20 December 2012 </Td> <Td> 11 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 30 </Td> <Td> 1 January 2013 </Td> <Td> 11 February 2014 </Td> <Td> 11 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 31 </Td> <Td> 5 May 2018 </Td> <Td> 11 May 2018 </Td> <Td> 7 </Td> </Tr> </Table> <H2> Text game ( 2004 -- 2007 ) ( edit ) </H2> <P> On 23 October 2004 the show included a new feature called the `` Walkaway Text Game '' .

The viewer who answered the question won \u00a3 1,000 by having their entries selected randomly . </P> <P> On 9 September 2006 , there were some changes . The competition stayed the same but this time , they played it before some commercial breaks . A question to which the contestant had given their final answer , but the correct answer had not yet been revealed , was offered as a competition to viewers . Entry was via SMS text message at a cost of \u00a3 1 per entry , and the competition ran through the commercial break , after which the answer was revealed and the game continued . One viewer who answered the question correctly won \u00a3 1,000 . The text game ended on 28 July 2007 . </P> <H2> Controversies ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Incorrect answer to question accepted ( edit ) </H3> <P> In March 1999 , the Daily Mirror published a report that accused the show of allowing a contestant , Tony Kennedy , to win a question by giving an incorrect answer . During Kennedy 's game , when he had reached the \u00a3 64,000 question , he was asked `` Theoretically , what is the minimum number of strokes with which a tennis player can win a set ? '' , and given four possible answers - twelve , twenty four , thirty six , and forty eight . Kennedy calculated that a player would need four shots to win a game , with six games in a set , giving an answer of twenty four , but the newspaper reported that this was incorrect , stating that a tennis player could win a game without playing a shot - if their opponent double - faulted on every serve , and the player aced each of their own serves , it would allow them to win with just 12 strokes . Based on their findings , the production staff acknowledged the mistake and apologised for it , but allowed Kennedy to keep the prize money he won by the end of his game . </P> <H3> Schedule rigging allegation ( edit ) </H3> <P> When Judith Keppel 's victory as the first UK jackpot winner on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire ? was announced by ITV on the day of that the corresponding episode was to be broadcast , several allegations were made that Celador had rigged the show to spoil the BBC 's expected high ratings for the finale of One Foot in the Grave . Richard Wilson , the lead star on the sitcom , was quoted in particular for saying that the broadcaster had `` planned '' the win , adding `` it seems a bit unfair to take the audience away from Victor 's last moments on earth . '' David Renwick , writer of the sitcom , voiced annoyance that the episode would draw away interest from the sitcom 's finale , believing that a leaked press release on ITV 's announcement had been `` naked opportunism '' , and it `` would have been more honorable to let the show go out in the normal way '' , pointing out that it `` killed off any element of tension or surprise in their own programme '' , but that `` television is all about ratings '' . Richard Webber 's account , in his 2006 book , cites `` unnamed BBC sources '' as those who `` questioned the authenticity of Keppel 's victory '' . The allegations in turn led to eleven viewers making complaints against the quiz show , of a similar nature , to the Independent Television Commission ( ITC ) . </P> <P> In response , ITV expressed distress to the allegations , claiming that it `` undermined viewers ' faith in the programme . '' Leslie Hill , the chairman of ITV , wrote to Sir Christopher Bland , the chairman of the Board of Governors of the BBC , to complain about the issue . The corporation apologised , saying that any suggestion of ' rigging ' `` did not represent the official view of the BBC '' , while the ITC 's investigation cleared the programme of any wrongdoing . </P> <H3> Ambiguous question ( edit ) </H3> <P> On 11 February 2006 , celebrity couple Laurence Llewelyn - Bowen and his wife Jackie took on the game show to raise money for their chosen charity - The Shooting Star Children 's Hospice . Having reached the final question of the quiz , they were asked `` Translated from the Latin , what is the motto of the United States ? '' , to which the Bowens answered with `` In God , We Trust '' , only to learn that the question 's correct answer was `` One Out of Many '' - the English translation for the Latin E pluribus unum . However , Celador later admitted that the question had been ambiguous and not fair to the pair - although E pluribus unum is considered the de facto motto of the United States , it was never legally declared as such ; In God , We Trust is the official motto of the country since 1956 , although it is not translated from any form of Latin . Following this revelation , the production company invited the Bowens back to tackle a new question , with their original winnings reinstated ; the couple chose not to risk the new question , and left with \u00a3 500,000 for their charity . </P> <H3> Ingram cheating scandal ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Charles Ingram - Who Wants to Be a Millionaire ? scandal Charles Ingram and his wife Diana . Both had previously made appearances on the show , before Charles ' controversial game in September 2001 . <P> In September 2001 , British Army Major Charles Ingram became a contestant on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire ? , joined by his wife Diana , and a close friend and college lecturer , Tecwen Whittock . After the first day of filming , the group devised a scheme that would allow Ingram to win the \u00a3 1 million cash prize when he returned for the second day of recording , on 10 September - for each question he faced , the correct answer would be signalled to Ingram by a cough made by Whittock ; Ingram would differentiate the way he received this to avoid making the scheme too obvious , such as reading aloud all four answers , or dismissing an answer and then choosing it again later . Although the scheme proved successful , by the time he had reached the final questions , production staff off - stage had become suspicious over the amount of background noise being made by Whittock 's coughing , while noting that Ingram seemed to show no specialist knowledge of any subjects he faced with each question . </P> <P> After the second day of recording ended , the production staff ordered an immediate investigation on the grounds that cheating had occurred , suspending the broadcast of both episodes that had been filmed . Ingram was subsequently informed that he was being investigated for cheating and would not receive his winnings . While reviewing the recording , production staff began to see a pattern between Whittock 's coughing , and Ingram 's unusual behaviour when he answered questions ; at one point , they noticed Ingram gave an answer when Diana had coughed after he read it aloud . By this point , Celador was convinced that cheating had occurred , and the matter was handed over to police . Both the Ingrams and Whittock were charged with `` procuring the execution of a valuable security by deception '' , and taken to Southwark Crown Court in 2003 . </P> <P> During the four - week long trial , the Prosecution provided evidence towards the charges , which included a recording of Ingram 's second day on Who Wants to Be a Millionaire ? , pager telephone records for a previous scheme the group intended to use , before deeming it too complicated - a system of four pagers intended to be hidden on Ingram 's body , in which a pager 's vibrations signalled the correct answer - and testimony from one of the production staff and a `` Fastest Finger '' contestant attending the recording , Larry Whitehurst . Although the Defence provided evidence claiming Whittock 's coughing was a result of dust allergies and a hay fever he was suffering from , and Whittock himself testified against the accusations , the Prosecution refuted these claims with their evidence , including footage that showed Whittock stopped coughing when he became a contestant after Ingram . On 7 April 2003 , the group were found guilty , with all three given suspended prison sentences and fines , with the Ingrams later ordered to pay legal costs within two months of the trial 's conclusion . On 24 July 2003 , the British Army ordered Charles Ingram to resign his commission as a Major , in the wake of the trial . </P> <P> In the aftermath of the trial , the scandal became the subject of a documentary entitled Millionaire : A Major Fraud , presented by Martin Bashir and broadcast on 21 April 2003 , with a follow - up two weeks later entitled Millionaire : The Final Answer . The documentary featured excerpts from the recording that had been enhanced for the Ingrams ' trial , footage of the actions made by Ingram 's wife in the audience , and interviews with production staff and some of the contestants who had been present during the recording . None of the defendants in the case took part , with Ingram later describing Major Fraud and a subsequent programme of the matter , shown on ITV2 , as `` one of the greatest TV editing con tricks in history '' . Chess grandmaster James Plaskett later wrote an essay arguing in favour of the group 's innocence ; journalists Bob Woffinden , and Jon Ronson , each wrote a piece influenced by this essay , with Woffinden collaborating with Plaskett on a book entitled Bad Show : The Quiz , The Cough , The Millionaire Major , published in 2015 , arguing that Ingram 's appearance on the show coinciding with Whittock 's was `` chance '' . A play based upon the events of the scandal was written by James Graham , entitled Quiz , and was performed from 3 November 2017 to 9 December 2017 , before being performed in the West End from 31 March 2018 to 16 June 2018 . </P> <H3> Phone - a-friend ( edit ) </H3> <P> The Phone - a-Friend lifeline provided multiple instances of controversy during the show 's run . A 2002 edition of the Daily Mail reported that many contestants had selected strangers who were `` contacts among the quizzing fraternity '' to act as their Phone - a-Friends . Specifically , game show champion Daphne Fowler was approached by a man she had not previously met and asked if she would be his lifeline in exchange for \u00a3 200 . Fowler refused , adding : `` I thought a fair price would be a quarter of whatever the man won , so if I helped him get from \u00a3 32,000 to \u00a3 64,000 I would expect to get \u00a3 16,000 . '' The man was later revealed by ITV sources not to have made it onto the programme . </P> <P> In March 2007 various UK newspapers reported that an organised syndicate had been getting quiz enthusiasts onto the show in return for a percentage of their winnings . The person behind the syndicate was Keith Burgess from Northern Ireland . Burgess admitted to helping around 200 contestants to appear on the show since 1999 ; he estimates those contestants to have won around \u00a3 5,000,000 . The show producers are believed to have been aware of this operation , with Burgess stating : `` The show knows about me and these types of syndicates , but they cover it up to keep the show going . '' An earlier version of a Phone a Friend syndicate was reported in the Northampton Chronicle and Echo during 2003 . Paul Smith , the Managing Director of Celador Productions , stated : `` We are aware of Paddy Spooner and what people similar to him are doing , and we have made a priority of changing our question procedure . We are confident we have now made it impossible for anyone to manipulate the system . '' Since then , the options of people that can be called have a picture of themselves shown on - air . </P> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Footnotes ( edit ) </H3> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ `` Who Wants To Be A Millionaire ?
