Back at the walls , an unconscious Mikasa has a dream about the past , wherein she tried to protect Eren from the neighborhood bullies , but she is distraught to find him gone when she awakes . Armin tells Mikasa that Eren and Ymir were captured , but nothing can be done in their current state . Hannes reminds Mikasa and Armin that Eren has a steadfast resolve . As Erwin soon arrives with reinforcements , Hange posits that Reiner and Bertholdt may seek the Forest of Giant Trees nearby to safely rest until nightfall , assuming that their goal is to relocate outside of Wall Maria . Eren and Ymir are shown waking in the forest as their bodies begin to regenerate their limbs , while Reiner and Bertholdt watch over them . The Scouts depart from Wall Rose to mount a rescue operation . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> 34 </Th> <Td> 9 </Td> <Td> `` Opening '' `` Kaik\u014d '' ( \u958b\u53e3 ) </Td> <Td> Yoshihide Ibata </Td> <Td> Yasuko Kobayashi </Td> <Td> May 27 , 2017 </Td> <Td> June 24 , 2017 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan=\"7\"> As Erwin leads the expedition away from Wall Rose , Hange requests a horseback ride to Ragako to see the immobilized Titan , but Moblit decides to go in her stead since she is badly injured . Meanwhile , in the Forest of Giant Trees , as Eren and Ymir continue to regenerate their limbs , Ymir points out that not only are they are surrounded by Titans , but also Reiner and Bertholdt stole their omni - directional mobility gear . Reiner and Bertholdt plan to take Eren and Ymir to their hometown , but are waiting until nightfall when the surrounding Titans can not move . Eren is reminded by Ymir that they are in no position to fight or flee until they regenerate . Reiner begins to ramble about his duty as a soldier and as a warrior , which Ymir deduces that there is confusion between his undercover and real personas . Ymir is highly concerned about the Beast Titan , who caused the recent Titan invasion and may be their real enemy . Reiner then uses Ymir 's concern for Christa 's safety as leverage to drive a wedge between Eren and Ymir . The discussion is interrupted by the sound of flare guns , signalling the arrival of the Scouts . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> 35 </Th> <Td> 10 </Td> <Td> `` Children '' `` Kodomotachi '' ( \u5b50\u4f9b \u9054 ) </Td> <Td> Kenji Imura </Td> <Td> Hiroshi Seko </Td> <Td> June 3 , 2017 </Td> <Td> July 8 , 2017 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan=\"7\"> Moblit arrives at Ragako and recognizes the disabled Titan as Conny 's mother after seeing a portrait of Conny 's parents . At the Forest of Giant Trees , after Eren is restrained , Ymir says that Reiner and Bertholdt must take Christa with them . In a flashback , Ymir was worshiped by a cult as a child under supposed royalty . The cult was later apprehended and punished by soldiers , in which Ymir was injected with something and thrown off a wall , resulting in her transforming into the Dancing Titan . Ymir spent the next sixty years as a Titan , and she ate Marcel , a childhood friend of Reiner , Bertholdt and Annie , before returning to human form . She realized that her freedom of accepting her true identity was why she developed such empathy with Christa . In the present , Ymir convinces Reiner and Bertholdt to allow her to transform into the Dancing Titan and take Christa with them . When the Scouts enter the forest , Ymir finds and swallows Christa before rejoining Reiner and Bertholdt . Reiner transforms as the Armored Titan , while Bertholdt , Eren and Ymir climb on its shoulders , as they flee at the edge of the forest with the Scouts in hot pursuit . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> 36 </Th> <Td> 11 </Td> <Td> `` Charge '' `` Totsugeki '' ( \u7a81\u6483 ) </Td> <Td> Hiroyuki Tanaka Yasuhiro Akamatsu </Td> <Td> Hiroshi Seko </Td> <Td> June 10 , 2017 </Td> <Td> July 15 , 2017 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan=\"7\"> As the Armored Titan flees , Ymir regurgitates Christa and exits her Titan form in order to explain her seemingly selfish actions to Christa . The Scouts close in on the Armored Titan , but Mikasa is foiled when the Armored Titan blocks her from attacking Bertholdt and saving Eren . The other 104th Cadets arrive to reason with Bertholdt , but he professes that there is no turning back from their mission , despite being their comrade . Erwin uses himself as bait to lure a group of Titans charging towards the Scouts chasing the Armored Titan , and the Scouts are ordered to scatter their formation and charge at the Titans . The Armored Titan is consequently attacked by the Titans , forcing it to defend itself and release Eren and Bertholdt . Armin , Erwin and Mikasa work together to distract Bertholdt , cut Eren free and rescue Eren . Conny and Sasha retrieve Christa and explain that Ymir is lying about her recent actions . The Scouts are hampered from retreating when the Armored Titan throws Titans at them , knocking Eren and Mikasa off their horse .

Hannes sacrifices himself protecting Eren and Mikasa from the Smiling Titan . At first failing to transform , Eren breaks down despairingly , but a heartfelt profession of love from Mikasa rekindles his spirit , activating an unknown power within him that causes the surrounding Titans to devour the Smiling Titan . Ymir realizes that Reiner and Bertholdt want Eren because he possesses the Coordinate , the ability to control other Titans . The surviving Scouts escape after Eren causes the Titans to go after the Armored Titan . Ymir decides to leave Christa in order to save the Armored Titan and Bertholdt from the Titans . A week later , Hange and Conny give a report to Erwin , Levi and Dot Pyxis , which reveals that the Titans that appeared within Wall Rose were the citizens of Ragako . Remembering how many died to rescue him , Eren vows to use his new power to help humanity , while Erwin is determined to learn more of the truth behind the Titans . Elsewhere , the Beast Titan looks out from atop Wall Maria , as a mysterious blonde man with glasses emerges from its back uttering the words , `` not just yet '' . </Td> </Tr> </Table> <H2> Special episodes ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Ova episodes ( edit ) </H3> For the No Regrets OVAs , see Attack on Titan : No Regrets . <P> The following bonus original video animation episodes were released alongside select volumes of the manga . </P> <Table> <Tr> <Th> No . </Th> <Th> Title </Th> <Th> Original air date </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> 3.5 </Th> <Td> `` Ilse 's Notebook : Memoirs of a Recon Corps Member '' `` Iruze no Tech\u014d - Aru Ch\u014dsa Heidan'in no Shuki - '' ( \u30a4\u30eb\u30bc \u306e \u624b\u5e33 \u2015 \u3042\u308b \u8abf\u67fb \u5175 \u56e3\u54e1 \u306e \u624b\u8a18 \u2015 ) </Td> <Td> December 9 , 2013 ( 2013 - 12 - 09 ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan=\"3\"> In the year 850 , whilst Eren and the others are in training , the Recon Corps go on a mission , with Hange deciding to pursue a Titan spotted in the forest in the hopes she can capture it .

Hange follows it to the center of the forest , where she finds it banging its head against a certain tree . The Titan turns hostile when Hange gets close to it , but Levi and the others arrive and kill it , much to Hange 's dismay . Upon inspecting the scene , they discover the decapitated body of Ilse Langnar , a soldier from the 34th Recon Corps division , resting inside of the tree , and find a notebook belonging to her lying on the ground . The notebook details Ilse 's records , as she escaped on foot after her squad was killed by Titans . She eventually became cornered by a Titan , but instead of killing her right away , it started to speak to her in the human language , calling her `` Ymir '' . Ilse attempted to communicate with the Titan , but it inevitably became hostile again and bit off her head , curiously choosing not to devour her body but instead rest it inside the tree . Having read through all of Ilse 's notes , Hange uses the notebook as leverage to convince Erwin to approve of operations to capture Titans alive and study them , before returning Ilse 's belongings to her grief - stricken family . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> 3.25 </Th> <Td> `` The Sudden Visitor : The Torturous Curse of Youth '' `` Totsuzen no Raih\u014dsha - Sainamareru Seishun no Noroi - '' ( \u7a81\u7136 \u306e \u6765\u8a2a \u8005 \u2015 \u82db\u307e \u308c\u308b \u9752\u6625 \u306e \u546a\u3044 \u2015 ) </Td> <Td> April 9 , 2014 ( 2014 - 04 - 09 ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan=\"3\"> In the year 849 , Jean returns home after two years in training .
