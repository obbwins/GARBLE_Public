The building is the home of the Cleveland Cavaliers of the National Basketball Association ( NBA ) , the Cleveland Monsters of the American Hockey League , and the Cleveland Gladiators of the Arena Football League . It also serves as a secondary arena for Cleveland State Vikings men 's and women 's basketball . </P> <P> The arena opened in October 1994 as part of the Gateway Sports and Entertainment Complex with adjacent Progressive Field , which opened in April of that year . It is named for the retail mortgage lender Quicken Loans , whose chairman and founder is Dan Gilbert , the majority owner of the Cavaliers , Monsters , and Gladiators . From its opening until August 2005 , it was known as Gund Arena , named for former Cavaliers owner Gordon Gund , after he paid for the naming rights . The Q replaced the Richfield Coliseum as the primary entertainment facility for the region and the home of the Cavaliers , and supplanted the Wolstein Center at Cleveland State University , which opened in 1990 , as the primary concert and athletic venue in downtown Cleveland . </P> <P> Quicken Loans Arena seats 20,562 people in its basketball configuration and up to 20,056 for ice hockey , making it the second - largest arena in the NBA by seating capacity . It is a frequent site for concerts and other athletic events such as the men 's and women 's basketball tournaments of the Mid-American Conference ( MAC ) , hosting the men 's tournament since 2000 and the women 's tournament since 2001 . It has also been the host venue for the 2007 NCAA Women 's Division I Basketball Final Four , opening and regional semifinal games in the NCAA Division I Men 's Basketball Tournament , and the U.S. Figure Skating Championships in 2000 and 2009 . In July 2016 , The Q hosted the 2016 Republican National Convention . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 History <Ul> <Li> 1.1 Design and operations </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 Tenants <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Current </Li> <Li> 2.2 Former </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Events <Ul> <Li> 3.1 College Sports </Li> <Li> 3.2 Other events </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 References </Li> <Li> 5 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> History ( edit ) </H2> The arena logo from 1994 to 2005 . <P> The Q was preceded in downtown Cleveland by the Cleveland Arena , a facility built in 1937 with a seating capacity for basketball of approximately 12,000 . It was best known as the site of the Moondog Coronation Ball in 1952 , widely regarded as the first rock and roll concert . Cleveland Arena was the first home of the Cavaliers in 1970 . </P> <P> The Cleveland Arena was also the home of an earlier professional basketball team , the Cleveland Rebels of the Basketball Association of America , the original Cleveland Barons ice hockey team , and hosted several games of the Cincinnati Royals of the NBA in the 1960s . By 1970 , however , Cleveland Arena was outdated and in disrepair . The Cavs played there their first four seasons . It was replaced in 1974 by the 20,273 - seat Richfield Coliseum , located in Richfield , between Cleveland and Akron . </P> <P> During the 1980s , the site of the Central Market , a fruit and vegetable market that dated back to 1856 , was selected for construction of a multi-purpose domed stadium for the Cleveland Browns and Cleveland Indians , but the ballot measure to fund it was defeated by voters . The market site was acquired in 1985 and cleared in 1987 in a continued push for new downtown sports facilities by city and business leaders . In 1990 , voters approved a sin tax on alcohol and tobacco products in Cuyahoga County to fund the Gateway Sports and Entertainment Complex , which includes the Q and adjacent Progressive Field . Construction began in 1992 with the ballpark opening in April 1994 and the arena in October 1994 . The arena opened with a concert by Billy Joel on October 17 , 1994 . The Cavaliers played their first regular - season game in the arena a few weeks later , a loss to the Houston Rockets , on November 8 , 1994 . </P> <P> As part of his purchase of the team and the arena naming rights in 2005 , Dan Gilbert , owner of Quicken Loans , funded renovations of the arena , which included installing new wine - colored seats , state - of - the - art scoreboards , video systems , and sound systems , new arena graphics and signage , and upgrades to security , locker rooms , and the suites , all of which were in place for the start of the Cavaliers 2005 -- 2006 season , except for the seats , which were replaced a few sections at a time . </P> <P> Gilbert purchased the then - inactive Utah Grizzlies franchise of the American Hockey League on May 16 , 2006 , and announced that it would move to Quicken Loans Arena to replace the departed Cleveland Barons . The team name was announced as the Lake Erie Monsters on January 25 , 2007 , and began play in the 2007 -- 08 season . The Lake Erie Monsters changed their name to the Cleveland Monsters on August 9 , 2016 . </P> <P> The Las Vegas Gladiators of the Arena Football League announced on October 16 , 2007 , that they would move to Quicken Loans Arena , becoming the Cleveland Gladiators . </P> <P> Plans for a two - year , $140 million renovation project to begin in 2017 were released by the Cavaliers in December 2016 . The project calls for an increase in the square footage of the concourses and open areas , along with upgrades throughout the building . It is scheduled to be completed by late 2019 . </P> <H3> Design and operations ( edit ) </H3> <P> The arena seats 20,562 for basketball , with 2,000 club seats and 88 luxury suites . Seating is divided into three levels , with two main levels of suites and five `` platinum suites '' on the event level . Around the seating there are two main concourses , one on the ground level to access the 100 level seating and 32 lower suites , and an upper concourse for the top 200 level seating . The lower concourse also includes the ticket office and the two - level main team shop . In between is the club level , which provides access to the 60 upper suites and club seating . Also on the club level is an auxiliary gym , which was used by the Cavaliers as their main practice court until the opening of the Cleveland Clinic Courts practice facility in 2007 . </P> <P> In the hockey and arena football configuration , capacity is 20,056 . During most Monsters games , the upper - level seating is closed and covered by a large curtain , reducing capacity to 10,025 . In the basketball configuration , when the upper level seating is closed , capacity is listed at 11,751. 60 % of the seating is located in the lower two levels . </P> The scoreboard with flames during player introductions in 2014 <P> The main scoreboard at The Q , nicknamed Humongotron , is the second largest scoreboard used in an NBA arena . It was installed in October 2014 after Cavs owner Dan Gilbert had seen a similar scoreboard at the Toyota Center in Houston during the 2013 NBA All - Star Weekend . The scoreboard includes four large high - definition video screens with large sabers on each corner that can extend outward to shoot fire , usually as part of player introductions . The two screens facing the sidelines are 31.5 feet ( 9.6 m ) high and 56.69 feet ( 17.28 m ) wide , while the two screens facing the baselines measure 29.92 feet ( 9.12 m ) high and 33.07 feet ( 10.08 m ) wide . </P> <P> On the roof of the building is a large LED message board that measures 360 feet ( 110 m ) by 90 feet ( 27 m ) , described as the `` largest LED roof sign on the planet '' by Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert . The sign was approved by the Cleveland City Planning Commission in March 2016 with the stipulation that only the arena 's name or its naming rights sponsor can be shown . Any other use of the sign needs commission approval . The message board was installed later in 2016 and debuted in May during Game 1 of the Eastern Conference finals . </P> <P> The arena , along with neighboring Progressive Field and an adjacent parking garage , is owned by the Gateway Economic Development Corporation of Greater Cleveland , an entity made up of members appointed by the governments of the city of Cleveland and Cuyahoga County . Gateway leases the arena to the Cavaliers , who also manage the Cleveland Monsters and the Cleveland Gladiators . Food service is managed by Aramark and includes items contributed by award - winning chef Michael Symon . Two existing restaurants were renamed in 2009 after Symon 's bar - bistros `` Bar Symon '' and `` The B - Spot '' , and some of his signature dishes are available as suite catering offerings . </P> <P> In March 2017 , in partnership with the non-profit organization KultureCity , Quicken Loans Arena officially introduced the availability of accommodations during all events for guests with hypersensitivity needs , such as attendees with autism spectrum disorders . This includes staff training , free `` sensory bags '' with headphones , a blanket , and other items geared towards attendees with sensory needs , as well as a sensory room and exemptions from re-entry policies if they are overwhelmed by the environment . The arena became the first in the NBA to be certified by KultureCity as being `` sensory inclusive '' . </P> <H2> Tenants ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Current ( edit ) </H3> <P> As home of the Cavaliers , Monsters , and Gladiators , The Q has hosted a number of notable events for each team , including playoff and championship games . Through the 2015 -- 16 season , the Cavs have hosted playoff games in 10 of their 22 seasons at The Q , including games three and four of the 2007 NBA Finals , and games three , four , and six of the 2015 and 2016 Finals . The arena was also the site of the 1997 NBA All - Star Game , which celebrated the 50th anniversary of the founding of the NBA . </P> <P> The Gladiators have qualified for the Arena Football League playoffs in four of their seven seasons in Cleveland through 2015 , and hosted playoff games in 2008 , 2011 , and 2014 . During the 2014 season , the team finished 15 -- 1 overall and advanced to ArenaBowl XXVII , which hosted at Quicken Loans Arena . The game drew 18,410 fans and was held at the same time as a Cleveland Browns home preseason game at FirstEnergy Stadium , and a Cleveland Indians home game at adjacent Progressive Field . </P> <P> The Monsters made their playoff debut in 2011 and returned to the playoffs in 2016 . In the 2016 Calder Cup playoffs , the team advanced to the Calder Cup final and swept the Hershey Bears in four games for their first Calder Cup in franchise history . Games three and four were held at The Q. Game four , held on June 11 , was a sell - out and drew 19,665 fans , which set a record for largest crowd to ever see a professional hockey game in the state of Ohio and the second - largest postseason crowd in American Hockey League history . </P> <H3> Former ( edit ) </H3> <P> Quicken Loans Arena has been home to other franchises that have either relocated or folded . When it opened in 1994 , in addition to being home of the Cavaliers , it was also the home arena for the Cleveland Lumberjacks of the International Hockey League ( IHL ) . The Lumberjacks played at the arena until 2001 when the team folded along with the IHL . Later that year a new incarnation of the Cleveland Barons , who played in the American Hockey League , began play and were tenants at the arena until 2006 when the team moved to Worcester , Massachusetts . </P> <P> Two women 's professional teams have also called the arena home . From 1997 to 2003 , the Cleveland Rockers , one of the eight charter members of the Women 's National Basketball Association ( WNBA ) , played at The Q. The team folded after the 2003 WNBA season because the Gunds , who still owned the Cavs at that point , no longer wished to operate the Rockers franchise and a new ownership group could not be obtained . The Cleveland Crush of the Lingerie Football League played at The Q for their 2011 -- 12 and 2012 -- 13 seasons before moving to Toledo , Ohio , in late 2013 . </P> <H2> Events ( edit ) </H2> <H3> College Sports ( edit ) </H3> <P> In addition to its professional sports tenants , The Q has hosted a number of intercollegiate sporting events . It has been home to the Mid-American Conference ( MAC ) Men 's Basketball Tournament since 2000 and the MAC MAC Women 's Basketball Tournament since 2001 . `` MAC Madness '' , as it is known , has become a strong draw for the arena . The men 's semifinal and championship games routinely draw 10,000 - 15,000 attendees . In addition , Quicken Loans Arena has served as a host for games of the NCAA Men 's Division I Basketball Championship , hosting early round games in 2011 and regional semifinal and final games in 2015 . The Q has also hosted games for the NCAA Women 's Division I Basketball Championship , hosting regional semifinals and finals for the 2006 tournament and the Final Four and national championship game of the 2007 tournament . </P> <P> In 2015 , it was announced that arena management and Cleveland State University came to an agreement where select CSU Vikings men 's and women 's basketball games would take place at The Q , while Quicken Loans Arena would essentially take over operations of the Wolstein Center ( CSU 's primary home arena ) , being in charge of promoting and booking events at the venue . </P> A view from inside the arena . <H3> Other events ( edit ) </H3> <P> In addition to team sports , The Q has hosted a number of other events , including the 2000 and 2009 U.S. Figure Skating Championships along with professional wrestling broadcasts for Raw and SmackDown , and numerous WWE pay -- per -- view events : </P> <Ul> <Li> SummerSlam ( 1996 ) - headlined by Shawn Michaels vs. Vader for the WWF Championship </Li> <Li> No Mercy ( 1999 ) - headlined by Triple H vs. Stone Cold Steve Austin for the WWF Championship </Li> <Li> Invasion ( 2001 ) - headlined by Team Alliance vs. Team WWF . </Li> <Li> Survivor Series ( 2004 ) - headlined by Team Orton vs. Team Triple H </Li> <Li> Unforgiven ( 2008 ) - headlined by the first ever Championship Scramble matches . </Li> <Li> TLC : Tables , Ladders and Chairs ( 2014 ) - headlined by Bray Wyatt vs. Dean Ambrose in a TLC match . </Li> <Li> Fastlane ( 2016 ) - headlined by Brock Lesnar vs. Roman Reigns vs. Dean Ambrose in a Triple Threat match for the # 1 contender for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania 32 . </Li> </Ul> <P> LeBron James gathered almost 20,000 people at the arena on October 29 , 2008 , for a viewing of Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama 's 30 - minute American Stories , American Solutions television advertisement . It was shown on a large screen above the stage , where Jay - Z later held a free concert . </P> <P> Quicken Loans Arena was selected in July 2014 as the host site for the 2016 Republican National Convention . The arena hosted the first Republican presidential debate of the 2016 election , aired by Fox News Channel , on August 6 , 2015 . The convention was held July 18 -- 21 , 2016 . </P> <P> Cleveland - area native Stipe Miocic defended his heavyweight championship at UFC 203 , which was held at The Q on September 10 , 2016 . </P> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis Community Development Project . `` Consumer Price Index ( estimate ) 1800 -- '' .
