It was the band 's first and most successful single , released in late - 1971 in Europe and early - 1972 in the US , and topped the charts in several countries . It was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Development </Li> <Li> 2 Composition </Li> <Li> 3 Reception </Li> <Li> 4 Personnel </Li> <Li> 5 In popular culture <Ul> <Li> 5.1 Soundtrack appearances </Li> <Li> 5.2 Musical references </Li> <Li> 5.3 Other references to the song </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 6 Charts </Li> <Li> 7 References </Li> <Li> 8 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Development ( edit ) </H2> <P> America 's self - titled debut album was released initially in Europe , without `` A Horse with No Name , '' and achieved only moderate success . Originally called `` Desert Song '' , `` Horse '' was written while the band was staying at the home studio of musician Arthur Brown , near Puddletown , Dorset . The first two demos were recorded there , by Jeff Dexter and Dennis Elliott , and were intended to capture the feel of the hot , dry desert that had been depicted at the studio from a Salvador Dal\u00ed painting , and the strange horse that had ridden out of an M.C. Escher picture . Writer Dewey Bunnell also says he remembered his childhood travels through the Arizona and New Mexico desert when his family lived at Vandenberg Air Force Base . </P> <P> Trying to find a song that would be popular in both the United States and Europe , Warner Brothers was reluctant to release Beckley 's `` I Need You '' ballad as the first single from America . The label asked the band if it had any other material , then arranged for America to record four more songs at Morgan Studios , Willesden in London . `` A Horse with No Name '' was released as the featured song on a three - track single in the UK , Ireland , France , Italy and the Netherlands in late 1971 . On the release `` A Horse with No Name '' shared the A-side with `` Everyone I Meet Is from California '' ; `` Sandman '' featured on the B - side . However , its early - 1972 two - track US release did not include `` Sandman '' , with `` Everyone I Meet Is from California '' appearing on the B - side . </P> <H2> Composition ( edit ) </H2> <P> `` A Horse with No Name '' was recorded in the key of E Dorian with acoustic guitars , bass guitar , drum kit , and bongo drums . The only other chord is a D , fretted on the low E and G strings , second fret . A 12 - string guitar plays an added F \u266f ( second fret , high E string ) on the back beat of the Em . A noted feature of the song is the driving bass line with a hammer - hook in each chorus . A `` waterfall '' - type solo completes the arrangement . Produced by Ian Samwell on the day of final recording at Morgan Studios , when at first the group thought it was too corny and took some convincing to actually play it . Gerry Beckley has explained in Acoustic Guitar magazine ( March 2007 ) that the correct tuning for the guitar is DEDGBD , low to high . The chord pattern that repeats throughout the entire song is : 202002 ( Em ) , then 020202 and 000202 . The tuning is unique to this song ; they did not use it on any other America song . </P> <H2> Reception ( edit ) </H2> <P> Despite the song being banned by some U.S. radio stations because of supposed drug references to heroin use , the song ascended to number one on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 , and the album quickly reached platinum status . The song charted earlier in the Netherlands ( reaching number 11 ) and the UK ( reaching number 3 , the band 's only Top 40 hit in the country ) than it did in the United States . The interpretation of the song as a drug reference comes from the fact that the word `` horse '' is a common slang term for heroin . </P> <P> The song 's resemblance to some of Neil Young 's work aroused some controversy . `` I know that virtually everyone , on first hearing , assumed it was Neil '' , Bunnell says . `` I never fully shied away from the fact that I was inspired by him . I think it 's in the structure of the song as much as in the tone of his voice . It did hurt a little , because we got some pretty bad backlash . I 've always attributed it more to people protecting their own heroes more than attacking me . '' By coincidence , it was `` A Horse with No Name '' that replaced Young 's `` Heart of Gold '' at the number 1 spot on the U.S. pop chart . </P> <P> The song has received criticism for its banal , oddly phrased lyrics , including `` The heat was hot '' ; `` There were plants , and birds , and rocks , and things '' ; and `` ' Cause there ai n't no one for to give you no pain . '' Penn Jillette asked the band about their lyrics , `` there were plants , and birds , and rocks , and things '' after a show in Atlantic City , where America opened for Penn & Teller . According to Jillette , their explanation for the lyrics was that they were intoxicated with cannabis while writing it . In a 2012 interview , Beckley disputed Jillette 's story , saying , `` I do n't think Dew was stoned .
