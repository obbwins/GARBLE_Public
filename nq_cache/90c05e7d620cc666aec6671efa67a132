Protests included entire teams linking arms or kneeling during the anthem . Three teams - the Steelers , Titans and Seahawks - did not even take to the field for the anthem . </P> <H2> Notable Deaths ( edit ) </H2> <P> The following people associated with the NFL ( or AFL ) have died in 2017 . </P> <H3> Dan Rooney ( edit ) </H3> <P> Dan Rooney was chairman and plurality owner of the Pittsburgh Steelers and one of the sons of founding owner Art Rooney , Sr. Having been officially involved with the franchise since 1960 , Rooney was a part of all six of the Steelers ' Super Bowl victories . In addition to this , Rooney was considered an active and progressive owner in the league 's operations , most famously by successfully pushing for the Rooney Rule , an affirmative action policy requiring all NFL franchises to interview persons of color for head coaching vacancies . Concurrently with his role with the Steelers , Rooney also served as United States Ambassador to Ireland from 2009 to 2014 . He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2000 , making him and his father the second father - son duo in the Hall behind Tim & Wellington Mara . Rooney died on April 13 at the age of 84 . </P> <H3> Others ( edit ) </H3> <Ul> <Li> Dave Adolph </Li> <Li> Bill Anderson </Li> <Li> Ron Billingsley </Li> <Li> Dave Brazil </Li> <Li> Kevin Cadle </Li> <Li> Bernie Casey </Li> <Li> Bill Cox </Li> <Li> Bill Fischer </Li> <Li> Tom Graham </Li> <Li> Larry Grantham </Li> <Li> Ralph Guglielmi </Li> <Li> James Hadnot </Li> <Li> James Hardy III </Li> <Li> Larry Hayes </Li> <Li> Mitchell Henry </Li> <Li> Aaron Hernandez </Li> <Li> Larry Hickman </Li> <Li> John Hilton </Li> <Li> Claude Hipps </Li> <Li> Michael Jackson </Li> <Li> Derrick Jensen </Li> <Li> Cortez Kennedy </Li> <Li> Ken Kranz </Li> <Li> Yale Lary </Li> <Li> Bob Lee </Li> <Li> Tony Liscio </Li> <Li> Eddie Macon </Li> <Li> George Maderos </Li> <Li> Mickey Marvin </Li> <Li> Clay Matthews Sr . </Li> <Li> Red Miller </Li> <Li> Paul Mitchell </Li> <Li> David Modell </Li> <Li> Tom Modrak </Li> <Li> Rod Monroe </Li> <Li> Quentin Moses </Li> <Li> Leonard Myers </Li> <Li> Tommy Neck </Li> <Li> Babe Parilli </Li> <Li> Benny Perrin </Li> <Li> Hugh Pitts </Li> <Li> Sonny Randle </Li> <Li> Len Rohde </Li> <Li> Max Runager </Li> <Li> Daniel Te'o - Nesheim </Li> <Li> Jimmy Thomas </Li> <Li> Y.A.

Previously this action was permitted as long as the leaper or hurdler did not land on other players . </Li> <Li> Include in the definition of a `` defenseless player '' receivers tracking the quarterback or looking back for the ball , including inside the legal contact ( 5 yards from the line of scrimmage ) zone . </Li> <Li> Egregious hits to the head ( similar to the `` targeting '' rule in NCAA football ) will now result in an automatic ejection . </Li> <Li> The replay control center will make the final ruling on reviewed plays instead of the game referee , although the referee can still provide input on reviewable plays . </Li> <Li> The sideline replay monitor ( the `` hood '' ) will be eliminated and replaced with a tablet on the field for the referee to review with the replay control center . </Li> <Li> Crackback blocks are now prohibited by a backfield player in motion , even if he is not more than two yards outside the tackle box when the ball is snapped . </Li> <Li> Make permanent the rule that players who commit two certain types of unsportsmanlike conduct penalties ( throwing punches / forearms / kicking , even if they do not connect , directing abusive , threatening , or insulting language toward opponents , teammates , game officials or league officials , and using baiting or taunting acts or words that may engender ill will between teams ) in the same game will be automatically ejected . </Li> <Li> Extend for a second season the change in the touchback spot after a kickoff or safety free kick to the 25 - yard line . </Li> <Li> Make illegal actions that would conserve time penalized by the option for a 10 - second runoff inside of the two - minute warning of each half or overtime ( previously this only applied in the final minute of each half or overtime ) . </Li> <Li> If a team commits multiple fouls on the same down with the intent of manipulating the game clock , the team will be penalized 15 yards for unsportsmanlike conduct and the game clock will be reset . This change was made in response to both the San Francisco 49ers and the Baltimore Ravens employing this strategy by intentionally holding the defensive players to allow the game clock to run down or run out ( in the case of the Ravens ' game vs. the Cincinnati Bengals ) during the previous season . </Li> <Li> In response to the move of Sarah Thomas from line judge to head linesman for the 2017 season , the NFL renamed the officiating position of the head linesman to `` down judge '' . </Li> </Ul> <P> The following rule changes were approved for the 2017 NFL season at the NFL Spring League meeting on May 23 , 2017 : </P> <Ul> <Li> Overtime has been shortened from 15 minutes to 10 minutes for preseason and regular season games .

Under his tenure , the Rams never finished better than 7 -- 8 -- 1 ( 2012 ) and never reached the playoffs . Fassel , the son of former NFL head coach Jim Fassel , has been the Rams ' special teams coach since 2012 ; he went 0 -- 3 in the interim . On January 12 , Washington Redskins Offensive Coordinator Sean McVay was named head coach . Sean McVay is the grandson of former San Francisco 49ers GM John McVay .

The University of Phoenix , which owns the naming rights to the Cardinals ' home field , is planning to terminate the final nine years of a 20 - year agreement , but will continue to keep its name on the stadium . </P> Denver Broncos ( edit ) <P> The stadium in which the Denver Broncos play their home games is in the process of obtaining a new naming rights agreement . Sporting goods retailer Sports Authority , which had owned the naming rights to the Broncos ' home field since 2011 , filed for bankruptcy in March 2016 , and liquidated all of their stores . The Broncos bought out the existing naming rights contract with permission from the Delaware District United States bankruptcy court in August 2016 . Three months later , the Broncos selected American talent agency WME - IMG to secure a new naming rights partner for their home field , which , to date , still carries the name Sports Authority Field at Mile High . </P> <H3> Relocations ( edit ) </H3> San Diego Chargers ' relocation to Los Angeles ( edit ) <P> On January 12 , 2017 , the San Diego Chargers exercised their option to relocate to Los Angeles as the Los Angeles Chargers . They will be joining the Los Angeles Rams as tenants in their new stadium , Los Angeles Stadium at Hollywood Park in Inglewood , California when that stadium is complete in 2020 . For the time being , the Chargers will play at the 30,000 seat StubHub Center in Carson , California , the smallest venue ( in terms of number of seats ) the league has used for a full season since 1956 . </P> Oakland Raiders ' relocation to Las Vegas ( edit ) Main article : Oakland Raiders relocation to Las Vegas <P> On January 19 , 2017 , the Oakland Raiders filed paperwork to relocate to Las Vegas , Nevada . The NFL officially approved the Raiders relocation to Las Vegas on March 27 . Unlike the Chargers , the Raiders will remain at the Oakland -- Alameda County Coliseum through at least the 2018 season ( with the 2019 season to be determined ) while Las Vegas Stadium is built , with the team moving to Nevada in 2019 or 2020 . </P> <H3> Attendance ( edit ) </H3> <P> The Los Angeles Rams , who had capped season ticket sales at 55,000 for the 2017 season , announced to have 60,128 spectators in the first home game on week 1 . However , reports estimate that spectators only filled a third of the 93,607 seats of the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum . The Los Angeles Chargers did not sell out their week 2 game at the StubHub Center , which was never expanded to 30,000 seats as originally stated and has typically had less than 26,000 fans in attendance . When the StubHub Center is at capacity , the majority of the fans present are of the opposing team . </P> <P> The Los Angeles teams were not the only ones with visible attendance problems . The San Francisco 49ers reported a Week 3 attendance total that exceeded the capacity of Levi 's Stadium , even as wide swaths of empty seats were visible in the stadium throughout the game . This followed similar sparse attendance for the 49ers ' home opener . </P> <H2> New uniforms and patches ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Twenty - five teams transitioned to Nike 's new uniform template . While most teams have just transitioned to it without any actual changes to the uniforms themselves , the New Orleans Saints , Cincinnati Bengals , and Los Angeles Rams uniforms are the most noticeable in it , fixing their collars in the process . </Li> <Li> The Detroit Lions unveiled new uniforms on April 13 , 2017 , eliminating all black elements from the uniform and logo . They added a new alternate uniform as well as a new Color Rush uniform . </Li> <Li> The Los Angeles Rams announced they would be switching their primary helmets to white and blue , similar to their Color Rush helmets . The team had fans vote on the color of their facemask , which would be white , and the design of their pants , which would be white with a blue stripe . The Rams also announced that they would explore a full rebrand in the near future . </Li> <Li> The Cincinnati Bengals will wear a patch to commemorate their 50th season . </Li> <Li> The San Francisco 49ers have altered their sleeve striping from 3 stripes to 2 stripes . </Li> <Li> The Pittsburgh Steelers will wear a patch to honor their former chairman , the late Dan Rooney , who died in April , at the age of 84 . The patch will feature a shamrock , with Rooney 's initials `` DMR '' . The last time the Steelers wore a jersey patch was when Art Rooney died in 1988 . They also donned a helmet decal to honor Chuck Noll , who died in 2014 . </Li> <Li> The Dallas Cowboys will wear blue jerseys at home on a more regular basis , marking the first time the team has worn blue jerseys at home outside of Thanksgiving games since the NFL allowed teams to wear white jerseys at home in 1964 . Despite the team 's well - documented blue jersey `` jinx '' , player preference as well as stronger retail sales of the navy blue jerseys over the white ones have prompted the team 's decision . The blue jerseys will be worn for `` high - profile '' games at AT&T Stadium . </Li> </Ul> <H2> Media ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Broadcast rights ( edit ) </H3> <P> This is the fourth season under the current broadcast contracts with ESPN , CBS , Fox , and NBC . This includes `` cross-flexing '' ( switching ) Sunday Afternoon games between CBS and Fox before or during the season ( regardless of the conference of the visiting team ) . NBC will continue to air Sunday Night Football , the annual Kickoff game , and the primetime Thanksgiving game . ESPN will continue to air Monday Night Football and the Pro Bowl . NBC will also serve as the broadcaster of Super Bowl LII . This will also be the second and final year of the current Thursday Night Football contract with CBS , NBC , and NFL Network . Along with ESPN 's simulcasted Wild Card game on ABC , ESPN announced on May 24 , 2017 , that the 2018 Pro Bowl will also be simulcast on ABC , marking the return of the Pro Bowl to the network for the first time since 2003 . For the first 9 weeks of the regular season , ESPN2 will simulcast ESPN Deportes ' Spanish - language Monday Night Football broadcasts . The simulcast will end after Week 9 due to ESPN2 's Monday - night college basketball broadcasts . </P> <P> Although never explicitly announced , the league continued the moratorium on its blackout policy , ensuring all games will be televised in the market of their home teams regardless of ticket sales . </P> <P> In over-the - top rights , Amazon Video acquired non-exclusive streaming rights to the 10 broadcast television Thursday Night Football games for $50 million . These streams will be exclusive to paid Amazon Prime subscribers , in contrast to Twitter , which held the rights to the same package in 2016 and had made those streams free to most of the world . This is the final season of the NFL 's exclusive mobile streaming contract with Verizon Wireless ; the league intends to no longer have a single exclusive partner going forward , citing changes to viewing habits . </P> <P> Verizon Communications acquired international streaming rights to an NFL London Game between the Baltimore Ravens and Jacksonville Jaguars , in a similar arrangement to the 2015 game that was streamed by Yahoo ! -- which was acquired by Verizon in 2017 . The game was streamed by Yahoo and other Verizon - owned platforms , including AOL , go90 , and Complex . NFL Network remains a partner with Twitter for online content , including its new streaming news program NFL Blitz Live . The NFL also reached a deal with Facebook in September 2017 to offer video highlights following games , and streaming programs on the service 's new Watch platform . </P> <P> This is also the final season of the NFL 's current national radio contract with Westwood One . </P> <P> Two new international digital rights deals also led to user criticism over their quality of service . In Canada , NFL Sunday Ticket shifted from distribution through television providers to the over-the - top provider DAZN , while in Europe , Deltatre took over European distribution of NFL Game Pass and launched new mobile apps . Both services faced criticism over their streaming quality , while Delatre 's app faced criticism for having bugs and initially lacking features seen in the previous version of the platform . The Independent exposed that Deltatre had also issued an internal e-mail instructing its employees to give the apps 5 - star reviews . DAZN subsequently announced that it would return to distributing Sunday Ticket through Canadian television providers in addition to their OTT service . </P> <H3> Commercials ( edit ) </H3> <P> The league has sought to reduce the number of standard commercial breaks ( media timeouts ) on its telecasts from 21 to 16 , four in each quarter , with each break extended by one additional 30 - second commercial . One particular scenario the league sought to eliminate is the `` double - up , '' in which a network cuts to a commercial after a scoring play , then airs the kickoff , and again goes to commercial before play from scrimmage resumes . Under the proposal , the league will allow networks to cut to commercial during instant replay reviews , which it had not been allowed to do before . Commissioner Roger Goodell stated that the changes are being made in an attempt to consolidate downtime between the actual game play so that there are fewer and less noticeable interruptions ; he does not expect the changes to have an appreciable impact on the real - time length of a game , which currently clocks in at slightly over three hours . </P> <P> The NFL will also , as a trial , lift its ban on the broadcast of commercials for distilled spirits during its telecasts . However , they are subject to restrictions ; a maximum of four liquor ads may be broadcast per - game , along with two per - pregame and postgame show . These ads may not contain football - related themes or target underage viewers , and must contain a `` prominent social responsibility message '' . </P> <H3> Personnel changes ( edit ) </H3> <P> Tony Romo , who announced his retirement as a player on April 4 , 2017 , joined CBS , where he replaced Phil Simms as lead color commentator . Simms and Nate Burleson , who comes over from NFL Network , will replace Tony Gonzalez and Bart Scott on CBS 's pregame show , The NFL Today . Jay Cutler also announced his retirement from professional football on May 5 and was slated to join Fox as a color analyst for its NFL coverage ; he later rescinded that announcement in August and joined the Miami Dolphins . Gonzalez will move to Fox , where he will join Fox NFL Kickoff ; upon his departure , Gonzalez stated that he wished to pursue opportunities closer to his home in California , rather than travel to New York weekly to appear on CBS . James Lofton , coming over from radio , will replace Solomon Wilcots as a CBS analyst . </P> <P> On May 31 , 2017 , it was announced that Mike Tirico would replace Al Michaels on play - by - play on NBC 's portion of the Thursday Night Football package , joined by Cris Collinsworth . The NFL had previously required this role to be filled by NBC 's lead broadcast team of Michaels and Collinsworth ; Tirico called a limited slate of games in 2016 , including several NBC - broadcast games as a fill - in for Michaels ( who voluntarily took several games off due to the increased number he was calling that season ) , and as part of a secondary team for selected games the TNF package . He will also succeed Bob Costas as the lead studio host for NBC .
