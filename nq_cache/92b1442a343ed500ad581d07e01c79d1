It was designed by Santiago Calatrava and completed in 2004 at a cost of US $23,500,000 . The bridge has become iconic for Redding . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Location </Li> <Li> 2 Sundial </Li> <Li> 3 Design </Li> <Li> 4 Budget </Li> <Li> 5 Tourism </Li> <Li> 6 In media </Li> <Li> 7 Pink Sundial Bridge </Li> <Li> 8 See also </Li> <Li> 9 References </Li> <Li> 10 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Location ( edit ) </H2> <P> The Sundial Bridge provides pedestrian access to the north and south areas of Turtle Bay Exploration Park , a complex containing environmental , art and history museums and the McConnell Arboretum and Gardens . It also forms the gateway to the Sacramento River Trail , a 35 - mile - long ( 56 km ) trail completed in 2010 that extends along both sides of the river and connects the bridge to the Shasta Dam . Drift boats of fishermen are often seen passing beneath the bridge as they fish for salmon , steelhead and rainbow trout . In the distance , Mount Shasta is barely visible . Shasta Bally is visible to the West looking upstream the Sacramento . </P> One of the markers on the dial of the sundial . The support tower of the bridge . <H2> Sundial ( edit ) </H2> <P> The support tower of the bridge forms a single 217 - foot ( 66 m ) mast that points due north at a cantilevered angle , allowing it to serve as the gnomon of a sundial ; it has been billed as the world 's largest sundial , although Taipei 101 and the associated sundial design of its adjoining park are much larger . The Sundial Bridge gnomon 's shadow is cast upon a large dial to the north of the bridge , although the shadow cast by the tower is exactly accurate on only one day in a year -- the summer solstice , June 20 or 21 . The time is given as Pacific Daylight Time . The tip of the shadow moves at approximately one foot per minute so that the Earth 's rotation about its axis can be seen with the naked eye . </P> <H2> Design ( edit ) </H2> <P> The Sundial Bridge is a cantilever spar cable - stayed bridge , similar to Calatrava 's earlier design of the Puente del Alamillo in Seville , Spain ( 1992 ) . This type of bridge does not balance the forces by using a symmetrical arrangement of cable forces on each side of its support tower ; instead , it uses a cantilever tower , set at a 42 - degree angle and loaded by cable stays on only one side . This design requires that the spar resist bending and torsional forces and that its foundation resists overturning . While this leads to a less structurally efficient structure , the architectural statement is dramatic . The bridge is 700 feet ( 210 m ) in length and crosses the river without touching the water , a design criterion that helps protect the salmon spawning grounds beneath the bridge . The cable stays are not centered on the walkway but instead divide the bridge into a major and minor path . </P> <P> The cable for the bridge totals 4,342 feet ( 1,323 m ) and was made in England . The dial of the sundial and a small plaza beneath the support tower are decorated with broken white tile from Spain . The bridge 's deck is surfaced with translucent structural glass from Quebec , which is illuminated from beneath and glows aquamarine at night . The steel support structure of the bridge was made in Vancouver , Washington and transported in 40 - foot ( 12 m ) sections by truck to Redding . </P> Sundial Bridge at night <H2> Budget ( edit ) </H2> <P> Plans for the Sundial Bridge began in the 1990s , when the city of Redding budgeted $3 million for a pedestrian bridge across the river . However , costs escalated after Calatrava 's design was chosen in 1996 , and the project became a controversial one within Redding , supported by a small group of doctors , lawyers , and other professionals but opposed by other residents who thought it would be too expensive and who favored a more `` folksy '' covered bridge design . The bridge was completed in 2004 , three years later than originally planned , at a cost of $23.5 million , with funding from the Redding - based McConnell Foundation . The expense was justified on the basis that it would increase tourism in the Redding area , which also features Shasta Dam as another architectural marvel , and it has been successful in that goal . </P> <H2> Tourism ( edit ) </H2> <P> In the fiscal year following its grand opening , Turtle Bay Exploration Park , adjacent to the bridge , saw a 42 - percent increase in its visitation . As of 2011 , Redding 's city manager stated that the bridge `` continues to generate millions of dollars worth of commerce and tourism each year '' . </P> <H2> In media ( edit ) </H2> <P> The bridge is the cover image of a general physics textbook by Serway and Jewett as demonstrating the bridge 's resisting of wind and gravity . </P> <H2> Pink Sundial bridge ( edit ) </H2> <P> In 2009 , Nor - Cal Think Pink , a non-profit organization dedicated to raising awareness of the importance of early detection of breast cancer , received approval from the City of Redding to illuminate the Sundial Bridge in pink for its Think Pink Day . The event now takes place annually . </P> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Puente de la Mujer , Buenos Aires , Argentina </Li> <Li> Samuel Beckett Bridge , Dublin , Ireland </Li> <Li> Puente de la Unidad , Monterrey , Mexico </Li> <Li> Puente del Alamillo , Seville , Spain </Li> </Ul> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ Calvan , Bobby Caina ( April 5 , 2004 ) . `` Bridge unites parkland , divides town : Some see path to future , others a misguided mess '' .
