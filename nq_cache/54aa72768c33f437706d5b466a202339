He is usually but not always , portrayed as living a comfortable , or even pampered life , while Jerry ( named `` Jinx '' in his debut appearance ) is a small , brown , house mouse who always lives in close proximity to Tom . Despite being very energetic , determined and much larger , Tom is no match for Jerry 's wits . Jerry also possesses surprising strength for his size , approximately the equivalent of Tom 's , lifting items such as anvils with relative ease and withstanding considerable impacts . Although cats typically chase mice to consume them , it is quite rare for Tom to actually try to consume Jerry . Most of his attempts are just to torment or humiliate Jerry , sometimes in revenge , and sometimes to obtain a reward from a human for catching Jerry . By the final `` fade - out '' of each cartoon , Jerry usually emerges triumphant , while Tom is shown as the loser . </P> <P> However , other results may be reached . On rare occasions , Tom triumphs , usually when Jerry becomes the aggressor or when he pushes Tom a little too far . In The Million Dollar Cat Jerry learns that Tom will lose his newly acquired wealth if he harms any animal , `` including a mouse ; '' he then torments Tom a little too much until he retaliates . In Timid Tabby Tom 's look - alike cousin pushes Jerry over the edge . Occasionally and usually ironically , they both lose , usually when Jerry 's final trap or attack on Tom backfires or Jerry overlooks something . In Chuck Jones ' Filet Meow , Jerry orders a shark from the pet store to scare Tom away from eating a goldfish , but finds himself entirely intimidated as well . Finally , they occasionally end up being friends , although within this set of stories , there is often a last minute event that ruins the truce . One story that has friendly ending is Snowbody Loves Me . </P> <P> Both characters display sadistic tendencies , in that they are equally likely to take pleasure in tormenting each other , although it is often in response to a triggering event . However , when one character appears to truly be in mortal danger from an unplanned situation or due to actions by a third party , the other will develop a conscience and save him . Occasionally , they bond over a mutual sentiment towards an unpleasant experience and their attacking each other is more play than serious attacks . Multiple shorts show the two getting along with minimal difficulty , and they are more than capable of working together when the situation calls for it , usually against a third party who manages to torture and humiliate them both . Sometimes this partnership is forgotten quickly when an unexpected event happens , or when one character feels that the other is no longer necessary . This is the case in Posse Cat , when they agree that Jerry will allow himself to be caught if Tom agrees to share his reward dinner , but Tom then reneges . Other times however , Tom does keep his promise to Jerry and the partnerships are not quickly dissolved after the problem is solved . </P> <P> Tom changes his love interest many times . The first love interest is Toots who appears in Puss n ' Toots , and calls him `` Tommy '' in The Mouse Comes to Dinner . He is also interested in a cat called Toots in The Zoot Cat although she has a different appearance to the original Toots . The most frequent love interest of Tom 's is Toodles Galore , who never has any dialogue in the cartoons . </P> <P> Despite six shorts ending with a depiction of Tom 's apparent death , his demise is never permanent ; he even reads about his own death in a flashback in Jerry 's Diary . He appears to die in explosions in Mouse Trouble ( after which he is seen in heaven ) , Yankee Doodle Mouse and in Safety Second , `` Heavenly Puss '' while in The Two Mouseketeers he is guillotined offscreen. ( except Heavenly Puss , Tom is just having a dream ) </P> <H2> Hanna - Barbera era ( edit ) </H2> <P> The following characters were introduced in the theatrical shorts that were directed by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera . </P> <H3> Spike and Tyke ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Spike and Tyke ( characters ) <P> Spike , occasionally referred to as Butch or Killer , is a stern but occasionally dumb American bulldog who is particularly disapproving of cats , but a softie when it comes to mice ( though in his debut appearance , Dog Trouble , Spike goes after both Tom and Jerry ) , and later , his son Tyke . In the shorts Jerry would often try to get Tom in trouble with Spike making him a shoo - in for a beating from the bulldog . Spike has a few weaknesses that Tom tries to capitalize upon : his possessiveness about his bone and his ticklishness . He made his first appearance in the 1942 Tom and Jerry cartoon Dog Trouble , and his first speaking role was in 1944 's The Bodyguard , where he was voiced by Billy Bletcher up until 1949 , from which point he was voiced by Daws Butler . Unlike his father Spike , Tyke does not speak . He only communicates by yapping , whimpering , growling , facial expressions and wagging his tail . In Tom and Jerry Kids , Tyke does have a speaking role in the program and is the first time that viewers were able to hear Tyke speak . Spike is very protective towards his son and gets very angry at Tom if Tyke is bothered or harmed . Although Tyke has spoken in Tom and Jerry Kids , he has laughed in one Tom and Jerry short . After Daws Butler , Maurice LaMarche , Frank Welker , John DiMaggio , Michael Donovan , Phil LaMarr and currently Rick Zieff would all perform Spike 's voice . Tyke 's vocal effects are provided by Frank Welker and speaking roles by Patric Zimmerman . </P> <H3> Butch ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Butch Cat ( Tom and Jerry ) <P> Butch ( voiced by Frank Graham , later Daws Butler due to Graham 's death ) is a black alley cat who made his first appearance in the Tom and Jerry series in the 1943 short Baby Puss , alongside Topsy and the already - established Meathead . His character , however ( along with the character of Toodles Galore ) , first appeared in the 1941 MGM short The Alley Cat , directed by Hugh Harman , Butch 's only solo cartoon . Butch is the leader of the alley cat bullies who are usually friends with Tom and help him catch Jerry . In his first appearance , however , Butch was an antagonist , tormenting Tom after Tom 's young girl owner treated him like a baby -- to the point of dressing Tom up in a diaper , a bonnet , and pink paw mittens . Thus costumed , Tom could n't help but be a figure of fun -- both for Butch and his gang , and for Jerry . Butch also battles with Tom over Toodles Galore and her affections in a couple of shorts including the 1946 short , Springtime for Thomas and the 1951 short Casanova Cat . In some cartoons , such as A Mouse in the House , Butch battles with Tom to catch Jerry . He is voiced by Maurice LaMarche in Tom and Jerry : The Magic Ring , Tony Cervone in The Karate Guard , Colin Murdock in Tom and Jerry Tales , Billy West in Tom and Jerry in War of the Whiskers , and Joey D'Auria in The Tom and Jerry Show . Butch is usually decipted as a homeless alley / street cat although in the 1956 short , Blue Cat Blues , Butch is apparently a millionaire who wins the attention of Tom 's love interest due to his immense wealth much to Tom 's dismay . Butch also appears in the Spike and Tyke cartoon Scat Cats as a house cat owned by George and Joan who in the original series own Tom . </P> <H3> Toodles Galore ( edit ) </H3> <P> Toodles Galore is an attractive white female cat , and is supposedly Tom 's usual love interest , although Tom is a reputed playboy , and had other love interests before and after Toodles . Toodles is the only love interest who appeared more than twice , and is probably the most favored . During the classic era , Tom had to compete twice against Butch and even once against Spike for Toodles 's affection , and he lost them all . In Casanova Cat , Toodles fell in love with Jerry . However , in her final short Love Me , Love My Mouse , she remained with Tom . Toodles is one of the most anthropomorphic animals in the series , with the only cat features being her tail , nose and ears . She never speaks and she rarely moves around . However , in The Tom and Jerry Show , her appearance and attitude is shown differently and she is heard speaking for the first time . </P> <H3> Mammy two Shoes ( edit ) </H3> Mammy Two Shoes in a scene from the Tom & Jerry short Saturday Evening Puss , in which her full face was shown for the first time . Main article : Mammy Two Shoes <P> From the beginning , Tom also has to deal with Mammy Two Shoes ( voiced by Lillian Randolph ) , an African - American domestic housemaid based on Hattie McDaniel . In the earliest shorts , Mammy is depicted as the maid taking care of the often opulent home in which Tom and Jerry reside . Later Tom and Jerry shorts are set in what appears to be Mammy 's own house . Her face is never seen ( with the exception of 1950s Saturday Evening Puss , in which her face is very briefly seen as she runs towards the camera ) , and she usually wallops the cat ( whom she usually addresses as `` Thomas '' ) with a broom when he misbehaves . When Mammy was not present , other humans would sometimes be seen , usually from the neck down as well . Mammy would appear in many cartoons until 1952 's Push - Button Kitty ; Mammy 's character was retired after that year following McDaniel 's death . Later cartoons would instead show Tom and Jerry living with a 1950s suburban couple . Soon after , virtually all humans in the series had visible faces. e.g. : Jeanie , Joan , the baby and George . </P> <H3> Nibbles ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Nibbles ( Tom and Jerry ) Nibbles in the 1949 theatrical short The Little Orphan <P> Nibbles ( also known as Tuffy ) is the little , blue / gray , diaper - wearing orphan mouse who is close to Jerry and appears frequently with him , especially in the comics . His cartoon debut came in the 1946 short The Milky Waif . Nibbles was later featured in the 1949 Academy Award - winning short The Little Orphan. Tom 's and Jerry 's devil appeared in three cartoons Sufferin ' Cats ! , Springtime for Thomas and Smitten Kitten . In the first of these cartoons , he served as evil coscience for Tom and in the other two for Jerry when the other fell in love . </P> <P> He is sometimes seen as Jerry 's nephew , but occasionally referred to as an orphan . In many cartoons , Nibbles is seen eating a lot ( he is always hungry ) . In his first animated appearance , he was left on Jerry 's doorstep , abandoned by his parents . Tom enjoys chasing Nibbles much as he does with Jerry . </P> <P> Though the character was created under the name Tuffy for the comics in 1942 , his early animated appearances ( from 1945 ) gave him the name Nibbles . From the 1950s , the mouse was called Tuffy on - screen as well . In Tom and Jerry : The Magic Ring , the name Nibbles was used again -- and the character was depicted as a pet - store mouse whom Jerry does n't know . </P> <P> In the Mouseketeer shorts , Nibbles speaks in French and English . He also is not Jerry 's nephew ; rather , he is the son of Fran\u00e7ois Mouse -- who does not make an appearance , but his name was given in two letters in the short Touch\u00e9 , Pussy Cat ! </P> <P> Nibbles is often mistaken for a girl due to the extaordinarily high pitched voice . He was voiced by Tara Strong in Tom and Jerry : The Magic Ring , Kath Soucie from 2010 , onwards , and Nancy Cartwright in War of the Whiskers . </P> <H3> Quacker ( edit ) </H3> Quacker at the end of That 's My Mommy <P> Another recurring character in the series was Little Quacker the duckling , who was later adapted into the Hanna - Barbera character Yakky Doodle . He appears in Little Quacker , The Duck Doctor , Just Ducky , Downhearted Duckling , Southbound Duckling , That 's My Mommy , Happy Go Ducky , and The Vanishing Duck . Quacker talks a lot compared to Tom and Jerry . His voice is a ' duck voice ' similar to Disney 's Donald Duck . In many shorts , he is the only one who speaks . He 's very trusting , even trusting Tom in many situations in which Tom wishes to eat him . He 's a friend of Jerry , but unlike Jerry harbors no hard feelings towards Tom . He appeared in The Tom and Jerry Show episode `` The Lost Duckling . '' He also got his own series of shorts on The Yogi Bear Show ( renamed Yakky Doodle ) after guesting in several Hanna - Barbera TV shows . Quacker was then used as a template for the ' Hard Luck Duck ' character starring in the titular character 's short from the What a Cartoon ! series . His What a Cartoon ! counterpart Hard Luck Duck was voiced by Russi Taylor . </P> <P> Quacker was voiced by Red Coffey in the classic shorts , and Charlie Adler in Tom and Jerry in War of the Whiskers , along with Jerry . He was named `` Duckling '' in that game . </P> <P> In Tom and Jerry Show , Quacker 's `` duck voice '' is provided by Sam Kwasman . </P> <P> In three cartoons Quacker gets separated from his mother at birth , only to reunite with her later in two of them ( Little Quacker and Just Ducky ) . In That 's My Mommy however , he is adopted by Tom . In Little Quacker , Quacker 's father , Henry makes an appearance . Because his birth is shown differently in different cartoons , he may have siblings as seen in Just Ducky and Happy Go Ducky . </P> <P> Quacker gets a girlfriend in Downhearted Duckling . </P> <H3> Cuckoo ( edit ) </H3> <P> Cuckoo is a canary that first appeared in Kitty Foiled . He also appeared in Puss n ' Toots , The Flying Cat , Life with Tom , Hic - cup Pup , Two Little Indians ( where he is red in color ) and Matinee Mouse . He is Jerry 's good friend . Despite being a little bird , he can actually carry heavy objects which is seen in only Kitty Foiled and The Flying Cat. e.g. : a bowling ball , a 2000 kilogram object . </P> <H3> Lightning ( edit ) </H3> <P> Lightning is a ginger orange cat who first appeared in the 1948 short Old Rockin ' Chair Tom as Tom 's rival . Lightning is named as such because in his first short , he practically moved at the speed of lightning . In later cartoons , Lightning often appeared as one of Tom 's alley cat buddies / rivals . Lightning has the same character design as Butch Cat , but with an orange color ( although his coloring occasionally varies from film - to - film ) . In Mucho Mouse , he speaks Spanish and is a house cat . He also appears in the Gene Deitch short Switchin ' Kitten . In the Chuck Jones short Catty - Cornered ( his final appearance ) , Lightning is portrayed with more of an orange - yellow color than before , with the additional changes of a black tail and ears . Lightning also makes several appearances in Tom and Jerry Tales , often with a red nose and , in two episodes , a bushy tail . Fans have occasionally confused Lightning with Meathead , though the two are not the same and have appeared side - by - side in two cartoons . </P> <H3> Topsy ( edit ) </H3> <P> Topsy is a grey / brown Scottish Fold kitten . He is one of Tom 's alley cat friends / foes , although in Professor Tom he befriends Jerry . He first appeared in Baby Puss ; his final appearance in the original theatrical shorts was in Scat Cats . He also appears in Tom and Jerry Tales with a more yellowish color ( similar to Life with Tom ) . In Professor Tom , Topsy is explicitly a house cat ; more often ( as in Saturday Evening Puss and elsewhere ) , he is depicted as an alley cat or a cat of unknown origin . </P> <H3> Meathead ( edit ) </H3> <P> Meathead is a brown , mangy alley ( or feral ) cat who wears a red toupee ( which is occasionally seen the same color as the rest of his fur ) . He is generally portrayed as dull - witted and first appeared in the 1943 short , Sufferin ' Cats ! , as Tom 's rival . He also appears in Baby Puss and additional shorts as one of Tom 's alley cat buddies / foes . He is known as Frankie in Heavenly Puss . In Scat Cats , his final appearance in the original theatrical shorts , he is portrayed with an all - gray color . Fans have occasionally confused Meathead with Lightning , though the two are not the same and have appeared side - by - side in two cartoons . </P> <P> After over nearly six decades of absence , Meathead re-appeared in The Tom and Jerry Show episode Cruisin ' for a Bruisin ' as a lead antagonist , while a drag version of the character named Meathelda appeared in the episode Hop to It ! Meathead also makes multiple appearances in later seasons , usually alongside Butch and other alley cats . </P> <H3> George and Joan ( edit ) </H3> <P> George and Joan are an average middle class white couple , who debuted in the 1954 short Pet Peeve . They are the new owners of Tom and Spike , but Tom likes to keep Joan company and Spike likes to keep George company . Joan is often seen either cooking or sitting on her armchair knitting or sewing a dress with Tom keeping her company . George , on the other hand , hates the monthly bills and complains that they 're too expensive . But when he 's not complaining about the bills , he is sitting in his armchair or on the sofa reading the newspaper wearing his smart purple or grey suit and Spike is keeping him company . Both George and Joan are very kind and polite towards each other and Tom and Spike . In Pet Peeve , George and Joan decided that they keep Jerry as a pet because he is easy to look after and does n't eat too much ( George and Joan do not know Jerry 's secret : He eats a lot more than Tom and Spike combined , which explains the amount of food he has in his mouse hole shown later , which mean they lost even more food compared to Tom and Spike . ) and tell Tom and Spike to leave . However , in later shorts with George and Joan , Tom and Spike still happily live with them and Jerry is not known by the couple and he is not a pet anymore . </P> <P> In some shorts , Joan appears without George , such as Mouse for Sale , The Flying Sorceress and Mucho Mouse . It could be presumed that George would be working at his office during the settings of these cartoons . </P> <P> George and Joan also appeared in four other Tom & Jerry shorts , Tom 's Photo Finish , Busy Buddies , The Vanishing Duck ( Quacker 's last short ) and Tot Watchers . </P> <H3> Jeannie and the baby ( edit ) </H3> <P> Jeannie , the babysitter of George and Joan 's baby , is an average teenager who spends much of her time talking on the phone . She is often called on to look after the baby if they 're going out . Jeannie proceeds to leap straight onto the phone just as George and Joan shut the front door , which tells us that she is very negligent about her job . Despite this , Jeannie is very kind , friendly , cheerful and rarely loses a smile -- except to scold Tom for `` bothering the baby '' , which she thinks he is doing on purpose to annoy her . Jeannie was seen in only two cartoons : Busy Buddies ( 1956 ) and Tot Watchers ( 1958 ) . Jeannie is voiced by Janet Waldo in the original shorts . The baby also appears in Tom & Jerry Kids where the babysitter is slightly younger and a redhead instead . </P> <H3> The ants ( edit ) </H3> <P> The Ants are an army of red ants who steal food as they see them . They appeared in four cartoons Cat Napping , Pup on a Picnic , Barbecue Brawl and Carmen Get It ! . They also appeared in Tom & Jerry Kids . They 're unusually heavy for their size , and their combined weight often causes many items , such as Tom 's hammock , to break . It 's unclear how or why the ants are so heavy , as they are even capable of making tables and diving boards shake as they march onto them . </P> <H3> Guardian devils ( edit ) </H3> <P> Each guardian devil for Tom and Jerry appeared in three cartoons Sufferin ' Cats ! , Springtime for Thomas and Smitten Kitten . In the first of these cartoons , one served as evil conscience for Tom and in the other one for Jerry . </P> <H3> Goldfish ( edit ) </H3> <P> A tiny goldfish who is friends with Jerry and lives in the same house as Tom and Jerry . She appeared in major roles in Jerry and the Goldfish and Filet Meow . Tom 's attempts to eat her lead to Jerry earning her affections . She also appeared in cameo roles in other cartoons namely Puss n ' Toots , The Million Dollar Cat , Casanova Cat and The Missing Mouse . </P> <H3> Muscles ( edit ) </H3> <P> Muscles is Jerry 's cousin and a mouse with incredible strength . In Jerry 's Cousin , Muscles appears to hate cats , including Tom . In Haunted Mouse , another mouse named Merlin , who is also a cousin of Jerry 's , appears as a wizard with magical abilities . Muscles ' final appearance was in Tom and Jerry : The Magic Ring , however his name was changed to Freddie and he was hostile towards Jerry . He was voiced by Paul Frees in Jerry 's Cousin and by Billy West in Tom and Jerry : The Magic Ring . </P> <H3> George ( cat ) ( edit ) </H3> <P> George is the cat counterpart of Muscles but with a personality that is in stark contrast to him . Like Muscles , George is identical to Tom ( although he is shorter ) and is his cousin . Unlike Muscles , however , George is a coward and is scared of mice . He first appeared at the beginning of Jerry 's Cousin where he gets thrashed by Muscles ( possibly the reason for his fear of mice ) . His bigger role was in Timid Tabby where he finally overcomes his fear . He also appeared in Tom and Jerry Kids where his fear seems to have re-instated even though he pretended it has not ( his name was changed to Tim in that short ) . </P> <H3> Fluff , Muff and Puff ( edit ) </H3> <P> Fluff , Muff and Puff are a trio of brown , black and orange kittens that first appeared in Heavenly Puss as adorable kittens - who were murdered by drowning - in a cameo role ( that happened in Tom 's dream ) . They also appeared in Triplet Trouble as cute but extremely mischievous kittens . They also appeared in The Tom and Jerry Show . </P> <H3> Ch\u00e9rie ( edit ) </H3> <P> Ch\u00e9rie is a brown / grey female mouse who serves as Jerry 's love interest . She first appeared at the end of Springtime for Thomas , and then later in Smitten Kitten , Touch\u00e9 , Pussy Cat ! ( only cartoon where she has an identical twin ) , Tom and Ch\u00e9rie ( the first cartoon where she is named ) and The Mouse from REMOVED_SECRET.REMOVED_SECRET. ( as a ticking time bomb set by Tom ) . </P> <H3> Toots ( edit ) </H3> <P> Toots is the name given to three different characters that have appeared infrequently . The first of these is a fluffy beige cat who appears in Puss n ' Toots and The Mouse Comes to Dinner , the latter being her only speaking role . She also has a cameo in Smitten Kitten . This version of Toots also appeared in some 1940s Tom and Jerry comics . Toots is also a different cat by the same name who appears in The Zoot Cat and in the Tom and Jerry Tales episode `` Kitty Cat Blues . '' She has occasionally and erroneously been referred to as `` Sheikie , '' but this is actually Tom 's nickname , as seen on a gift card in the cartoon . Finally Toots is the name of a mouse who serves as Jerry 's love interest in Blue Cat Blues . Toots also appeared in Love Me , Love My Mouse . </P> <H3> King of France ( edit ) </H3> <P> In some of the mouseketeer series of cartoons , Tom serves the king of France . This is an obvious reference to Louis XVI of France , who is shown as an extremely short - tempered and cruel monarch . In The Two Mouseketeers , the king guillotines Tom while in Royal Cat Nap , he orders for Tom 's decapitation . </P> <H3> Mechano cat and Robot - Mouse ( edit ) </H3> <P> Mechano cat first appeared in Push Button Kitty as Tom 's rival . Later , Mechano and Robot - Mouse are seen as a cat - like - robot and mouse - like - robot who serve Tom and Jerry ( except at the end of Advance and Be Mechanized , when they get revenge and switch roles with Tom and Jerry , as they control their minds and make them do the work ) in the three Chuck Jones outer space cartoons O - Solar Meow , Guided Mouse - ille and Advance and Be Mechanized . Mechano 's efforts to catch or trap Jerry or Robot - Mouse always backfire for Tom , except in Advance and Be Mechanized , when he succeeds to catch Robot - Mouse in the beginning . In Guided Mouse - ille , he can stand up right and have hands to use a gun with to try and blast Jerry in his mobile tank . This backfired and left Mechano with a black face , while crying in frustration . He sneaks back and promptly shoots Tom , who attempts to shoot Mechano back for his insubordination . However , the shot came out on the wrong end and Tom faints leaving Mechano laughing himself silly . He also appeared in the Tom and Jerry Tales episode `` Tin Cat of Tomorrow '' where he is named Verminator 7000 . Mechano ( called `` Robot Cat '' ) also appeared as a fighter in the video game , War of the Whiskers , and was voiced by Dee Bradley Baker . </P> <H3> The St. Bernard ( edit ) </H3> <P> The St. Bernard is a dog who first appeared in Puttin ' on the Dog and then again in The A-Tom - Inable Snowman . Unlike other dogs in the series , he is not hostile to cats and even attends Tom medically . </P> <H3> Eagle ( edit ) </H3> <P> Eagle is an Eagle that tries to steal Jerry for food from Tom . He first appeared in Flirty Birdy , then in The Tom and Jerry Show episode `` The Egg and Tom and Jerry '' ( where he is female instead of male ) and then again in Tom and Jerry Tales episode `` Bend it like Thomas . '' Eagle also appeared as a playable character in Tom and Jerry in War of the Whiskers , voiced by Rob Paulsen . </P> <H3> Lion ( edit ) </H3> <P> Lion is a lion that has switched from a tame one in Jerry and the Lion , to a nervous one in The Tom and Jerry Show episode `` The Hypochondriac Lion '' to a monster in the Tom and Jerry Tales episode `` You 're Lion . '' He is also a playable character in Tom and Jerry in War of the Whiskers where he is voiced by Jim Cummings . </P> <H3> Baby woodpecker ( edit ) </H3> <P> A baby woodpecker that first appeared in Hatch Up Your Troubles and it 's remake The Egg and Jerry where it could peck into virtually anything including Tom 's stomach , Tom 's golf club in Tee for Two or a water pipe as in Landing Stripling . Baby Woodpecker and his Mama would re-appear by making cameo appearances in The Tom and Jerry Show ( 2014 TV Series ) . </P> <H3> Uncle Pecos ( edit ) </H3> <P> Uncle Pecos is Jerry 's Cowboyish uncle who appears in Pecos Pest . He was voiced by Shug Fisher . He is known to always play with a guitar and wears a black cowboy hat that covers his eyes . He plucks one of Tom 's whiskers off to replace broken strings on the guitar . Being from Texas , he is shown to be super strong . </P> <P> Uncle Pecos returned in the Tom and Jerry Tales episode `` Cry Uncle '' , voiced by Scott McNeil . In the episode , he arrives at Tom and Jerry 's house and annoys Tom and Jerry with his music . He later leaves with Auntie Spinner in the end of the episode . Uncle Pecos made his second return in The Tom and Jerry Show , voiced by Stephen Stanton . He appears in the Season 2 episodes , `` I Quit '' , `` Uncle Pecos Rides Again '' and `` Cat - A-Tonic Mouse '' . </P> <H3> Radio ( edit ) </H3> <P> A radio with a male human voice that broadcasts music , cookery show and warnings on escaped animals , bomb threats etc . In Jerry 's Diary , the radio is shown to be anthropomorphic ( with the announcer 's name as ' Uncle Dudley ' ) but this is not the case with other cartoons . The radio 's announcements often cause troubles for Tom ( The Missing Mouse , Jerry and the Lion , Little Runaway and Down Beat Bear ) , fear ( Fraidy Cat ) , embarrassment ( Jerry 's Diary and Life with Tom ) or may be the cause of evil intentions ( Jerry and the Goldfish ) . </P> <P> Radio has been voiced by Martha Wentworth in Fraidy Cat , by Paul Frees in The Missing Mouse and Jerry and the Lion and by Joseph Forte in Jerry 's Diary . Other voice actors such as Daws Butler in Jerry and the Goldfish have been uncredited . </P> <H3> Jackass ( edit ) </H3> <P> Unlike other Tom and Jerry characters , this one is not a character per se , but rather an avatar of a popular character such as Spike . Usually , a character turns into a jackass when it is fooled such as Spike in Solid Serenade , The Framed Cat and Pet Peeve or Tom in Polka Dot Puss . In Pup on a Picnic , the word ' Sucker ' is used instead of ' Jackass ' . </P> <H2> Gene Deitch era ( edit ) </H2> <P> The following characters were introduced in the theatrical shorts that were directed by Gene Deitch in the 1960s . </P> <H3> Dewitt clinton ' Clint ' Clobber ( edit ) </H3> <P> An overweight , average height , middle - aged , bald white man became Tom 's owner in three of the thirteen cartoons in Down and Outing , High Steaks and Sorry Safari . Just like Spike the Bulldog , he has very severe anger issues and is repeatedly violent towards Tom for his actions . </P> <P> There is some debate as to whether this is the genuine Clint Clobber as the real Clint would never be an animal abuser , he was just a put - upon grouch . </P> <H3> Mad scientist ( edit ) </H3> <P> He is a mad scientist reminiscent of Frankenstein . He first appeared in Switchin ' Kitten and subsequently was the subject of a number of television episodes ( for e.g. ' Trojan Dog ' in Tom and Jerry Comedy Show ) and movies thereafter . In his first appearance , the mad scientist is the owner of Jerry ( who is also his assistant ) and has numerous cats trapped in a prison . When Jerry picks an orange cat named Lightning , the other cats flee in terror as the scientist pulls him out for his latest experiment . He switches the mind of the orange cat with that of a bulldog and presents him as his present to Jerry . </P> <H3> Thin lady ( edit ) </H3> <P> An unnamed thin white lady became Tom 's owner in Buddies Thicker Than Water . Gene Deitch opted not to use Mammy 's character in his shorts , as he felt a `` stereotypical black housekeep '' character `` did n't work in a modern context . '' Chuck Jones would also use her in The Unshrinkable Jerry Mouse and in the re-animated version of Saturday Evening Puss . She also appeared in the movie Tom and Jerry : The Fast and the Furry . Like many other early human characters , her face was never shown . </P> <H2> Chuck Jones era ( edit ) </H2> <P> The following characters were introduced in the theatrical shorts that were produced by Chuck Jones in the 1960s . </P> <H3> Tiny bulldog ( edit ) </H3> <P> This nameless mouse - sized bulldog , designed similarly to Spike the Bulldog , is Jerry 's pet dog companion in only two shorts : The Cat 's Me - Ouch and Purr - Chance to Dream . His role is similar to Spike in cartoons such as The Bodyguard , Fit To Be Tied , and Much Ado About Mousing , which is to defend Jerry against Tom . He is presumably the oldest son of Spike before Tyke , and this could be identified by his looks and personality that is similar to his father Spike . Unlike Spike and Tyke he has a big bite ( similar to those of Looney Tunes ' Tasmanian Devil ) . </P> <H3> Porpoise ( edit ) </H3> <P> A shark who tries to eat Tom and Jerry . He appears in Cannery Rodent , Puss ' n ' Boats , Filet Meow and Surf - Bored Cat . The creature 's color and species varies , in Cannery Rodent and Surf - Bored Cat it is a blue shark , while in Filet Meow and Puss ' n ' Boats it is a great white shark . </P> <P> Porpoise also appeared in the Tom and Jerry Comedy Show episode A Connecticut mouse in King Arthur 's court . </P> <H2> The Tom and Jerry Show ( edit ) </H2> <P> The following characters were introduced in the 1975 television series The Tom and Jerry Show . </P> <H3> Boo - Boo ( edit ) </H3> <P> Boo - Boo is the English sheep dog puppy of a rich lady who hires Tom and Jerry as dog walkers . He only appears in Towering Fiasco . Note that Boo - Boo chases a cat during their walk , but he accepts Tom , who is also a cat . The title Towering Fiasco is derived from Irwin Allen 's 1974 20th Century - Fox / Warner Bros. disaster movie The Towering Inferno , starring Steve McQueen and Paul Newman . The idea for the cartoon itself is based on the Tom - and - Jerry cartoon Tot Watchers . Towering Fiasco originally ended with the lady inviting Tom and Jerry to come again the next day , but after a walk during which Boo - Boo kept running into trouble they react in horror and flee . In the new version , she asks them to walk him again right now , Boo - Boo runs off , chasing a small gnat , dragging Tom and Jerry behind him . </P> <H3> Broke ( edit ) </H3> <P> A gopher that devours vegetables in Gopher Broke .
