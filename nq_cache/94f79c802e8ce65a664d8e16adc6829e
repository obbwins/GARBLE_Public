A successful attempt is worth three points , in contrast to the two points awarded for field goals made within the three - point line and the one point for each made free throw . </P> <P> The distance from the basket to the three - point line varies by competition level : in the National Basketball Association ( NBA ) the arc is 23 feet 9 inches ( 7.24 m ) from the basket ; in FIBA and the WNBA ( the latter uses FIBA 's three - point line standard ) the arc is 6.75 metres or 22 feet 1 \u2044 inches from the basket ; and in the National Collegiate Athletic Association ( NCAA ) the arc is 20 feet 9 inches ( 6.32 m ) from the basket . In the NBA and FIBA / WNBA , the three - point line becomes parallel to each sideline at the points where the arc is 3 feet ( 0.91 m ) from each sideline ; as a result the distance from the basket gradually decreases to a minimum of 22 feet ( 6.71 m ) . In the NCAA the arc is continuous for 180 \u00b0 around the basket . There are more variations ( see main article ) . </P> <P> In 3x3 , a FIBA - sanctioned variant of the half - court 3 - on - 3 game , the `` three - point '' line exists , but shots from behind the line are only worth 2 points . All other shots are worth 1 point . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 History </Li> <Li> 2 Rule specifications </Li> <Li> 3 Related concepts </Li> <Li> 4 See also </Li> <Li> 5 References </Li> <Li> 6 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> History ( edit ) </H2> <P> The three - point line was first tested at the collegiate level in a 1945 NCAA game between Columbia and Fordham but it was not kept as a rule . At the direction of Abe Saperstein , the American Basketball League became the first basketball league to institute the rule in 1961 . Its three - point line was a radius of 25 feet ( 7.62 m ) from the baskets , except along the sides . The Eastern Professional Basketball League followed in its 1963 -- 64 season . </P> <P> The three - point shot later became popularized by the American Basketball Association after its introduction in the 1967 -- 68 season . Then commissioner of the ABA George Mikan stated the three - pointer `` would give the smaller player a chance to score and open up the defense to make the game more enjoyable for the fans . '' During the 1970s , the ABA used the three - point shot , along with the slam dunk , as a marketing tool to compete with the National Basketball Association ( NBA ) . </P> The official scorer 's report showing the first made three - point field goal in NBA history . <P> In the 1979 -- 80 season , after having tested it in the previous pre-season , the NBA adopted the three - point line despite the view of many that it was a gimmick . Chris Ford of the Boston Celtics is widely credited with making the first three - point shot in NBA history on October 12 , 1979 . Kevin Grevey of the Washington Bullets also made one on the same day . </P> <P> The sport 's international governing body , FIBA , introduced the three - point line in 1984 , at a distance of 6.25 m ( 20 ft 6 in ) . </P> <P> The NCAA 's Southern Conference became the first collegiate conference to use the three - point rule , adopting a 22 - foot ( 6.71 m ) line for the 1980 -- 81 season . Ronnie Carr of Western Carolina University was the first to score a three - point field goal in college basketball history on November 29 , 1980 . Over the following five years , NCAA conferences differed in their use of the rule and distance required for a three - pointer . The line was as close as 17 ft 9 in ( 5.41 m ) in the Atlantic Coast Conference , and as far away as 22 feet in the Big Sky Conference . Used in conference play , it was adopted by the NCAA for the 1986 -- 87 men 's season at 19 ft 9 in ( 6.02 m ) , and was first used in the NCAA Tournament in 1987 . In the same 1986 -- 87 season , the NCAA adopted the three - pointer in women 's basketball on an experimental basis , using the same 19 ft 9 in distance , and made its use mandatory beginning in 1987 -- 88 . In 2007 , the NCAA lengthened the men 's three - point distance to 20 ft 9 in ( 6.32 m ) , with the rule coming into effect at the beginning of the 2008 -- 09 season . The NCAA women 's three - point distance was moved to match the men 's distance in 2011 -- 12 . American high schools , along with elementary and middle schools , adopted a 19 ft 9 in ( 6.02 m ) line nationally in 1987 , a year after the NCAA . </P> <P> During the 1994 -- 95 , 1995 -- 96 , and 1996 -- 97 seasons , the NBA attempted to address decreased scoring by shortening the distance of the line from 23 ft 9 in ( 7.24 m ) ( 22 ft ( 6.71 m ) at the corners ) to a uniform 22 ft ( 6.71 m ) around the basket . From the 1997 -- 98 season on , the NBA reverted the line to its original distance of 23 ft 9 in ( 22 ft at the corners , with a 3 inch differential ) . Ray Allen is currently the NBA all - time leader in career made three - pointers with 2,973 . </P> <P> In 2008 , FIBA announced that the distance would be increased by 50 cm ( 19.69 in ) to 6.75 m ( 22 ft 1 \u2044 in ) , with the change being phased in beginning in October 2010 . In December 2012 , the WNBA announced that it would be using FIBA 's distance , too , as of the 2013 season . The NBA has discussed adding a four - point line , according to president Rod Thorn . </P> <H2> Rule specifications ( edit ) </H2> <P> A three - point line consists of an arc at a set radius measured from the point on the floor directly below the center of the basket , and two parallel lines equidistant from each sideline extending from the nearest end line to the point at which they intersect the arc . In the NBA and FIBA standard , the arc spans the width of the court until it is a specified minimum distance from each sideline . The three - point line then becomes parallel to the sidelines from those points to the baseline . The unusual formation of the three - point line at these levels allows players some space from which to attempt a three - point shot at the corners of the court ; the arc would be less than 2 feet ( 0.61 m ) from each sideline at the corners if it was a continuous arc . In the NCAA and American high school standards , the arc spans 180 \u00b0 around the basket , then becomes parallel to the sidelines from the plane of the basket center to the baseline ( 5 feet 3 inches or 1.60 metres ) . The distance of the three - point line to the center of the hoop varies by level : </P> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Th> Arc radius </Th> <Th> Minimum distance from sidelines </Th> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> National Basketball Association </Td> <Td> 23 feet 9 inches ( 7.24 m ) </Td> <Td> 3 feet ( 0.91 m ) </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> FIBA ( also used by WNBA ) </Td> <Td> 6.75 meters ( 22 ft 2 in ) </Td> <Td> 0.90 meters ( 2 ft 11 in ) </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> National Collegiate Athletic Association </Td> <Td> 20 feet 9 inches ( 6.32 m ) </Td> <Td> 4 feet 3 inches ( 1.30 m ) </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> American High school basketball </Td> <Td> 19 feet 9 inches ( 6.02 m ) </Td> <Td> 5 feet 3 inches ( 1.60 m ) </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> A player 's feet must be completely behind the three - point line at the time of the shot or jump in order to make a three - point attempt ; if the player 's feet are on or in front of the line , it is a two - point attempt . A player is allowed to jump from outside the line and land inside the line to make a three - point attempt , as long as the ball is released in mid-air . </P> <P> An official raises his / her arm with three fingers extended to signal the shot attempt . If the attempt is successful , he / she raises his / her other arm with all fingers fully extended in manner similar to a football official signifying successful field goal to indicate the three - point goal . The official must recognize it for it to count as three points . Instant replay has sometimes been used , depending on league rules . The NBA , WNBA , FIBA and the NCAA specifically allow replay for this purpose . In NBA , FIBA , and WNBA games , video replay does not have to occur immediately following a shot ; play can continue and the officials can adjust the scoring later in the game , after reviewing the video . However , in late game situations , play may be paused pending a review . </P> <P> If a shooter is fouled while attempting a three - pointer and subsequently misses the shot , the shooter is awarded three free - throw attempts . If a player completes a three - pointer while being fouled , the player is awarded one free - throw for a possible 4 - point play . Conceivably , if a player completed a three - pointer while being fouled , and that foul was ruled as either a Flagrant 1 or a Flagrant 2 foul , the player would be awarded two free throws for a possible 5 - point play . </P> <H2> Related concepts ( edit ) </H2> <P> Major League Lacrosse features a two - point line which forms a 15 - yard ( 14 m ) arc around the front of the goal . Shots taken from behind this line count for two points , as opposed to the standard one point . </P> <P> In gridiron football , a standard field goal is worth three points ; various professional and semi-pro leagues have experimented with four - point field goals . NFL Europe and the Stars Football League adopted a rule similar to basketball 's three - point line in which an additional point was awarded for longer field goals ; in both leagues any field goal of 50 yards ( 46 m ) or more was worth four points . The Arena Football League awards four points for any successful drop kicked field goal ( like the three - point shot , the drop kick is more challenging than a standard place kick , as the bounce of the ball makes a kick less predictable , and arena football also uses narrower goal posts for all kicks than the outdoor game does ) . </P> <P> During the existence of the World Hockey Association in the 1970s , there were proposals for two - point hockey goals for shots taken beyond an established distance ( one proposal was a 44 - foot ( 13.4 m ) arc , which would have intersected the faceoff circles ) , but this proposal gained little support and faded after the WHA merged with the NHL . It was widely believed that long - distance shots in hockey had little direct relation to skill ( usually resulting more from goalies ' vision being screened or obscured ) , plus with the lower scoring intrinsic to the sport a two - point goal was seen as disruptive of the structure of the game . </P> <P> The Super Goal is a similar concept in Australian rules football , in which a 50 - meter ( 55 yd ) arc determines the value of a goal ; within the arc , it is the usual 6 points , but 9 points are scored for a `` super goal '' scored from outside the arc . To date the super goal is only used in pre-season games and not in the season proper . </P> <P> The National Professional Soccer League II , which awarded two points for all goals except those on the power play , also used a three - point line , drawn 45 feet ( 14 m ) from the goal . It has since been adopted by some other indoor soccer leagues . </P> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> 50 -- 40 -- 90 club , exclusive group of players who have made at least 50 % of two - pointers , 40 % of three - pointers , and 90 % of free throws in a season . </Li> <Li> List of National Basketball Association career 3 - point scoring leaders </Li> </Ul> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ `` Article 5 : Scoring '' ( PDF ) . 3x3 Official Rules of the Game .
