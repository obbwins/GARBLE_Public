The game went into open beta on September 16 , 2016 . The game also went into open beta on both PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on May 3 , 2017 . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Gameplay <Ul> <Li> 1.1 Champions and roles </Li> <Li> 1.2 Game Modes </Li> <Li> 1.3 Competitive </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 Reception </Li> <Li> 3 References </Li> <Li> 4 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Gameplay ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Champions and roles ( edit ) </H3> <P> Paladins provides various characters , called champions , for the players to choose during their multiplayer sessions . Each of these champions fall into one of the following categories : Front Line , Damage , Support and Flank . Being a team - based shooter , players must rely on strategy , character knowledge , coordination and teamwork in order to attain victory . Players may use VGS , along with text and voice chat to communicate . A good team will have a balanced choice of classes that will support each other during the game . </P> <Ul> <Li> Front Line : Champions who serve as the anchor of the team , holding the front and protecting their allies . With high health pools and shielding capabilities , Front Line champions excel at blocking enemy fire and disrupting enemy objective captures . </Li> </Ul> <Ul> <Li> Damage : Champions who possess reliable and consistent damage outputs or large burst damage potential . Their damage , coupled with average health pools and decent mobility , make Damage champions ideal for skirmishes and extended firefights . </Li> </Ul> <Ul> <Li> Support : Champions with high utility and healing abilities , the backbone of any team . Due to their healing capabilities that keep their allies in the fight , Support champions are invaluable allies . </Li> </Ul> <Ul> <Li> Flank : Champions who excel at traversing the battlefield and getting behind enemy lines , eliminating vulnerable key targets . While most Flank champions are relatively frail , having lower health pools than any other role , their excellent mobility and self - sustain provide them with the means of escape and survival . </Li> </Ul> <P> There are 31 champions in Paladins , 6 of which are available from the start for new players to choose . Additionally , 4 champions are also temporarily accessible for free on a fortnightly rotation . Players can permanently acquire additional champions through purchases using in - game currency . More are slated for release in 2017 . </P> <H3> Game modes ( edit ) </H3> <P> There are different gameplay modes for Paladins : </P> <Ul> <Li> Siege : The ' main ' Paladins game mode , teams are tasked first to capture the map 's central capture point and , if successful , push a payload that spawns from it to the enemy base . This mode is played in a best - of - seven format . </Li> </Ul> <Ul> <Li> Payload : An attacking team is tasked with escorting a payload through an extended railroad track to push it as far as they can , or to the end goal , while a defending team thwarts their progress . A push is halted if the both teams engage in combat near the payload and it slowly moves backwards if no one on the attacking team is nearby to push it , though push progress the team has accumulated is not lost . Once time runs out or if the payload is pushed to the destination , teams switch attack / defense roles . The winner is determined by the team that pushes the payload the furthest , with the attacking team setting the bar in the first round . If the attacking team in the second round are able to push the payload the same distance as the first team , the second wins the game . </Li> </Ul> <Ul> <Li> Survival : Teams try to outlast each other on a relatively small map with no respawning until the next round , all the while avoiding deathly fog that closes in from the outer edges of the map . The fog deals percentage - based damage of a champion 's health and negates all healing while a champion is in it , foiling long term stall tactics . The fog starts at the edge of the map , which starts closing in after a short delay until it reaches the map 's epicenter , where any surviving champion are forced to do battle . This mode is played in a best - of - six format . This game mode was removed in OB 52 . </Li> </Ul> <Ul> <Li> Co-op : A player versus environment game mode , a team of five face off against an AI - controlled team that possess extremely large health and high damaging attacks , as well as modified abilities . The objective in each PvE map vary from capturing an objective in a Siege game ( where the mode is simplified so that only capturing the point is necessary ) or a Survival game . This game mode was removed in OB 49 . </Li> </Ul> <Ul> <Li> Onslaught : Teams do battle over a large combat area in an attempt to take point control and earn points . Along with holding an uncontested presence on the control point , slaying enemy players also scores points for the team , akin to a team deathmatch . Killing an enemy scores the team 5 points , while holding control over the combat area earns the team 1 point per second . The first team to reach 400 points , or the team with the most points after 10 minutes , wins the game . </Li> </Ul> <Ul> <Li> Test Maps : An additional game mode accessible in the casual section . Players can play untested maps that may be implemented into the game and give their rating for the map . The objective for test maps vary between Siege and Onslaught , and the maps available are rotated every major patch . </Li> </Ul> <H3> Competitive ( edit ) </H3> <P> The Competitive game mode is unlocked for players once they have unlocked 12 champions and reach a player profile level of 15 . Competitive only features the Siege game mode . However , at the start of the match , players must choose their champions one by one . First one player chooses . Then , two players from the opposing team choose . Then two players from the team opposing the last choose . This continues until the last player ( from the team opposing the one that has first pick ) has a role . This challenges the teams to try and counter-build each other by specifically choosing certain champions . Competitive games also affects a player 's Competitive rating . </P> <H2> Reception ( edit ) </H2> <P> Within a week of its release on Steam , the game had attracted 800,000 downloads and was one of the top 10 most popular games by concurrent users on the service . </P> <P> In response to accusations that the game is an Overwatch clone , Hi - Rez COO Todd Harris said that `` Overwatch was not the inspiration for Paladins '' , and `` the game that deserves the most credit is Team Fortress 2 '' . </P> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ `` Champions - Official Paladins Wiki '' .
