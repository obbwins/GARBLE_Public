He is 6 feet 6 inches ( 1.98 m ) tall and plays both shooting guard and small forward . Carter is one of only seven players ever to play at least 20 seasons in the NBA . </P> <P> A high school McDonald 's All - American , Carter played three years at the University of North Carolina . While there , he twice reached the Final Four of the NCAA Tournament before being selected as the fifth overall pick in the 1998 NBA draft by the Golden State Warriors , who traded him to the Toronto Raptors . He won the 1999 NBA Rookie of the Year Award and won the Slam Dunk Contest at the 2000 NBA All - Star Weekend . That summer , he represented the United States in the Summer Olympics , winning a gold medal . </P> <P> Carter emerged as a star in Toronto , entertaining crowds with his leaping ability and slam dunks , earning him nicknames such as `` Vinsanity '' , `` Air Canada '' , and `` Half - Man , Half - Amazing '' . In December 2004 , he was traded to the New Jersey Nets , where he continued to put up big numbers . In June 2009 , Carter was traded to the Orlando Magic . In his first season with the Magic , he appeared in his first and so far only Conference Finals series . In December 2010 , he was traded to the Phoenix Suns . He joined the Dallas Mavericks in 2011 and the Memphis Grizzlies in 2014 . In 2017 , he signed with the Kings . </P> <P> Carter is an eight - time NBA All - Star .

During the 1997 -- 98 season , he was a member of new coach Guthridge 's `` Six Starters '' system that featured Antawn Jamison , Shammond Williams , Ed Cota , Ademola Okulaja , and Makhtar N'Diaye . During his sophomore and junior seasons , Carter helped North Carolina to consecutive ACC Men 's Basketball Tournament titles and Final Four appearances . He finished the 1997 -- 98 season with a 15.6 points per game average and was named second - team All - American , First - Team All - ACC , and to the fan 's guide third - annual Coaches ACC All - Defensive Team . In May 1998 , Carter declared for the 1998 NBA draft , following his classmate Jamison , who had declared earlier that spring . During his NBA career , Carter continued his coursework at North Carolina , and in August 2000 , he graduated with a degree in African - American studies . </P> <P> On January 31 , 2012 , Carter was honored as one of the 35 greatest McDonald 's All - Americans , and on February 23 , 2012 , President Obama , an avid NCAA and NBA basketball fan , gave praise to Carter at a fundraiser event , referring to Carter 's game as a `` huge treat for me ever since he 's been playing for the Tar Heels . '' </P> <H2> Professional career ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Toronto Raptors ( 1998 -- 2004 ) ( edit ) </H3> <P> Carter was initially drafted by the Golden State Warriors with the fifth overall pick in the 1998 NBA draft . He was then traded to the Toronto Raptors for the fourth overall pick , Antawn Jamison -- Carter 's college teammate and good friend . The Raptors had struggled in their first three years as a franchise . Carter was instrumental in leading the Raptors to their first ever playoff appearance in 2000 before going on to lead them to a 47 - win season and their first ever playoff series win in 2001 , advancing them to the Eastern Conference Semifinals . </P> <P> Due to the NBA lockout , Carter 's rookie season did not start until January 1999 . Carter quickly became a fan favourite with a soaring offensive game that earned him the nickname `` Air Canada '' . He won NBA Rookie of the Year Award after averaging 18.3 points and throwing down countless highlight - reel dunks . Carter ascended to full - fledged stardom in his second season -- he averaged 25.7 points per game ( fourth - highest in the league ) and lifted Toronto to its first playoff appearance in franchise history . He subsequently earned his first NBA All - Star selection and was named to the All - NBA Third Team . During the 2000 NBA All - Star Weekend , Carter showcased arguably the most memorable Slam Dunk Contest event in its history . He won the contest by performing an array of dunks including a 360 \u00b0 windmill , a between the legs bounce dunk , and an `` elbow in the rim '' dunk ( also known as a `` cookie jar '' dunk or the `` honey dip '' ) . Carter and his distant cousin Tracy McGrady formed a formidable one - two punch as teammates in Toronto during 1998 and 2000 . However , McGrady was dealt to the Orlando Magic in August 2000 , leaving Carter as the Raptors ' franchise player . It is believed that the Raptors could have won championships if McGrady and Carter stayed together in Toronto . </P> Carter with the Raptors in November 2000 <P> In 2000 -- 01 , his third season , Carter averaged a career - high 27.6 points per game , made the All - NBA Second Team , and was voted in as a starter for the 2001 NBA All - Star Game . The Raptors also finished the regular season with a then franchise - record 47 wins . In the playoffs , the Raptors beat the New York Knicks 3 -- 2 in the first round , and advanced to the Eastern Conference Semifinals to face off against the Philadelphia 76ers . Carter and Allen Iverson played in a seven - game series that see - sawed back and forth . Carter scored 50 points in Game 3 and set an NBA playoff record for most three - point field goals made in one game . Television ratings for Game 7 soared as one of the highest watched in NBC 's history for a non-finals game . As the Sixers and Raptors increased their double team pressures on Carter and Iverson respectively , the game winning shot came down to Carter who missed with 2.0 seconds remaining . Iverson said of the series in July 2011 : `` It was incredible . ( Carter ) had great games at home and I had some great games at home , but both of us were just trying to put our teams on our back and win basketball games . It is great just having those memories and being a part of something like that . '' </P> <P> In August 2001 , Carter signed a six - year contract extension worth as much as $94 million . However , Carter began showing the effects of what would become career - altering problems with his knees in the wake of his big contract . He earned a reputation as a fragile player after suffering a series of knee and hamstring injuries . </P> <P> Carter missed the final 22 games of the 2001 -- 02 regular season due to injury . He started in 60 games and averaged 24.7 points per game . On December 7 , 2001 , Carter recorded 42 points , 15 rebounds , 6 assists and 5 steals against the Denver Nuggets . He joined Charles Barkley ( 1988 ) as the only two players to have ever posted a game with 40 points , 15 rebounds , five steals and five assists , dating back to the 1973 -- 74 season , when the league officially began tracking steals . He was voted into the 2002 NBA All - Star Game , but he could not participate due to injury . Without Carter during the 2002 NBA Playoffs , the Raptors were defeated in five games by the Detroit Pistons in the first round . </P> <P> Following off - season surgery , Carter only managed 43 games during the 2002 -- 03 season . In February 2003 , Carter gave up his starting spot in the 2003 NBA All - Star Game to Michael Jordan to allow Jordan to make his final start as an All - Star . Carter played in 73 games during the 2003 -- 04 season , but the Raptors fell three games short of making the playoffs . </P> Trade to the Nets ( edit ) <P> During the 2004 off - season , general manager Glen Grunwald and the entire coaching staff were fired following the team 's failure to reach the playoffs . Carter became frustrated with the Raptors ' upper management . In particular , Carter was unhappy with Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment ( MLSE ) and Raptors president Richard Peddie . In a private meeting , Peddie reassured Carter that MLSE was serious in building a contender in Toronto and that he would pursue established players like point guard Steve Nash and center Jamaal Magloire . Carter was also given the impression that Peddie would consider Julius Erving as a serious candidate for general manager ; however , it was later disclosed that Erving was never really in the mix . Peddie instead hired Rob Babcock as general manager , whose first priority in rebuilding the Raptors was to `` establish our philosophy '' , stating `` we are not really worried about how many wins we get right away , or whether we make the playoffs within the first year or two . '' He then hired Sam Mitchell as head coach . </P> <P> Consequently , much speculation arose whether Carter wanted to be traded . The Toronto Sun reported that Carter felt misled and felt the Raptors would never be an elite team under the current MLSE structure with Peddie as Raptors president . Some fans raised money to fly a `` Keep Vince , Trade Peddie '' banner over the Air Canada Centre just before Carter 's annual charity game . When Rob Babcock was questioned about the trade speculations , he denied Carter asked for a trade but indiscreetly revealed Carter 's agent had approached him for a trade request . </P> <P> During the 2004 -- 05 season , coach Mitchell often benched Carter in the fourth quarter to emphasize the new team philosophy he and Babcock wanted players to adapt to , spurring rumors of fights between Carter and Mitchell and new point guard Rafer Alston . Carter 's trade wish was finally granted on December 17 , 2004 , when he was dealt to the New Jersey Nets . </P> <P> In his first game back in Toronto , on April 15 , 2005 , Carter was heavily booed and jeered by Raptors fans ; some fans were found burning Vince Carter jerseys , while many donned No. 15 baby bibs , ' FUVC ' T - shirts , and other merchandise that labelled Carter as `` Wince '' or as `` immature '' , alluding to Carter 's knee and ankle injuries and his dissent . Much like former Raptors teammate Tracy McGrady , Carter received such treatment for years to come in the town that once embraced him . </P> <P> In January 2005 , Carter was asked if he had pushed himself as hard as he should have in Toronto . Carter replied , `` In years past , no . I was fortunate to have the talent ... you get spoiled when you 're able to do a lot of things . You see that you do n't have to work at it . Now , with the all the injuries , I have to work harder . I 'm a little hungrier . Getting a fresh start has made me want to attack the basket . '' Though Carter 's comments were perceived by Raptors fans as his confession of quitting on the Raptors , Thompson said the comments were misinterpreted , saying , `` That boy never said to me , ' Coach , I just laid down and quit . ' ... I was embarrassed and felt awful about it for his sake , because I knew what he was communicating to me ... he was more expressing a desire of wanting to do better , as we all do . '' Despite Thompson 's defense of Carter , the Toronto Star 's Dave Feschuk in 2007 wrote that Carter `` cheated on ( the Raptors ) . He quit on the floor . '' Carter later stated his comments were misconstrued . On the eve of the Raptors -- Nets playoff series in 2007 , Carter told New York 's WFAN radio station , `` One day , maybe the fans will understand how it all went down . That 's all I can say . '' </P> <P> In November 2011 , Carter , along with his cousin Tracy McGrady and Charles Oakley , addressed the Toronto audience in an interview on Off the Record with Michael Landsberg . When asked about being booed in Toronto , Carter said , `` They watched myself and Tracy grow up . And when we left they still got to see ( us ) flourish and become ( who we are ) . For me , I looked at it as , a young child growing up into a grown man and moving on . And I get it . Leaving , hurt a lot of people . It hurt me because I tell you what ... I accomplished a lot , I learned a lot , I became the person and player of who I am today because of that experience , through the coaches , players , and everything else . I get it ... but regardless I still love the city . I have friends there and my heart is still there because that 's where it all started . '' Later in the interview , when asked about any words to the Toronto fans , Carter said , `` I appreciate the fans and whether you cheer for me , boo me , or hate me , I still love you . Toronto 's one of the best kept secrets ... puts one of the best products on the floor and one of the top places to play in . '' </P> <P> On November 6 , 2012 , in an interview with TSN Radio 1050 , Carter reiterated his love for the city and his appreciation for the Toronto Raptors organization . The next day , Sam Mitchell and Rob Babcock revealed on Sportsnet 590 , The Fan that the night before Carter was traded to New Jersey , Carter phoned Mitchell to express his desire to stay in Toronto and commit to their vision for the team . However , Babcock said it was too late and the trade had already been verbally agreed upon . Looking back on it , Mitchell feels he should have personally contacted the MLSE chairman , Larry Tanenbaum , but was reluctant because he did not want to break the chain of command . </P> <P> Raptors general manager Masai Ujiri referred to Carter in April 2014 as `` one of the symbols of the Toronto Raptors . '' To this day , Carter remains the Raptors ' all - time leader in points per game with 23.4 , having amassed 9,420 points during his \u200b 6 \u2044 - year run in Toronto . </P> Raptors ' 20th anniversary ( edit ) <P> On November 19 , 2014 , nearly a decade after the trade , as a part of the Raptors ' 20th anniversary celebration , the team paid tribute to Carter with a video montage during the first quarter of the Raptors - Grizzlies game . Leading up to the game , questions were raised about how Raptors fans would receive the planned video tribute . As the sellout crowd watched the video tribute featuring highlights of Carter 's high - flying Raptors days , what began as the usual booing turned into an overwhelmingly positive standing ovation . An emotional Carter used his warm - up shirt to wipe tears running down his face as he pointed to his heart and waved to the fans in appreciation . He later stated , `` It was a great feeling , I could n't write it any better . '' </P> <H3> New Jersey Nets ( 2004 -- 2009 ) ( edit ) </H3> Carter with the Nets in January 2006 <P> Carter was acquired by the New Jersey Nets on December 17 , 2004 , playing five seasons for them before departing in June 2009 . Carter produced some of his highest numbers with the Nets , surpassing his 23.4 points per game with the Raptors to average 23.6 points per game over his tenure in New Jersey . He missed just 11 games in his four full seasons and helped lead the Nets to three straight playoff runs between 2005 and 2007 . </P> <P> Carter joined a Nets team with Jason Kidd and Richard Jefferson as the leading players . However , the trio never got to play together at full strength during the 2004 -- 05 season . Carter and Kidd carried a shallow roster on a 15 -- 4 run to end the season to make the playoffs . </P> Carter with the Nets in March 2009 <P> In the 2005 -- 06 season , the Carter - Kidd duo co-led the Nets to 49 wins , an Atlantic Division title , and the No. 3 seed in the playoffs . Carter helped lead the Nets to the second round of the playoffs before losing to the eventual NBA champions Miami Heat in five games . Carter averaged 29.6 points , 7.0 rebounds and 5.3 assists in 11 playoff games . Carter was named an Eastern Conference All - Star in 2006 . On November 7 , 2005 , Carter threw down a very memorable dunk against the Miami Heat , over defensive stalwart , Alonzo Mourning . On December 23 , 2005 , Carter set an NBA record for the most free throws made in a quarter ( 4th quarter ) with 16 against Miami . He tied his career high of 51 points in the same game . </P> <P> In the 2006 -- 07 season , Carter was named as a reserve to the 2007 NBA All - Star Game , marking his eighth All - Star appearance . In a 120 -- 114 overtime win over the Washington Wizards on April 7 , 2007 , Carter and Kidd became the first teammates in over 18 years to record triple - doubles in the same game since the Chicago Bulls ' Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen achieved this feat against the Los Angeles Clippers in 1989 . Carter finished with 46 points , a career - high 16 rebounds , and 10 assists . Kidd finished with 10 points , tied a career high with 16 rebounds , and tied a season high with 18 assists . Carter finished the 2006 -- 07 season playing all 82 games , averaging over 25 points with a 21 PER . </P> <P> In July 2007 , Carter re-signed with the Nets to a four - year , $61.8 million contract . </P> <P> During the 2007 -- 08 season , Kidd was traded to the Dallas Mavericks . Carter was credited for becoming a leader following the All - Star break . He became captain of the Nets , and in 2008 -- 09 , he and teammate Devin Harris were the highest - scoring starting backcourt in the league . On November 21 , 2008 , Carter scored a season - high 39 points , including a game winning two - handed reverse dunk , as the Nets battled back from an 18 - point deficit to defeat the Toronto Raptors 129 -- 127 in overtime at the Air Canada Center . He hit a 29 - foot , game tying three - pointer to send the game into overtime and then scored the winning basket in the extra period . On February 3 , 2009 , Carter recorded his fifth career triple - double with 15 points , 12 assists and 10 rebounds in a 99 -- 85 win over the Milwaukee Bucks . </P> <H3> Orlando Magic ( 2009 -- 2010 ) ( edit ) </H3> Carter with the Magic in March 2010 <P> On June 25 , 2009 , Carter was traded , along with Ryan Anderson , to the Orlando Magic in exchange for Rafer Alston , Tony Battie and Courtney Lee . Orlando hoped Carter would provide center Dwight Howard with a perimeter scorer who can create his own shot -- something the Magic lacked in losing the NBA Finals to the Los Angeles Lakers . On February 8 , 2010 , he had a season - high 48 points , 34 in the second half , when the Magic rallied from a 17 - point deficit to defeat the New Orleans Hornets 123 -- 117 . Carter helped the Magic reach the Eastern Conference Finals , where they were defeated 4 -- 2 by the Boston Celtics . It marked his first and so far only Conference Finals series . </P> <H3> Phoenix Suns ( 2010 -- 2011 ) ( edit ) </H3> Carter ( right ) in January 2011 , being defended by former teammate Rashard Lewis <P> On December 18 , 2010 , Carter was acquired by the Phoenix Suns in a six - player trade with the Magic . On January 17 , 2011 , Carter recorded 29 points and 12 rebounds in a 129 -- 121 win over the New York Knicks . He reached 20,000 career points during the game , becoming the 37th NBA player to reach that plateau . </P> <P> On December 9 , 2011 , following the conclusion of the NBA lockout , Carter was waived by the Suns , meaning the team only had to fork over $4 million of the $18 million he was due for the 2011 -- 12 season . Carter had a short - lived run in Phoenix , playing 51 games with 41 starts while averaging 13.5 points while shooting 42 percent . </P> <H3> Dallas Mavericks ( 2011 -- 2014 ) ( edit ) </H3> Carter with the Mavericks in October 2012 <P> On December 12 , 2011 , Carter signed a three - year contract with the Dallas Mavericks . This move reunited Carter with former Nets teammate Jason Kidd . On April 20 , 2012 against the Golden State Warriors , Carter became the eighth player in NBA history with 1,500 3 - pointers when he made one in the closing minutes . </P> <P> While known early on in his career for his circus dunks , Carter became known for his 3 - point shooting with the Mavericks . On February 13 , 2013 , in a 123 -- 100 win over the Sacramento Kings , Carter scored 26 points to pass Larry Bird on the NBA 's career scoring list , moving him into 29th place . Carter turned aside a Sacramento rally in the third quarter by going 5 of 7 from long range and scoring 17 of Dallas ' last 21 points in the period . He ended the night with 21,796 career points for 29th on the all - time list , five ahead of Bird . He also became the 11th NBA player with at least 1,600 3 - pointers . He finished the season ranked 27th on the NBA 's all - time scoring list with 22,223 career points . His 162 3 - pointers tied his career high for 3s made in a season ( 162 - of - 397 , . 408 , with Toronto in 2000 -- 01 ) . Over the course of the season , he advanced from 17th place to 11th place on the NBA 's all - time 3 - point field goals made list ( passing Nick Van Exel , Tim Hardaway , Eddie Jones , Glen Rice , Jason Richardson and Kobe Bryant ) , finishing the year with 1,663 career 3 - pointers . </P> <P> Prior to the 2013 -- 14 season , Carter established himself as the Mavericks ' sixth man , after the departure of Jason Terry . He averaged just 10.5 points and shot 37.6 % from the field during the fist 22 games of the season due to increased responsibilities and pressure to be the team 's lone scoring punch off of the bench . He saw his numbers improve in December , averaging 12.5 points and shooting 44.3 % from the field during an 18 - game stretch . On March 16 , 2014 against the Oklahoma City Thunder , Carter raised his career total to 23,010 points , becoming the 27th NBA player to pass the 23,000 - point mark with a 3 - pointer with 2 : 17 left in the third quarter . In Game 3 of the Mavericks ' first round playoff series against the San Antonio Spurs , Carter drilled the game - winning 3 - pointer with no time remaining on the clock to give the eighth - seeded Mavericks a 109 -- 108 win and a 2 -- 1 series edge over the top - seeded Spurs . The Mavericks went on to lose the series in seven games . </P> <H3> Memphis Grizzlies ( 2014 -- 2017 ) ( edit ) </H3> <P> On July 12 , 2014 , Carter signed a multi-year deal with the Memphis Grizzlies . On November 13 , 2014 , he made a game winning alley - oop assist from the sideline to teammate Courtney Lee at the buzzer to win the game 111 -- 110 over the Sacramento Kings .
