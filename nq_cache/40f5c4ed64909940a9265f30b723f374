( edit ) </H2> <P> This is a section made to talk about the best selling artists and albums . -- Preceding unsigned comment added by 104.219. 190.70 ( talk ) 08 : 10 , 9 March 2018 ( UTC ) </P> <P> `` I do n't think it 's fair to compare such sales as they were alive . You then discriminate by age - for example , Buddy Holly could have been more successful than either one of these , he had that chance to make great sales until his death at only 21 by plane crash , thus ending his musical career at such an early stage and time - only been doing music a couple of years too - and you 're also not taking in the incredibly tedious procedures older generations had to do to sell their albums than newer generations ' technology and widespread credibility . Michael Jackson after Jackson 5 , came at a time when TV more recent than both Elvis and The Beatles , and to this respect alone , you could argue that with the amount of sales they both did , both Elvis and The Beatles are more successful than Michael Jackson . I think , also , not to include the Jackson 5 sales in with Michael Jackson 's sales as a solo artist , they are both two different times . My thoughts . '' think Michael Jackson is pretty well covered , but if anyone has any additional information about The Beatles ' or Elvis Preley 's total sales , please add any credible , sourced and relevant information you have . Also , ABBA is sometimes called the biggest selling act ever . If anyone has information to support this claim , I think adding a section about ABBA would be good . If you want to add an ABBA section , structure it that same as Michael Jackson , Beatles and Elvis . That is , heading , image , intro ( where they are from , when they were active , any records they hold , then go into detail about their sales . But I think ABBA should be the only other artist to be added to this list . I do n't want it to turn into a big long list . Only add artists if they have been claimed by many sources as being the best - selling ever and they are well known for being one of the best - selling artists ever . Please limit it to Michael Jackson , The Beatles , Elvis Presley and maybe ABBA . Otherwise , it might as well be List of best - selling music artists . Street walker 16 : 35 , 12 January 2006 ( UTC ) </P> <P> Have re-worded article , too much `` doubt '' mentioned for Elvis and The Beatles , while Jacksons entry seemed to be an essay to convert us over to all beliving he was the number 1 artist . </P> <P> Thank - you for doing that . You know , it 's not that I was trying to make Jackson look good , it 's that I knew more about the nature of his sales than the Beatles and Elvis . Sorry if it appeared otherwise . Street walker 03 : 43 , 14 January 2006 ( UTC ) </P> <P> Then it 's funny how you keep removing words such as `` sales claims '' and such like from the Jackson article , as well as the disclaimer about the WMA 's . It may also be mentioned at the top , but it is relevant to MJ , not Elvis and the Beatles . There is also a disclaimer at the top that also states sales are disputed and given by record companies , yet , that did n't stop you repeating it time and again in the articles of the Beatles and Elvis , if you 're not trying to make MJ look good and the other two look bad , well , you could have fooled me ! . </P> <P> As a matter of fact , The BJP ( Beatles / Jackson / Presley ) are the best selling artists of all time . That is the reason why we do need all objective fans ( from Beatles / Jackson / Presley ) and other fans / non fans to fill any reliable information so as to rule this wikipedia page. Readerweb 12 : 47 , 15 January 2006 ( UTC ) </P> <P> There is no ' fact ' on this at all . It is all speculation and guestimation . Why these artists have been singled out as the best sellers is because they have received awards for such ... and these awards are bogus to say the least . Without a doubt The Beatles and Elvis Presley stand supreme , but Michael Jackson is not the ' third biggest ' . Bing Crosby appears to have sold more , and so do ABBA . With Mariah Carey now having 16 number 1 hits in the US , being 2 behind Elvis , and 4 behind the Beatles , I also wonder what her true figures are . </P> <H2> So called `` sales list '' ( edit ) </H2> <P> The International Federation of the Phonographic Industry ( IFPI ) has just published its updated list of the 150 highest selling artists ever . IFPI has finally come up with a list of the top - selling acts in History . Its about time . </P> <P> The Top 9 is as follows : 01 . The Beatles 40 400,000,000 UK 60s ( 1962 - 1970 ) Rock / Pop Guinness / EMI </P> <P> 02 . Michael Jackson 14 350,000,000 US 70s - 00s ( 1979 - 2009 ) Pop / R&B </P> <P> 03 . Elvis Presley 150 300,000,000 US 50s - 70s ( 1956 - 1977 ) Country / Rock </P> <P> 04 . Madonna 16 275,000,000 US 80s - 00s ( 1984 - ) Pop / Dance and Techno </P> <P> 05 . Cliff Richard 60 250,000,000 UK 50s - 00s ( 1959 - 1969 , 1977 - 1979 , 1986 - 1999 ) Rock / Pop </P> <P> 06 . The Rolling Stones 54 ~ 250,000,000 UK 60s - 00s ( 1964 - 1981 ) Rock </P> <P> 07 . Mariah Carey 14 230,000,000 US 90s - 00s ( 1990 - ) Pop / R&B </P> <P> 08 . Elton John 43 ~ 220,000,000 UK 70s - 00s ( 1972 - 1976 , 1989 - 1991 , 1997 - ) Pop </P> <P> 09 . Celine Dion 21 220,000,000 Canada 80s - 00s ( 1990 - ) Pop Music / Pop </P> <P> Source : IFPI http://mjtkop.com/home/ http://REMOVED_SECRET/ </P> <P> It is quite intersting this . I 'm not sure whetehr we should structure the page around their list , but it could well be worth at least a mention , perhaps its own section within the page . However , I ca n't find this anywhere on the IFPI 's webiste . Indeed , the only place I can see it referred to is on madonna 's website ; I think we 'd need something more concrete Robdurbar 10 : 28 , 27 January 2006 ( UTC ) </P> <Dl> <Dd> AH , hang on a minute - I found a webiste that said ' the IFPI are the organization that provide the WMA with their figures ' ; so we 'd have the same problem as we do with their figures Robdurbar 10 : 29 , 27 January 2006 ( UTC ) </Dd> </Dl> <Dl> <Dd> This list = fake , phony MJ fans propaganda . Itisnt even an IFPI list . </Dd> </Dl> <P> Why theres so many artist missing in the list like Patti Page , Shakira , and Enrique Igleasias ? -- Preceding unsigned comment added by 112.198. 101.97 ( talk ) 04 : 52 , 12 June 2016 ( UTC ) </P> <H2> So called IFPI best selling artists of all time list probably not accurate ( edit ) </H2> <P> According to ESCTODAY ( Eurovision Song Contest Today ) which is refering to IFPI , here are the 20 ( of 150 ) best selling artists of all time ( 1 ) : </P> <Ol> <Li> 01. The Beatles 400,000,000 # 02. Michael Jackson 350,000,000 # 03. Elvis Presley 300,000,000 # 04. Madonna 275,000,000 # 05. Nana Mouskouri 250,000,000 # 06. Cliff Richard 250,000,000 # 07. The Rolling Stones 250,000,000 # 08. Mariah Carey 230,000,000 # 09. Elton John 220,000,000 # 10. Celine Dion 220,000,000 # 11. Pink Floyd 210,000,000 # 12. Led Zeppelin 200,000,000 # 13. Metallica 200,000,000 # 14. Julio Iglesias 200,000,000 # 15. Queen 180,000,000 # 16 AC / DC 180,000,000 # 17 Whitney Houston 180,000,000 # 18. ABBA 160,000,000 # 19. U2 150,000,000 # 20. The Jacksons 150,000,000 </Li> </Ol> <P> This `` independant '' Eurovision site is reliable but there is something that bothered me though . The World Music Awards is always refering to IFPI ( 2 ) so why did WMA awarded Mariah Carey as the World 's Best - Selling Female Artist of the Millennium in 2000 as she 's only number 8 and Madonna number 4 ? I do n't think Madonna has sold 50 million records since 2000 and then outsold Mariah Carey within 5 or 6 years . Anyway , WMA is keeping secret on this list , except the Beatles news on their website ( as best selling act of all time ) , why ca n't they provide the second , the third , ... ? IFPI website is just providing certifications of the year . IMO it is too conflicting for both ( WMA and IFPI ) to publish officially a list of the best selling artists of all time ( with figures ) as Music Companies and Majors wo n't probably accept it ( again , it 's my opinion ). Readerweb 20 : 23 , 24 March 2006 ( UTC ) </P> <P> I can answer the question about Mariah , according to a rep at the WMA , Madonna was offered this award first -- however they never rec . a responce from her rep ... Liz , they stated that since there was no responce they gave the award to another `` deserving '' artist . </P> <P> Madonna has sold well over the 275 million albums stated above , none of COADF is accounted for in this number . Madonna 's ablbum sales outside the USA were over 200 million in 2000 . This was stated already , not including sales in the USA . The above IFPI sales totals are proven and accurate based on the time frame of up to mid year 2005 . </P> <Dl> <Dd> Maddona has n't sold that many in reality . She'sonly sold 130 million singles and albums by 2000 . he has NOT sold another 175 million plus since then . </Dd> </Dl> <P> Hope this answers the question . </P> <P> This is the same list thats been floating around wikipedia the last couple months . It is a fake list , and IFPI currently tracking down the source of it i believe . The fact that theres no indication of its existence on IFPI 's official website should 've already rung alarm bells. -- Count Chocula 07 : 11 , 25 March 2006 ( UTC ) </P> <Dl> <Dd> Yeah , I wouldnt trust anything until it is available on the IFPI 's site itself Robdurbar 18 : 14 , 25 March 2006 ( UTC ) </Dd> </Dl> <P> i dont know who changed my opinion on the page . Elvis presley is dead , The beatles are defunct so michael jackson is the highest selling artist ALIVE AND ACTIVE 59.92. 95.181 09 : 08 , 13 May 2006 ( UTC ) paul newman </P> <P> So what ? That dose n't mean anything . Jacksons sales include that of a defunct group . Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr are both alive and active and have outsold Jackson ! 74.65. 39.59 02 : 17 , 7 July 2006 ( UTC ) </P> <P> Oh great ... if they go out and branch as solo acts then they are on their own.it is being said that michael jackson alone has sold 300 million copies as a solo act. i think we should include only tat. omit the jackson 5 part. now probing a little deeper i think we should have a seperate biggest selling page for the solo artists such as elvis presley , brooks , jackson etc . But heck with it ... its the music that matters not the sales ... to me beatles are junk ... elvis and jackson are the true kings. 59.92. 61.24 08 : 58 , 12 July 2006 ( UTC ) Paul Newman </P> <P> has AC / DC really sold more records than ABBA ? ? ? ? I do n't know , since the WMA 's are secretive about this sort of thing , I call it all into question . </P> <Dl> <Dd> The Beatles are not junk . `` Yesterday '' is much finer than `` Wanna be starting something '' by Wacko Jacko ! 74.65. 39.59 11 : 16 , 6 August 2006 ( UTC ) </Dd> </Dl> <Dl> <Dd> <Dl> <Dd> But on the other hand `` She 's Out of My Life '' is finer than `` Yellow Submarine '' ... Bab </Dd> </Dl> </Dd> </Dl> <P> Michael jckson has sold 350million and the Jacksons 150million so Michael Jackson has sold 350 + 150 = 500million = > so he is the real number one . And it 's not finished ... ( actually it is ) </P> <P> The Jacksons / Jackson 5 sold 60 million not 150 million and if you actually add up Mjs album and singles sales it comes closer to 300 million . </P> <P> UPDATE : Madonna has been confirmed by The Guinness Book of World Records and IFPI ( International Federation of Phonographic Industry ) as the top selling female artist of all time with certified sales of 182mil albums and 125mil singles , 305 mil records in total . The updated chart of the `` United World Chart '' , the tracking authority which monitors the RIAA and SoundScan , lists Madonna at # 5 in their `` All Time Best Selling Album Artist '' and she 's the only female singer on the list ( Mariah Carey , Celine Dion and Nana Mouskouri are not mentioned ) . Also , Madonna is the all time singles artist with 25 world - wide # 1 songs , more than The Beatles , Elvis Presley and Michael Jackson . She 's also the best selling singles and album artist in several markets including the USA , England , Spain , Germany , etc ... </P> <H2> List of best - selling remix albums worldwide ( edit ) </H2> <P> Even though this is kinda off topic can someone help the new list of best - selling remix albums worldwide with its structure . </P> Retrieved from ``
