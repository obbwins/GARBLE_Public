His son , Esai , was also a member of the club but had a hit placed on him by Marcus in 2008 as punishment for failing his mission . Most of his , and his gang 's , income is made through dealing heroin and methamphetamine , and prostitution . For some time , he was a prisoner in Chino , but was released some time before the beginning of Season One . </P> <P> On his colours , he wears patches reading `` Los Asesinos de Dios '' ( Spanish for `` God 's Assassins '' ) and `` Mayans Oakland '' . However , his `` President '' patch is later changed to `` El Padrino '' . He also has the Mayan Calendar tattooed on his chest . </P> <H2> Sons of Anarchy ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Season 1 ( edit ) </H3> See also : Sons of Anarchy ( season 1 ) <P> At the beginning of the first series , Marcus \u00c1lvarez and his gang broke into the Sons of Anarchy 's warehouse where they store their weapons . They stole the guns then burned the building down . The Sons of Anarchy eventually got revenge , however , by stealing the guns back and destroying a Mayans heroin factory . </P> <P> Ernest Darby , the leader of the Nordics , called a meeting with him to discuss taking out the Sons of Anarchy . He proposed that they team because ; the Nords want to sell meth in Charming but are unable to because of the SOA , and the SOA sell weapons to the Mayans ' rivals . \u00c1lvarez refused the offer but did give his backing by offering Mayan security . </P> <P> After Josh Kohn , a rogue ATF agent , sent Darby information on IRA and SOA weapon deals , he called another meeting with \u00c1lvarez . Darby told him to kill Clay Morrow and afterward , the Nords could take Charming and the Mayans could take over the gun business . Marcus then told his son , Esai , to kill both Morrow and Darby . Later , when Clay was making a deal with the IRA at a bar , the Mayans attacked but were killed before they could get to him . They simultaneously assaulted Darby 's home , but also failed to kill him . They broke in and shot a Nord footsoldier and two women , but Darby hid and escaped death . </P> <P> When Clay Morrow was arrested for questioning about the shootings , he asked his associate and corrupt cop Wayne Unser to bring \u00c1lvarez in so that they could hold a meeting a halt any further violence . Clay told him that he would begin selling weapons to the Mayans if all SOA - Mayan disputes ended in the SOA 's favour , to which he agreed . Later , one of Clay 's men was ordered to kill Esai at a Mayan gathering for retaliation for his failed assassination attempt . </P> <P> When the Mayans eventually set up a deal with the Sons in Oakland , it was attacked by the One - Niners . A shoot - out ensued , and gang members from the One - Niners and Mayans were killed , but the Sons of Anarchy escaped . \u00c1lvarez was also shot in the leg and wounded . The deal was , in fact , a set - up organized by the Niners and SOA . The Niners were supposed to attack the Mayans after the Sons had left and would keep the weapons as payment . However , they tried to take out the SOA as well . </P> <H3> Season 2 ( edit ) </H3> See also : Sons of Anarchy ( season 2 ) <P> At the beginning of Season 2 , Clay had Opie murder a member of the Mayans , who Clay had framed as the guy who murdered Donna . After Opie murdered the Mayan , he carved the Anarchy symbol in his chest as a message to the Mayans . Jax Teller dropped off the body in Mayan Territory in Oakland after shooting the gang member multiple times in the body to destroy the symbol . He then arranged the Mayan 's hands to hold up 9 fingers to implicate the One - Niners as the culprits . Alvarez later found the body and gave Clay a call asking to buy weapons . Clay turned Alvarez down on the weapons transaction , telling him that the club was still under suspicion of the ATF ; Clay then told Tig to call Laroy of the One - Niners to arrange a meeting to supply Niners with weapons so that they could defend themselves when the Mayans attacked . During the weapons transaction between SAMCRO and the Niners , the Mayans ambushed the deal and stole all the Niner 's AKs , and Bobby Elvis was shot in the shoulder during the ambush . After the ambush , Alvarez was seen making a phone call to Ethan Zobelle of LOAN telling him his intel was correct and that he owed him . Zobelle responded , `` Yes , you do , '' and then told AJ Weston that it was his friend from church on the phone . Clay blamed the whole ambush and Bobby getting shot in the shoulder on Jax , as Jax changed the plan and set the Niners up for the hit instead of leaving Anarchy symbol on the dead Mayan 's chest . </P> <P> In the episode `` Service '' , Zobelle met with Marcus Alvarez offering the Mayans the exclusive business of having their heroin distributed to all the local prisons . Alvarez is hesitant about the deal because Zobelle wants to keep 50 % of the profits , but has no choice when Zobelle tells him that he wo n't supply the Mayans with any more weapons if they do n't go along with the new arrangement . </P> <P> In the second - season finale , Marcus and the Mayans provided protection to Ethan Zobelle and Zobelle 's daughter who were attempting to flee Charming . Marcus was eventually able to convince Zobelle to leave his cigar shop , but the Mayan convoy they attempted to escape in was ambushed by SAMCRO . Marcus survived the attack uninjured and Clay spared his life . </P> <H3> Season 3 ( edit ) </H3> See also : Sons of Anarchy ( season 3 ) <P> During the season Alvarez hired a low ranked MC , the Calaveras , to help guard his shipment of heroin , with the promise to patch them over , but after SAMCRO stole them he decided not to patch them over and then returned Juice 's kutte . At the advice of Clay , Alvarez decided to drop the war between them and in return the Grim Bastards MC , a friendly club to SAMCRO , would protect Alvarez 's drug shipments . As a favor to the Mayans , Tig and Kozik killed the Calaveras member who was caught during the drive - by at Half - Sack 's wake . </P> <P> When a member of the Grim Bastards MC is found murdered and evidence points to the Calaveras , SAMCRO and the Bastards ' President T.O. Cross go to Marcus Alvarez for help . The Mayans and SAMCRO confront the Calaveras members in a park restroom and give the president of the Calaveras , Hector Salazar , the option of telling them which of his lieutenants killed the Bastards member or to die himself . He gives up his Sgt - At - Arms , who is then promptly shot in the head by the enraged T.O. A disgusted Alvarez strips Salazar of his position and kutte and then kicks him out of the Calaveras . He then appoints Salazar 's V.P as president and advises him to keep a tighter hold on his men then Salazar did . </P> <P> When Tara Knowles and Margaret Murphy are taken hostage by Hector Salazar , Salazar demands that SAMCRO kill Alvarez and retrieve $250,000 worth of Mayans MC money . Tig , Kozik , and Piney are able to convince Alvarez to play dead for 24 hours so that they can come up with a plan to get the women back . Marcus tells the Sons that the $250,000 does not exist . </P> <H3> Season 4 ( edit ) </H3> See also : Sons of Anarchy ( season 4 ) <P> He is seen at Opie 's wedding talking with Clay and thanking him for protection during their sentence .

However , Alvarez joins SAMCRO 's side when they believe the Triads are to blame for Tara 's death and they help both SAMCRO and the One - Niners deal with both the Triads and August Marks . Alvarez is shown to be fully on SAMCRO 's side when Juice approaches him offering information on SAMCRO in exchange for passage to Mexico .
