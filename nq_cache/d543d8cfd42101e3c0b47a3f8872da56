It tells the story of the fictional American small town of Grover 's Corners between 1901 and 1913 through the everyday lives of its citizens . </P> <P> Throughout , Wilder uses metatheatrical devices , setting the play in the actual theatre where it is being performed . The main character is the stage manager of the theatre who directly addresses the audience , brings in guest lecturers , fields questions from the audience , and fills in playing some of the roles . The play is performed without a set on a mostly bare stage . With a few exceptions , the actors mime actions without the use of props . </P> <P> Our Town was first performed at McCarter Theatre in Princeton , New Jersey in 1938 . It later went on to success on Broadway and won the Pulitzer Prize for Drama . It remains popular today and revivals are frequent . </P> <H2> Contents </H2> <Ul> <Li> 1 Synopsis <Ul> <Li> 1.1 Act I : Daily Life </Li> <Li> 1.2 Act II : Love and Marriage </Li> <Li> 1.3 Act III : Death and Eternity </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 Characters </Li> <Li> 3 Composition </Li> <Li> 4 Setting </Li> <Li> 5 Style </Li> <Li> 6 Production history </Li> <Li> 7 Awards </Li> <Li> 8 Adaptations </Li> <Li> 9 References </Li> <Li> 10 Further reading </Li> <Li> 11 External links </Li> </Ul> <H2> Synopsis ( edit ) </H2> Frank Craven as the Stage Manager in the original Broadway production of Our Town ( 1938 ) <H3> Act I : daily life ( edit ) </H3> <P> The Stage Manager introduces the audience to the small town of Grover 's Corners , New Hampshire , and the people living there as a morning begins in the year 1901 . Professor Willard speaks to the audience about the history of the town . Joe Crowell delivers the paper to Doc Gibbs , Howie Newsome delivers the milk , and the Webb and Gibbs households send their children ( Emily and George , respectively ) off to school on this beautifully simple morning . </P> <H3> Act ii : love and marriage ( edit ) </H3> <P> Three years have passed , and George and Emily prepare to wed . The day is filled with stress . Howie Newsome is delivering milk in the pouring rain while Si Crowell , younger brother of Joe , laments how George 's baseball talents will be squandered . George pays an awkward visit to his soon - to - be in - laws . Here , the Stage Manager interrupts the scene and takes the audience back a year , to the end of Emily and George 's junior year . Emily confronts George about his pride , and over an ice cream soda , they discuss the future and their love for each other . George resolves not to go to college , as he had planned , but to work and eventually take over his uncle 's farm . In the present , George and Emily say that they are not ready to marry -- George to his mother , Emily to her father -- but they both calm down and happily go through with the wedding . </P> <H3> Act iii : death and eternity ( edit ) </H3> <P> Nine years have passed . The Stage Manager opens the act with a lengthy monologue emphasizing eternity , bringing the audience 's attention to the cemetery outside of town and the characters who have died since the wedding , including Mrs. Gibbs ( pneumonia , while traveling ) , Wally Webb ( burst appendix , while camping ) , Mrs. Soames , and Simon Stimson ( suicide by hanging ) . Town undertaker Joe Stoddard is introduced , as is a young man named Sam Craig who has returned to Grover 's Corners for his cousin 's funeral . That cousin is Emily , who died giving birth to her and George 's second child . Once the funeral ends , Emily emerges to join the dead ; Mrs. Gibbs urges her to forget her life , warning her that being able to see but not interact with her family , all the while knowing what will happen in the future , will cause her too much pain , but she refuses . Ignoring the warnings of Simon , Mrs. Soames , and Mrs. Gibbs , Emily returns to Earth to relive one day , her 12th birthday . Emily watches with joy at being able to see her parents and some of the people of her childhood for the first time in years . However , her joy quickly turns to pain as she realizes how little people appreciate the simple joys of life . The memory proves too painful for her , and she realizes that every moment of life should be treasured . When she asks the Stage Manager if anyone truly understands the value of life while they live it , he responds , `` No . The saints and poets , maybe -- they do some . '' Emily returns to her grave next to Mrs. Gibbs and watches impassively as George kneels weeping over her . The Stage Manager concludes the play and wishes the audience a good night . </P> <H2> Characters ( edit ) </H2> <Dl> <Dt> <Dl> <Dd> </Dd> </Dl> </Dt> </Dl> <Ul> <Li> Stage Manager -- a narrator , commentator , and guide through Grover 's Corners .

In June 1937 , he lived in the MacDowell Colony in Peterborough , New Hampshire , one of the many locations where he worked on the play . It is believed Wilder drafted the entire third act during a visit to Z\u00fcrich in September 1937 , in one day , after a long evening walk in the rain with a friend , author Samuel Morris Steward . </P> <H2> Setting ( edit ) </H2> <P> The play is set in the actual theatre where the play is being performed , but the year is always 1938 . The Stage Manager of the 1938 production introduces the play - within - the - play which is set in the fictional community of Grover 's Corners , New Hampshire . The Stage Manager gives the coordinates of Grover 's Corners as 42 \u00b0 40 \u2032 north latitude and 70 \u00b0 37 \u2032 west longitude ( those coordinates are actually in Massachusetts , about a thousand feet off the coast of Rockport ) . </P> <H2> Style ( edit ) </H2> <P> Wilder was dissatisfied with the theatre of his time : `` I felt that something had gone wrong ... I began to feel that the theatre was not only inadequate , it was evasive . '' His response was to use a metatheatrical style . Our Town 's narrator , the Stage Manager , is completely aware of his relationship with the audience , leaving him free to break the fourth wall and address them directly . According to the script , the play is to be performed with little scenery , no set and minimal props . The characters mime the objects with which they interact . Their surroundings are created only with chairs , tables , staircases , and ladders . For example , the scene in which Emily helps George with his evening homework , conversing through upstairs windows , is performed with the two actors standing atop separate ladders to represent their neighboring houses . Wilder once said : `` Our claim , our hope , our despair are in the mind -- not in things , not in ' scenery . ' '' </P> <P> Wilder called Our Town his favorite out of all his works , but complained that it was rarely done right , insisting that it `` should be performed without sentimentality or ponderousness -- simply , dryly , and sincerely . '' </P> <H2> Production history ( edit ) </H2> Frank Craven , Martha Scott and John Craven in the original Broadway production of Our Town ( 1938 ) <P> Our Town was first performed at McCarter Theater in Princeton , New Jersey on January 22 , 1938 . It next opened at the Wilbur Theatre in Boston , Massachusetts on January 25 , 1938 . Its New York City debut was on February 4 , 1938 at Henry Miller 's Theatre , and later moved to the Morosco Theatre ; this production was produced and directed by Jed Harris . Wilder received the Pulitzer Prize for Drama in 1938 for the work . </P> <P> In 1946 , the Soviet Union prevented a production of Our Town in the Russian sector of occupied Berlin `` on the grounds that the drama is too depressing and could inspire a German suicide wave '' . </P> <H2> Awards ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> 1938 Pulitzer Prize for Drama </Li> <Li> 1989 Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Revival </Li> <Li> 1989 Tony Award for Best Revival </Li> </Ul> <H2> Adaptations ( edit ) </H2> Hal Holbrook as the Stage Manager in the 1977 television adaptation . <P> The play has been adapted numerous times : </P> <Ul> <Li> Our Town was first performed on radio May 12 , 1939 , on The Campbell Playhouse .
