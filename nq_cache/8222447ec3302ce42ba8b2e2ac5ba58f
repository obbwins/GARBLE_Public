Instead , Prophet Jack not only predicts the football score , and that it would hail the next day , but also that she would die in seven days , meaning the following Thursday . When his first two prophecies turn out to be correct , Kerrigan panics and again meets with Jack , asking him for another prophecy so that she can prove it wrong , which would imply uncertainty of her death . Jack tells her that there will be a relatively significant earthquake in San Francisco at 9 : 06 am ; she hopes that it will be wrong but again it also becomes reality . Now Lanie becomes sure of her upcoming death and is forced to reevaluate her life . </P> <P> The remainder of the storyline - which runs for the week of the prophecy - revolves around her attempts at introspection . She seeks consolation in her famous baseball player boyfriend Cal Cooper ( Christian Kane ) , and in her family , but finds little there . Her lifelong ambition , that of appearing on network television , begins to look like a distant dream . In her desperation , she commits professional blunders , but ends up finding support in an unlikely source : her archenemy , the cameraman Pete Scanlon ( Edward Burns ) , with whom she once had casual sex . He introduces her to a new approach to life ; to live every moment of her life and to do whatever she always wanted to do . </P> <P> Lanie implements Pete 's advice ; she moves in with Pete for a day , and he introduces her to his son Tommy ( Jesse James Rutherford ) , who lives with his mother , and they spend a whole day together with Tommy . That night they sleep together for the second time . The next day Lanie receives an opportunity for a job she always dreamed of in New York . She asks Pete to come with her , but he declines and tells her that her appetite for success and fame will never end . Lanie sadly leaves for New York . </P> <P> Pete meets Jack and tells him how wrong he is , as Lanie got the job which Jack foretold she would not get . But Jack explains that he was right as Lanie will never be able to get the job as she 'll die before it begins . He again gives a prophecy of the death of a famous former baseball player in a plane crash . Pete receives the news of the death of the baseball player as foretold by Jack , and tries to call Lanie to warn her . When he can not reach her , he flies to New York . </P> <P> Lanie - unconcerned with Jack 's prophecy - interviews her idol , famous media personality Deborah Connors ( Stockard Channing ) . Lanie realizes how petty the opening questions are and shares a heartfelt moment with Deborah live on air . The interview receives huge ratings . The network immediately offers her a position , but Lanie declines , realizing that she wants a life with Pete in Seattle . </P> <P> As she leaves the studio , a police officer gets into a conflict with a man , who shoots a bullet into the air . Pete tries to warn Lanie across the street , but she is shot in the crossfire . Luckily , Lanie survives , and Pete tells her in the hospital that he has loved her since the first time he saw her , and Lanie says she loves him , too . Later , Pete , Lanie and Tommy watch Cal 's baseball game , while Lanie ( in a voiceover ) says that one part of her has died -- the part which did n't know how to live a life . </P> <H2> Cast ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Angelina Jolie as Lanie Kerrigan </Li> <Li> Edward Burns as Pete Scanlon </Li> <Li> Tony Shalhoub as Prophet Jack </Li> <Li> Christian Kane as Cal Cooper </Li> <Li> James Gammon as Pat Kerrigan </Li> <Li> Melissa Errico as Andrea </Li> <Li> Stockard Channing as Deborah Connors </Li> <Li> Lisa Thornhill as Gwen </Li> <Li> Gregory Itzin as Dennis </Li> <Li> Veena Sood as Doctor </Li> </Ul> <H2> KOMO - TV ( edit ) </H2> <P> The majority of the movie was shot on location in Seattle , Washington although portions were filmed in downtown Vancouver .
