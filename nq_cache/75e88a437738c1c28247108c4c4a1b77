With this chaos , the totalitarian , theonomic government of `` Gilead '' establishes rule in the former United States in the aftermath of a civil war . Society is organized by power - hungry leaders along with a new , militarized , hierarchical regime of fanaticism and newly created social classes , in which women are brutally subjugated , and by law are not allowed to work , own property , handle money , or read . </P> <P> Worldwide infertility has resulted in the conscription of the few remaining fertile women in Gilead , called `` Handmaids '' , according to an extremist interpretation of the Biblical account of Bilhah . They are assigned to the homes of the ruling elite , where they must submit to ritualized rape by their male masters in order to become pregnant and bear children for those men and their wives . </P> <P> Alongside the Handmaids , much of society is now grouped into classes that dictate their freedoms and duties . Women are divided into a small range of social categories , each one signified by a plain dress in a specific color : Handmaids wear red , Marthas ( who are housekeepers and cooks , named after the biblical figure ) wear green , and Wives ( who are expected to run their households ) wear blue and turquoise . </P> <P> Econowives , the lower - class women who still have minimal agency , are a sort of mixture of all these categories , and they wear gray ( a departure from the book in which Econowives wear clothing striped with the aforementioned colors ) . Women prisoners are called Unwomen and are worked to death clearing toxic waste in the Colonies . </P> <P> Another class of women , Aunts ( who train and oversee the Handmaids ) , wear brown . Additionally , the Eyes are a secret police watching over the general populace for signs of rebellion , Hunters track down people attempting to flee the country , and Jezebels are prostitutes in secret brothels catering to the elite ruling class . </P> <P> June Osborne , renamed Offred ( Elisabeth Moss ) , is the Handmaid assigned to the home of the Gileadan Commander Fred Waterford ( Joseph Fiennes ) and his wife Serena Joy ( Yvonne Strahovski ) . Offred is subject to strict rules and constant scrutiny ; an improper word or deed on her part can lead to brutal punishment . </P> <P> Offred , who is named after her male master ( `` Of Fred '' ) like all Handmaids , was married and had a daughter , a job , a bank account , and her own name and identity in the `` time before '' , but all she can safely do now is follow the rules of Gilead in hopes that she can someday live free again and be reunited with her daughter . The Waterfords , key players in the rise of Gilead , have their own conflicts with the realities of the society they have helped create . </P> <H2> Cast and characters ( edit ) </H2> Main article : List of The Handmaid 's Tale characters <H3> Main ( edit ) </H3> <Ul> <Li> Elisabeth Moss as June Osborne / Offred , a woman who was captured while attempting to escape to Canada with her husband , Luke , and daughter , Hannah .

June advocates for Janine to be able to see the baby , and Serena agrees to ask about it for the baby 's sake . Naomi Putnam dislikes the idea , but she is overruled by her husband , Warren . Serena petitions Fred to allow the sick child to be seen by a Martha who , prior to the Sons of Jacob coup , was one of the nation 's top neonatologists . Fred denies the request , saying that whatever happens to the child must now be left to God 's will . A dismayed Serena forges Fred 's signature to a written order that transfers the Martha to the hospital for a day . Aunt Lydia tells June that she will hold her personally responsible if anything goes wrong with Janine 's visit to the hospital . The neonatologist can find no physical explanation for the child 's deterioration and can recommend no further treatment .

Jen Chaney of Vulture gave it a highly positive review , and wrote that it is `` A faithful adaptation of the book that also brings new layers to Atwood 's totalitarian , sexist world of forced surrogate motherhood '' and that `` this series is meticulously paced , brutal , visually stunning , and so suspenseful from moment to moment that only at the end of each hour will you feel fully at liberty to exhale '' . </P> <P> There was much debate on whether parallels could be drawn between the series ( and by extension , the book it is based on ) and American society during the Presidency of Donald Trump .
