Also in some versions the horse , the hound , and the horn are left out and the rhyme ends with the farmer . </P> <H2> Narrative technique ( edit ) </H2> This Is the House That Jack Built illustrated by Randolph Caldecott <P> It is a cumulative tale that does not tell the story of Jack 's house , or even of Jack who built the house , but instead shows how the house is indirectly linked to other things and people , and through this method tells the story of `` The man all tattered and torn '' , and the `` Maiden all forlorn '' , as well as other smaller events , showing how these are interlinked . </P> <H2> Origins ( edit ) </H2> <P> It has been argued that the rhyme is derived from an Aramaic hymn Chad Gadya ( lit. , `` One Young Goat '' ) in Sepher Haggadah , first printed in 1590 ; but although this is an early cumulative tale that may have inspired the form , the lyrics bear little relationship . It was suggested by James Orchard Halliwell that the reference to the `` priest all shaven and shorn '' indicates that the English version is probably very old , presumably as far back as the mid-sixteenth century . There is a possible reference to the song in The Boston New Letter of 12 April 1739 and the line : `` This is the man all forlorn , &c '' . However , it did not appear in print until it was included in Nurse Truelove 's New - Year 's - Gift , or the Book of Books for Children , printed in London in 1755 . It was printed in numerous collections in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries . Randolph Caldecott produced an illustrated version in 1878 . </P> <P> Cherrington Manor , a handsome timber - framed house in North East Shropshire , England , is reputed to be the actual house that Jack built . There is a former malt house in the grounds . </P> <H2> Syntactic structure ( edit ) </H2> <P> Each sentence in the story is an example of an increasingly deeply nested relative clause . The last version , `` This is the horse ... '' , would be quite difficult to untangle if the previous ones were not present . See the Noun Phrase for more details about postmodification of the noun phrase in this manner . </P> <H2> References in popular Culture ( edit ) </H2> Illustration by Walter Crane <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> This section indiscriminately collects miscellaneous information .

The popularity of the rhyme can be seen in its use in a variety of other cultural contexts , including : </P> <H3> In literature and journalism ( edit ) </H3> <Ul> <Li> Samuel Taylor Coleridge used it as the basis of a self - parody published in 1797 under the name Nehemiah Higginbotham . This was one of three sonnets , the other two parodying Charles Lamb and Charles Lloyd . Beginning `` And this reft house is that the which he built / Lamented Jack ! And here his malt he piled / Cautious in vain ! '' it piled together phrases from Coleridge 's serious work put to ludicrous use . </Li> <Li> An adaptation by Frederick Winsor appeared in The Space Child 's Mother Goose ( 1958 ) as `` This is the theory Jack built .

The parody is attributed to Joseph Richardson . </Li> <Li> Thomas Jefferson , prior to serving as President , first used it to criticize the broad construction approach of the Necessary and Proper Clause of the U.S. Constitution with respect to a bill to grant a federal charter to a mining company . The term was used to suggest that the expansion of federal powers under these arguments would give the federal government infinite powers . `` Congress are authorized to defend the nation . Ships are necessary for defense ; copper is necessary for ships ; mines , necessary for copper ; a company necessary to work the mines ; and who can doubt this reasoning who has ever played at ' This is the House that Jack Built ' ? Under such a process of filiation of necessities the sweeping clause makes clean work .
