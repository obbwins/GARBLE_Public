In 1862 , Frederick married Maria Best , daughter of the founder and owner of the Best Brewing Company , and in 1863 became a brewer at his father - in - law 's brewery . </P> <P> When Philip Best retired to Germany in 1867 , Pabst and Emil Schandein -- his sister - in - law 's husband and the vice-president of Best Brewery -- worked to transform the company into one of the nation 's largest brewers , capitalizing on , among other things , the Great Chicago Fire of 1871 that destroyed nineteen Chicago breweries and helped position Milwaukee as the leading beer - producing city in the United States . In 1889 , Schandein died , leaving Pabst as president and his widow , Lisette Schandein , as vice-president . In 1890 , Pabst changed the `` Best '' letterhead to `` Pabst '' and the Pabst Brewing Company officially began . </P> <Table> <Tr> <Td> `` </Td> <Td> This is the original Pabst Blue Ribbon Beer . Nature 's choicest products provide its prized flavor . Only the finest of hops and grains are used . Selected as America 's Best in 1893 . </Td> <Td> '' </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan=\"3\"> -- Quote from PBR label , referring to the award it received at the 1893 World 's Columbian Exposition . </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> The company has historically claimed that its flagship beer was renamed Pabst Blue Ribbon following its win as `` America 's Best '' at the World 's Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893 . Whether the brand actually won an award in 1893 is unclear . Some contemporaneous accounts indicate that many vendors were frustrated by the fair 's refusal to award such prizes . One account says that the only prizes awarded by the executive committee were bronze medals , in recognition of `` some independent and essential excellence in the article displayed '' , rather than `` merely to indicate the relative merits of competing exhibits '' . However , the beer had won many other awards at many other fairs -- so many , in fact , that Captain Pabst had already started tying silk ribbons around every bottle . It was a time when beer bottles were more likely to be embossed than labeled and the ribbons were likely added at great cost to Pabst . But Pabst 's display of pride was also a display of marketing savvy , as patrons started asking their bartenders for the blue ribbon beer . </P> <H3> Peak , decline , and revival ( edit ) </H3> A 1911 advertisement showing a blue ribbon tied around the bottle <P> Sales of Pabst peaked at 18 million barrels in 1977 . In 1980 and 1981 , the company had four different CEOs , and by 1982 it was fifth in beer sales in the U.S. , dropping from third in 1980 . </P> <P> In 1996 , Pabst headquarters left Milwaukee , and the company ended beer production at its main complex there . By 2001 , the brand 's sales were below a million barrels . That year , the company got a new CEO , Brian Kovalchuk , formerly the CFO of Benetton , and major changes at the company 's marketing department were made . </P> <P> In 2010 , food industry executive C. Dean Metropoulos bought the company for a reported $250 million . In 2011 , the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission forced two advertising executives to cease efforts to raise $300 million to buy the Pabst Brewing Company . The two had raised over $200 million by crowdsourcing , collecting pledges via their website , Facebook , and Twitter . In November 2014 , Eugene Kashper , an American beer entrepreneur , and TSG Consumer Partners acquired Pabst Brewing Company . In 2015 , Pabst won the `` best large brewing company of the year '' award at the Great American Beer Festival . </P> <H2> Nutritional content ( edit ) </H2> <P> A 12 US fluid ounces ( 0.35 l ) Pabst Blue Ribbon has : </P> <Ul> <Li> 144 calories </Li> <Li> 12.8 grams of carbohydrates </Li> <Li> 4.74 % alcohol by volume ( alc / vol ) </Li> </Ul> <H2> Marketing ( edit ) </H2> Pabst Blue Ribbon concession stand at Progressive Field in Cleveland . <P> The beer experienced a sales revival in the early 2000s after a two decade - long slump , largely due to its increasing popularity among urban hipsters . Although the Pabst website features user - submitted photography , much of which features twenty - something Pabst drinkers dressed in alternative fashions , the company has opted not to fully embrace the countercultural label in its marketing , fearing that doing so could jeopardize the very `` authenticity '' that made the brand popular ( as was the case with the poorly received OK Soda ) . Pabst instead targets its desired market niche through the sponsorship of indie music , local businesses , facial hair clubs ( RVA Beard League ) , post-collegiate sports teams , dive bars and radio programming like National Public Radio 's All Things Considered . The company encourages fan art to be submitted online , and is subsequently shown on the beer 's official Facebook page . </P> <H2> Pabst Blue Ribbon in popular culture ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> The beer has appeared in the films Midnight Madness , Blue Velvet , Everything Must Go and Gran Torino , and in television shows such as AMC 's Breaking Bad and South Park . </Li> <Li> The beer is referenced in the 2011 film Tucker & Dale vs. Evil . </Li> <Li> The beer is referenced in the title and lyrics of the 1973 country song Rednecks , White Socks and Blue Ribbon Beer by Johnny Russell . </Li> <Li> In the Mad Men season 2 episode , `` The Mountain King '' , Don Draper drinks a Pabst Blue Ribbon from the bottle . </Li> <Li> In South Park , Pabst Blue Ribbon is the beer preferred by character Randy Marsh .
