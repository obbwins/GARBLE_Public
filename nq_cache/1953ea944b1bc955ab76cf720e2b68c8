He then ended the Gunners ' barren goal - scoring run in the Premier League with the opener against AFC Bournemouth in a 2 -- 0 away win on 7 February . \u00d6zil delivered his 17th assist in the Premier League from a free kick for Danny Welbeck to head in the winner deep into stoppage time as Arsenal came from behind to beat league leaders Leicester City 2 -- 1 on 14 February . </P> <P> After a 2 -- 0 home defeat to Barcelona in the Champions League , \u00d6zil scored and assisted in a 3 -- 2 defeat at Old Trafford to Manchester United as the Gunners lost further ground in the title race . \u00d6zil started in the 2 -- 1 Watford in the FA Cup , where he set up Danny Welbeck for Arsenal 's consolation goal with a backheel assist , and three days later in a 3 -- 1 defeat to Barcelona in the Champions League as Arsenal crashed out in successive cup competitions in March . </P> <P> \u00d6zil assisted Olivier Giroud 's second goal in Arsenal 's last Premier League match of the season against Aston Villa in a 4 -- 0 home victory as the Gunners finished second ahead of fierce rivals , Tottenham Hotspur . That was \u00d6zil 's 19th assist of the season in the league , a record only beaten by Thierry Henry with 20 in 2002 -- 03 in Premier League history . \u00d6zil ended his third season at Arsenal with 8 goals and 20 assists in all club competitions , which won him the Arsenal Player of the Season award . </P> 2016 -- 17 season <P> \u00d6zil missed Arsenal 's opening day defeat to Liverpool , after his excursions at UEFA Euro 2016 meant he was not match - fit . However , he started his first game of the new season for his club in a 1 -- 3 away win at Watford , in which he scored his first goal of the campaign , heading in an Alexis S\u00e1nchez cross to score Arsenal 's third of the afternoon .

When asked about his country 's chances at Euro 2012 , \u00d6zil simply replied , `` We have the potential to beat anyone and we have what it takes to win the title .

Germany , however , emerged as the victorious side after winning the penalty shoot - out 6 -- 5 , despite \u00d6zil failing to convert his penalty kick after hitting the goal post . </P> <H2> Style of play </H2> \u00d6zil with Real Madrid in 2011 <P> A quick , creative and technical player , \u00d6zil excels in an advanced playmaking role , as a winger on either flank , or as an attacking midfielder through the centre of the pitch . During the 2010 FIFA World Cup , he was also deployed in a new role which was later described as a false - 10 or central winger , due to his tendency to drift from the centre into a wide position when in possession of the ball ; he has also been deployed in a more advanced role , where he usually functions as a second striker , as he often drops into deeper positions , from which he can link the midfield with the attack and initiate passing moves . An elegant left - footed player , his main attributes are his vision , his control , movement , passing range , and accurate crossing ability , as well as his delivery from set - pieces , which allow him to get into good attacking positions , create chances , and provide many assists for his teammates . </P> <P> Due to his creative ability and offensive prowess as a playmaker , \u00d6zil has been called `` assist - king '' in the media . As of January 2016 , \u00d6zil has the best ratio of assists per game in the history of the Premier League . Germany under - 21 manager Horst Hrubesch once said , `` We in Germany are prone to rave about foreign players . We praise Wayne Rooney to the heavens , likewise Ronaldo or Messi . But we have our own Messi . Our Messi is \u00d6zil . '' In the UEFA Euro 2012 qualifier against Belgium , he scored a goal which has been described as a `` work of art . '' Germany coach Joachim L\u00f6w hails \u00d6zil for his `` genius moments '' and his performance without the ball . </P> \u00d6zil on the ball in the 2014 World Cup Final <P> Former Real Madrid midfielder Xabi Alonso described \u00d6zil as `` the kind of player you do n't find these days , '' adding , `` He understands the game , sees things , combines and thrives between the lines , unlocking teams . '' Jos\u00e9 Mourinho , who coached \u00d6zil for a time at Real Madrid said , `` \u00d6zil is unique . There is no copy of him -- not even a bad copy . '' Assistant coach of the Germany national football team Hans - Dieter Flick said , `` We are proud to have him in our team . When he has the ball , you can feel the excitement and astonishment among the fans . '' Former Netherlands and Milan forward Ruud Gullit described \u00d6zil as a `` technically perfect '' player who has `` total control of the ball '' and a `` great imagination . '' Former Germany teammate Phillip Lahm said of \u00d6zil `` His vision is probably the best I have ever seen ... He is a dream for strikers . '' , while Mario G\u00f3mez called \u00d6zil `` probably the most brilliant footballer we have or ever had '' . Despite his reputation as an offensive playmaker , \u00d6zil has also drawn criticism at times for his lack of physicality and his low defensive work - rate off the ball . </P> <P> His nicknames have included `` der Rabe '' ( the Raven , or in Spanish , `` El Cuervo '' ) -- playing on his smart and opportunistic style of play , and at Werder Bremen `` der neue Diego '' ( the new Diego ) , in reference to Brazilian Diego , whose playmaker role he inherited , `` German Messi '' and `` German Zidane . '' At Real Madrid , he was supposedly called `` Nemo '' -- in reference to the clownfish Nemo from the Pixar movie Finding Nemo . </P> <H2> Outside football </H2> <H3> Personal life </H3> <P> \u00d6zil is a third - generation Turkish - German , who , in reference to his game , concludes , `` My technique and feeling for the ball is the Turkish side to my game . The discipline , attitude and always - give - your - all is the German part . '' Despite his Turkish descent , his entire life he has been committed to Germany . According to \u00d6zil 's own words and the majority of sources , his ancestors are ethnic Turks from Devrek , Zonguldak in northwestern Turkey . However , there are sources that claim \u00d6zil 's ancestors are ethnic Kurds . </P> <P> \u00d6zil is a practising Muslim . He recites from the Quran before his matches . Talking to the Berlin - based daily Der Tagesspiegel , \u00d6zil said , `` I always do that before I go out ( on the pitch ) . I pray and my teammates know that they can not talk to me during this brief period . '' He observes fasting during the Islamic month of Ramadan , but he has admitted that : `` Because of my job I can not follow Ramadan properly . I do it only the few days I can , only when I have a free day . But other than that it 's impossible , because you have to drink and eat a lot to stay at peak fitness . '' In May 2016 , he performed Umrah pilgrimage to Mecca . </P> <P> In 2010 , \u00d6zil received the Bambi award for being a prime example of successful integration within German society . </P> <P> \u00d6zil started dating singer Mandy Capristo in 2013 .

'' </P> <P> In May 2016 , international media covered \u00d6zil 's visit to the Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan , home to around 80,000 people displaced as a result of the Syrian civil war . \u00d6zil toured the camp as well as playing with children , signing autographs and handing out football shirts . </P> <P> In 2017 , he worked with the charity My Shining Star to make a child cancer patient 's dreams come true . He invited the child , Charlie , to be a guest at his private box and in the player 's lounge during a game with Sunderland at Emirates Stadium . </P> <H3> Media and sponsorships </H3> <P> In 2013 , \u00d6zil signed a sponsorship deal with German sportswear and equipment supplier Adidas . He has appeared in commercials for Adidas Predator boots with other star players such as Lionel Messi , Gareth Bale , Thomas M\u00fcller and James Rodriguez . One of those adverts , entitled `` Create Your Own Game '' , was released in August 2015 , in which \u00d6zil featured alongside those players . In 2013 , \u00d6zil launched his own logo . </P> <P> His autobiography , The Magic of the Game / Gunning for Greatness , was released in March 2017 . </P> <H2> Career Statistics </H2> <H3> Club </H3>
