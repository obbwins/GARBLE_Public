Alfred Prufrock '' , commonly known as `` Prufrock '' , is the first professionally published poem by American - born , British poet T.S. Eliot ( 1888 -- 1965 ) . Eliot began writing `` Prufrock '' in February 1910 , and it was first published in the June 1915 issue of Poetry : A Magazine of Verse at the instigation of Ezra Pound ( 1885 -- 1972 ) . It was later printed as part of a twelve - poem pamphlet ( or chapbook ) titled Prufrock and Other Observations in 1917 . At the time of its publication , Prufrock was considered outlandish , but is now seen as heralding a paradigmatic cultural shift from late 19th - century Romantic verse and Georgian lyrics to Modernism . </P> <P> The poem 's structure was heavily influenced by Eliot 's extensive reading of Dante Alighieri and makes several references to the Bible and other literary works -- including William Shakespeare 's plays Henry IV Part II , Twelfth Night , and Hamlet , the poetry of seventeenth - century metaphysical poet Andrew Marvell , and the nineteenth - century French Symbolists . Eliot narrates the experience of Prufrock using the stream of consciousness technique developed by his fellow Modernist writers . The poem , described as a `` drama of literary anguish '' , is a dramatic interior monologue of an urban man , stricken with feelings of isolation and an incapability for decisive action that is said `` to epitomize frustration and impotence of the modern individual '' and `` represent thwarted desires and modern disillusionment '' . </P> <P> Prufrock laments his physical and intellectual inertia , the lost opportunities in his life and lack of spiritual progress , and he is haunted by reminders of unattained carnal love . With visceral feelings of weariness , regret , embarrassment , longing , emasculation , sexual frustration , a sense of decay , and an awareness of mortality , `` Prufrock '' has become one of the most recognised voices in modern literature . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Composition and publication history <Ul> <Li> 1.1 Writing and first publication </Li> <Li> 1.2 Prufrock 's Pervigilium </Li> <Li> 1.3 Critical reception </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 Description <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Title </Li> <Li> 2.2 Epigraph </Li> <Li> 2.3 Themes and interpretation </Li> <Li> 2.4 Use of allusion </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Notes </Li> <Li> 4 Further reading </Li> <Li> 5 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Composition and publication History ( edit ) </H2> T.S. Eliot in 1923 , photographed by Lady Ottoline Morrell <H3> Writing and first publication ( edit ) </H3> <P> Eliot wrote `` The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock '' between February 1910 and July or August 1911 . Shortly after arriving in England to attend Merton College , Oxford , Eliot was introduced to American expatriate poet Ezra Pound , who instantly deemed Eliot `` worth watching '' and aided the start of Eliot 's career . Pound served as the overseas editor of Poetry : A Magazine of Verse and recommended to the magazine 's founder , Harriet Monroe , that Poetry publish `` The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock '' , extolling that Eliot and his work embodied a new and unique phenomenon among contemporary writers . Pound claimed that Eliot `` has actually trained himself AND modernized himself ON HIS OWN . The rest of the promising young have done one or the other , but never both . '' The poem was first published by the magazine in its June 1915 issue . </P> <P> In November 1915 `` The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock '' -- along with Eliot 's poems `` Portrait of a Lady , '' `` The Boston Evening Transcript , '' `` Hysteria , '' and `` Miss Helen Slingsby '' -- was included in Catholic Anthology 1914 -- 1915 edited by Ezra Pound and printed by Elkin Mathews in London . In June 1917 The Egoist , a small publishing firm run by Dora Marsden , published a pamphlet entitled Prufrock and Other Observations ( London ) , containing twelve poems by Eliot . `` The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock '' was the first in the volume . Also Eliot was appointed assistant editor of the Egoist in June 1917 . </P> <H3> Prufrock 's Pervigilium ( edit ) </H3> <P> According to Eliot biographer Lyndall Gordon , when Eliot was writing the first drafts of Prufrock in his notebook in 1910 -- 1911 , he intentionally kept four pages blank in the middle section of the poem . According to the notebooks , now in the collection of the New York Public Library , Eliot finished the poem that was originally published sometime in July and August 1911 -- when he was 22 years old . In 1912 , Eliot revised the poem and included a 38 - line section now called `` Prufrock 's Pervigilium '' which was inserted on those blank pages , and intended as a middle section for the poem . However , Eliot removed this section soon after seeking the advice of his fellow Harvard acquaintance and poet Conrad Aiken . This section would not be included in the original publication of Eliot 's poem but was included when published posthumously in the 1996 collection of Eliot 's early , unpublished drafts in Inventions of the March Hare : Poems 1909 -- 1917 . This Pervigilium section describes the `` vigil '' of Prufrock through an evening and night described by one reviewer as an `` erotic foray into the narrow streets of a social and emotional underworld '' that portray `` in clammy detail Prufrock 's tramping ' through certain half - deserted streets ' and the context of his ' muttering retreats / Of restless nights in one - night cheap hotels . ' '' </P> <H3> Critical reception ( edit ) </H3> <P> Its reception in London can be gauged from an unsigned review in The Times Literary Supplement on 21 June 1917 . `` The fact that these things occurred to the mind of Mr. Eliot is surely of the very smallest importance to anyone , even to himself . They certainly have no relation to poetry . '' </P> <P> The Harvard Vocarium at Harvard College recorded Eliot 's reading of Prufrock and other poems in 1947 , as part of their ongoing series of poetry readings by their authors . </P> <H2> Description ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Title ( edit ) </H3> <P> In his early drafts , Eliot gave the poem the subtitle `` Prufrock among the Women . '' This subtitle was apparently discarded before publication . Eliot called the poem a `` love song '' in reference to Rudyard Kipling 's poem `` The Love Song of Har Dyal , '' first published in Kipling 's collection Plain Tales from the Hills ( 1888 ) . In 1959 , Eliot addressed a meeting of the Kipling Society and discussed the influence of Kipling upon his own poetry : </P> <P> Traces of Kipling appear in my own mature verse where no diligent scholarly sleuth has yet observed them , but which I am myself prepared to disclose . I once wrote a poem called `` The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock '' : I am convinced that it would never have been called `` Love Song '' but for a title of Kipling 's that stuck obstinately in my head : `` The Love Song of Har Dyal '' . </P> <P> However , the origin of the name Prufrock is not certain , and Eliot never remarked on its origin other than to claim he was unsure of how he came upon the name . Many scholars and indeed Eliot himself have pointed towards the autobiographical elements in the character of Prufrock , and Eliot at the time of writing the poem was in the habit of rendering his name as `` T. Stearns Eliot , '' very similar in form to that of J. Alfred Prufrock . It is suggested that the name `` Prufrock '' came from Eliot 's youth in St. Louis , Missouri , where the Prufrock - Litton Company , a large furniture store , occupied one city block downtown at 420 -- 422 North Fourth Street . In a 1950 letter , Eliot said , `` I did not have , at the time of writing the poem , and have not yet recovered , any recollection of having acquired this name in any way , but I think that it must be assumed that I did , and that the memory has been obliterated . '' </P> <H3> Epigraph ( edit ) </H3> <P> The draft version of the poem 's epigraph comes from Dante 's Purgatorio ( XXVI , 147 -- 148 ) : </P> <Table> <Tr> <Td> <P> ' sovegna vos a temps de ma dolor ' . Poi s'ascose nel foco che gli affina . </P> </Td> <Td> <P> ' be mindful in due time of my pain ' . Then dived he back into that fire which refines them . </P> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> He finally decided not to use this , but eventually used the quotation in the closing lines of his 1922 poem The Waste Land . The quotation that Eliot did choose comes from Dante also . Inferno ( XXVII , 61 -- 66 ) reads : </P> <Table> <Tr> <Td> <P> S ` io credesse che mia risposta fosse A persona che mai tornasse al mondo , Questa fiamma staria senza piu scosse . Ma perciocch\u00e8 giammai di questo fondo Non torn\u00f2 vivo alcun , s'i'odo il vero , Senza tema d'infamia ti rispondo . </P> </Td> <Td> <P> If I but thought that my response were made to one perhaps returning to the world , this tongue of flame would cease to flicker . But since , up from these depths , no one has yet returned alive , if what I hear is true , I answer without fear of being shamed . </P> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> In context , the epigraph refers to a meeting between Dante and Guido da Montefeltro , who was condemned to the eighth circle of Hell for providing counsel to Pope Boniface VIII , who wished to use Guido 's advice for a nefarious undertaking . This encounter follows Dante 's meeting with Ulysses , who himself is also condemned to the circle of the Fraudulent . According to Ron Banerjee , the epigraph serves to cast ironic light on Prufrock 's intent . Like Guido , Prufrock had never intended his story to be told , and so by quoting Guido , Eliot reveals his view of Prufrock 's love song . </P> <P> Frederick Locke contends that Prufrock himself is suffering from multiple personalities of sorts , and that he embodies both Guido and Dante in the Inferno analogy . One is the storyteller ; the other the listener who later reveals the story to the world . He posits , alternatively , that the role of Guido in the analogy is indeed filled by Prufrock , but that the role of Dante is filled by you , the reader , as in `` Let us go then , you and I , '' ( 1 ) . In that , the reader is granted the power to do as he pleases with Prufrock 's love song . </P> <H3> Themes and interpretation ( edit ) </H3> <P> Because the poem is concerned primarily with the irregular musings of the narrator , it can be difficult to interpret . Laurence Perrine wrote , `` ( the poem ) presents the apparently random thoughts going through a person 's head within a certain time interval , in which the transitional links are psychological rather than logical '' . This stylistic choice makes it difficult to determine exactly what is literal and what is symbolic . On the surface , `` The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock '' relays the thoughts of a sexually frustrated middle - aged man who wants to say something but is afraid to do so , and ultimately does not . The dispute , however , lies in to whom Prufrock is speaking , whether he is actually going anywhere , what he wants to say , and to what the various images refer . </P> <P> The intended audience is not evident . Some believe that Prufrock is talking to another person or directly to the reader , while others believe Prufrock 's monologue is internal . Perrine writes `` The ' you and I ' of the first line are divided parts of Prufrock 's own nature '' , while Mutlu Konuk Blasing suggests that the `` you and I '' refers to the relationship between the dilemmas of the character and the author . Similarly , critics dispute whether Prufrock is going somewhere during the course of the poem . In the first half of the poem , Prufrock uses various outdoor images ( the sky , streets , cheap restaurants and hotels , fog ) , and talks about how there will be time for various things before `` the taking of a toast and tea '' , and `` time to turn back and descend the stair . '' This has led many to believe that Prufrock is on his way to an afternoon tea , where he is preparing to ask this `` overwhelming question '' . Others , however , believe that Prufrock is not physically going anywhere , but rather , is playing through it in his mind . </P> <P> Perhaps the most significant dispute lies over the `` overwhelming question '' that Prufrock is trying to ask . Many believe that Prufrock is trying to tell a woman of his romantic interest in her , pointing to the various images of women 's arms and clothing and the final few lines in which Prufrock laments that the mermaids will not sing to him . Others , however , believe that Prufrock is trying to express some deeper philosophical insight or disillusionment with society , but fears rejection , pointing to statements that express a disillusionment with society , such as `` I have measured out my life with coffee spoons '' ( line 51 ) . Many believe that the poem is a criticism of Edwardian society and Prufrock 's dilemma represents the inability to live a meaningful existence in the modern world . McCoy and Harlan wrote `` For many readers in the 1920s , Prufrock seemed to epitomize the frustration and impotence of the modern individual . He seemed to represent thwarted desires and modern disillusionment . '' </P> <P> In general , Eliot uses imagery which is indicative of Prufrock 's character , representing ageing and decay . For example , `` When the evening is spread out against the sky / Like a patient etherized upon a table '' ( lines 2 -- 3 ) , the `` sawdust restaurants '' and `` cheap hotels , '' the yellow fog , and the afternoon `` Asleep ... tired ... or it malingers '' ( line 77 ) , are reminiscent of languor and decay , while Prufrock 's various concerns about his hair and teeth , as well as the mermaids `` Combing the white hair of the waves blown back / When the wind blows the water white and black , '' show his concern over aging . </P> <H3> Use of allusion ( edit ) </H3> <P> Like many of Eliot 's poems , `` The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock '' makes numerous allusions to other works , which are often symbolic themselves . </P> <Ul> <Li> In `` Time for all the works and days of hands '' ( 29 ) the phrase ' works and days ' is the title of a long poem -- a description of agricultural life and a call to toil -- by the early Greek poet Hesiod . </Li> <Li> `` I know the voices dying with a dying fall '' ( 52 ) echoes Orsino 's first lines in Shakespeare 's Twelfth Night . </Li> <Li> The prophet of `` Though I have seen my head ( grown slightly bald ) brought in upon a platter / I am no prophet -- and here 's no great matter '' ( 81 -- 2 ) is John the Baptist , whose head was delivered to Salome by Herod as a reward for her dancing ( Matthew 14 : 1 -- 11 , and Oscar Wilde 's play Salome ) . </Li> <Li> `` To have squeezed the universe into a ball '' ( 92 ) and `` indeed there will be time '' ( 23 ) echo the closing lines of Marvell 's ' To His Coy Mistress ' . Other phrases such as , `` there will be time '' and `` there is time '' are reminiscent of the opening line of that poem : `` Had we but world enough and time '' . Marvell 's words in turn echo the General Prologue of Chaucer 's Canterbury Tales , `` whil I have tyme and space '' . </Li> <Li> `` ' I am Lazarus , come from the dead ' '' ( 94 ) may be either the beggar Lazarus ( of Luke 16 ) returning for the rich man who was not permitted to return from the dead to warn the brothers of a rich man about Hell , or the Lazarus ( of John 11 ) whom Christ raised from the dead , or both . </Li> <Li> `` Full of high sentence '' ( 117 ) echoes Chaucer 's description of the Clerk of Oxford in the General Prologue to The Canterbury Tales . </Li> <Li> `` There will be time to murder and create '' is a biblical allusion to Ecclesiastes 3 . </Li> <Li> In the final section of the poem , Prufrock rejects the idea that he is Prince Hamlet , suggesting that he is merely `` an attendant lord '' ( 112 ) whose purpose is to `` advise the prince '' ( 114 ) , a likely allusion to Polonius -- Polonius being also `` almost , at times , the Fool . '' </Li> <Li> `` Among some talk of you and me '' may be a reference to Quatrain 32 of Edward FitzGerald 's translation of the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam ( `` There was a Door to which I found no Key / There was a Veil past which I could not see / Some little Talk awhile of Me and Thee / There seemed -- and then no more of Thee and Me .
