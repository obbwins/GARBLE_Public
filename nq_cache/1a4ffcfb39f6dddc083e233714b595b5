She receives her first classroom assignment in Coal Valley , a small coal - mining town in Western Canada which is located just south of Robb , Alberta . There , life is simple -- but often fraught with challenges . Elizabeth charms most everyone in Coal Valley , except Royal North West Mounted Police Constable Jack Thornton ( Daniel Lissing ) . He believes Thatcher 's wealthy father has doomed the lawman 's career by insisting he be assigned in town to protect the shipping magnate 's daughter . The town of Coal Valley was renamed Hope Valley in Episode 1 , Season 2 after the coal mine was closed . </P> <P> Living in this 1910 coal town , Elizabeth must learn the ways of the Canadian frontier movement if she wishes to thrive in the rural west on her own . Lori Loughlin portrays Abigail Stanton , whose husband , the foreman of the mine , and her only son -- along with 45 other miners -- have recently been killed in an explosion , which turns out to have been a tragic accident waiting to happen -- a result of the mining - company site manager 's irresponsible management and lack of due care in his management of the mine . The newly widowed women find their faith tested when they must go to work in the mine to keep a roof over their heads , food on the table , and compile a wage for the town 's teacher . </P> <H2> Episodes ( edit ) </H2> Main article : List of When Calls the Heart episodes <Table> <Tr> <Th_colspan=\"2\"> Season </Th> <Th_colspan=\"2\"> Episodes </Th> <Th_colspan=\"2\"> Originally aired </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> First aired </Th> <Th> Last aired </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td_colspan=\"1\"> </Td> <Td_colspan=\"2\"> 12 </Td> <Td_colspan=\"1\"> January 11 , 2014 ( 2014 - 01 - 11 ) </Td> <Td> March 29 , 2014 ( 2014 - 03 - 29 ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td_colspan=\"1\"> </Td> <Td_colspan=\"2\"> 7 </Td> <Td_colspan=\"1\"> April 25 , 2015 ( 2015 - 04 - 25 ) </Td> <Td> June 13 , 2015 ( 2015 - 06 - 13 ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td_colspan=\"3\"> New Year 's Wish </Td> <Td_colspan=\"2\"> December 26 , 2015 ( 2015 - 12 - 26 ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td_colspan=\"1\"> </Td> <Td_colspan=\"2\"> 8 </Td> <Td_colspan=\"1\"> February 21 , 2016 ( 2016 - 02 - 21 ) </Td> <Td> April 10 , 2016 ( 2016 - 04 - 10 ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td_colspan=\"3\"> Christmas </Td> <Td_colspan=\"2\"> December 25 , 2016 ( 2016 - 12 - 25 ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td_colspan=\"1\"> </Td> <Td_colspan=\"2\"> 10 </Td> <Td_colspan=\"1\"> February 19 , 2017 ( 2017 - 02 - 19 ) </Td> <Td> April 23 , 2017 ( 2017 - 04 - 23 ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td_colspan=\"3\"> The Christmas Wishing Tree </Td> <Td_colspan=\"2\"> December 25 , 2017 ( 2017 - 12 - 25 ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td_colspan=\"1\"> 5 </Td> <Td_colspan=\"2\"> 10 </Td> <Td_colspan=\"1\"> February 18 , 2018 ( 2018 - 02 - 18 ) </Td> <Td> April 22 , 2018 ( 2018 - 04 - 22 ) </Td> </Tr> </Table> <H2> Cast ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Main ( edit ) </H3> <Ul> <Li> Erin Krakow as Elizabeth Thatcher Thornton </Li> <Li> Daniel Lissing as Jack Thornton ( Seasons 1 - 5 ) </Li> <Li> Lori Loughlin as Abigail Stanton </Li> <Li> Jack Wagner as Bill Avery </Li> <Li> Martin Cummins as Henry Gowen </Li> <Li> Pascale Hutton as Rosemary LeVeaux Coulter </Li> <Li> Kavan Smith as Leland Coulter </Li> </Ul> <H3> Recurring ( edit ) </H3> <Ul> <Li> Paul Greene as Carson Shepherd </Li> <Li> Andrea Brooks as Faith Carter </Li> <Li> Eva Bourne as Clara Weller Stanton </Li> <Li> Aren Buchholz as Jesse Flynn </Li> <Li> Carter Ryan Evancic as Cody Hastings </Li> <Li> Loretta Walsh as Florence Blakeley </Li> <Li> Erica Carroll as Dottie Ramsey </Li> <Li> Johannah Newmarch as Molly Sullivan </Li> <Li> Mark Humphrey as Frank Hogan </Li> <Li> Chelah Horsdal as Cat Montgomery </Li> <Li> Mitchell Kummen as Gabe Montgomery </Li> <Li> Gracyn Shinyei as Emily Montgomery </Li> <Li> Logan Williams as Miles Montgomery </Li> <Li> Ben Rosenbaum as Mike Hickam </Li> <Li> Ava Grace Cooper as Opal </Li> <Li> Charlotte Hegele as Julie Thatcher </Li> <Li> Max Lloyd - Jones as Tom Thornton </Li> <Li> Brooke Shields as Charlotte Thornton </Li> <Li> Ali Skovbye as Becky Hastings </Li> <Li> Garwin Sanford as William Thatcher </Li> <Li> Lynda Boyd as Grace Thatcher </Li> <Li> Devon Weigel as Viola Thatcher </Li> <Li> Marcus Rosner as Charles Kensington </Li> <Li> Josie Bissett as AJ Foster </Li> <Li> Steve Bacic as Charles Spurlock </Li> <Li> Kristina Wagner as Nora Avery </Li> <Li> Mamie Laverock as Rosaleen Sullivan </Li> <Li> Adrian Hough as Reverend Anderson </Li> <Li> Will Verchere - Gopaulsingh as Caleb Dunbar </Li> <Li> Laura Bertram as Mary Dunbar </Li> <Li> Derek Hamilton as Dewitt Graves </Li> <Li> Niall Matter as Shane Cantrell ( season 4 ) </Li> <Li> Spencer Drever as Cyrus Rivera ( season 4 ) </Li> </Ul> <H2> Characters ( edit ) </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> This section may contain an excessive amount of intricate detail that may interest only a particular audience .

The middle daughter of William and Grace Thatcher , Elizabeth has two sisters , older sister Viola and younger sister Julie . Elizabeth finds herself in Coal Valley , a small community on the Canadian frontier in need of a teacher , and quickly discovers it is not an easy place to live , lacking the creature comforts and luxuries of her privileged life with her family . She soon meets the newly appointed and charismatic Mountie Jack Thornton and develops an immediate dislike for him . However , over time they become good friends , and develop an obvious attraction to one another . In the final episode of season 1 , `` Prelude to a Kiss '' ( also titled as `` Final Adieu '' ) , after overcoming many obstacles throughout the season , Jack tells Elizabeth `` You 're the one , you 're the only one '' and they share a kiss . Throughout season 2 , Elizabeth 's feelings for Jack are high at times as well as low . Finally , in the season 2 finale , she admits that his job as a Mountie scares her . After being comforted both admitting that they love each other , Jack and Elizabeth kiss . </Li> <Li> Jack Thornton is a laid back country boy . Jack is the son of Mountie Thomas Thornton and his wife Charlotte Thornton . Jack has a younger brother , Tom ( named after his father ) . As a Mountie and a man of stout character and integrity , he often finds himself protecting and saving people . In season 1 's `` A Telling Silence , '' Jack finds a basset hound whom he names Rip ( after Rip Van Winkle ) and takes home with him . A source of comfort and companion in the small town , Jack often goes to Rip when times in his life are difficult . In season 2 's `` With All My Heart , '' Rip , who 's afraid of thunder , hides in the mine shafts during a storm . Jack and Elizabeth search for him ; in their search , their relationship grows stronger . Upon his first meeting of Elizabeth , Jack developed an instant dislike and it appeared she irritated him . However , he grew to like and then fall madly and completely in love with her over time . In `` Rules of Engagement '' ( S. 1 ) , it is revealed that Jack was briefly engaged to Rosemary LeVeaux when she comes looking for him . However , they have both changed and realize that they can not have a relationship as they once did ever again . In `` Prelude to a Kiss '' ( S. 1 ) , Jack found out that Elizabeth may be leaving Coal Valley . Taking her on a walk and giving her a framed picture of them that he had sketched , he asks her not to leave Coal Valley and tells her , `` You 're the one , you 're the only one . '' She replied that she was `` not going anywhere '' , Coal Valley was where she belonged before they share a kiss . In season 2 , Elizabeth and Jack share a hot - and - cold relationship until the finale , `` With All My Heart . '' They both admit that they love each other and share another kiss . Jack 's brother , Tom , is introduced season 2 's `` Trials of the Heart , '' and their rocky relationship continues until `` Coming Together , Coming Apart . '' Jack gently reminds his younger brother how their father was so proud of him , but he would n't be proud of the way he was currently living . Both in tears , Jack tells his younger brother that he believes in him and that he can turn his life around . More recently , Jack has become good friends with the sawmill operator , Lee Coulter . In season 3 , Jack begins the new year knowing that Elizabeth only has eyes for him and that her relationship with Charles is over for good . In `` Hearts In Question , '' Jack 's mother Charlotte shows up unexpectedly . She meets Elizabeth and is suspicious of her , but through staying her sees Elizabeth for who she really is : a trustworthy , dedicated teacher . In the season finale , `` Prayers From The Heart , '' Jack is injured in a flood . But he miraculously recovers in time to serve as Lee 's best man at his wedding . </Li> <Li> Abigail Stanton is a Coal Valley woman who tragically lost her husband and son in the mining accident . Abigail is a very kind woman , and she stands strongly for the things she believes in . She is one of the first women to welcome Elizabeth and the two women quickly become friends . When Elizabeth accidentally burns down the little teacherage , Abigail gladly welcomes her into her home to live . After being complimented on her cooking , Abigail decides to open a cafe in Coal Valley . Together , Abigail and Elizabeth move into the rooms above the cafe . At the end of season 1 , Abigail enjoys the company of Bill Avery , a Mountie , serving as a Forensic Investigator and friend of Jack Thornton 's . In season 2 , Abigail takes in her daughter - in - law , Clara , the wife of her late son Peter whom Abigail sees as the daughter she never had . With Bill 's past being revealed , Abigail ends their friendship and spends more time with the new pastor , Frank Hogan . Also , she is a strong independent woman that is set on doing the things that are right and tries to help Elizabeth . </Li> <Li> Bill Avery is a mysterious , quiet man . He first appears in season 1 's `` Rules of Engagement , '' in order to help Jack expose Mr. Gowen 's wrongdoings . Bill is immediately attracted to widow Abigail Stanton . Things are going well until Abigail discovers a picture of Bill 's family and his wedding ring . He later tells her that his son died , as well as his wife . However , his wife , Nora , comes to confront him in season 2 's `` Heart 's Desire . '' </Li> <Li> Henry Gowen is a cold , cynical man who formerly owned the coal mine . After the mine was shut down , Henry became the mayor of Hope Valley and still creates a cold , cynical presence whenever people are around him . Henry is highly disliked and feared in the town . He frequently uses bribery to get what he wants , which is never for the good of the town . </Li> <Li> Rosemary `` Rosie '' LeVeaux Coulter is a flamboyant , enthusiastic actress from New York . She was briefly engaged to Jack Thornton , but they both realized that it would n't work out . Rosie immediately disliked Elizabeth and viewed her as `` the competition , '' but eventually came to really care about Elizabeth , even if she has a hard time showing it . At the beginning of season 2 , Rosemary began working at the cafe with Abigail and the two quickly became friends . Spending time with Abigail helped tone down some of Rosemary 's enthusiasm and made her a more likable person . Rosemary even came to like Elizabeth , even if only on an acquaintance level . Truthfully , she cares about everyone in Hope Valley , especially Lee , with whom she shares an mutual attraction . When Rosie is not spending time with Lee , talking to Abigail , or dreaming about the glamorous life of an actress , she can often be found somewhere writing her weekly advice column for Hope Valley 's newspaper ! In season 3 , Rosemary 's friendship with Elizabeth deepened . Instead of viewing her as an adversary , she finds a friend in Elizabeth . Throughout season 3 , Rosemary 's relationship with Lee becomes more romantic . In `` Heart Of A Hero , '' seeing that Lee needs to spend more time at the sawmill to help the new settlers find jobs , Rosemary tells Lee that the theatre does n't have to be built . He insists , but she says how important his job is . He smiles and tells her he will one day build her theatre , telling her that she is `` the best part of his life . '' The couple shares in their first kiss . In `` A Gentle Heart , '' Lee is injured . Thinking he is asleep , Rosemary pours out her heart to him , telling how much she loves him . In `` Heartbreak , '' Rosemary is offered a job in Hollywood filming . This has always been Rosemary 's dream , to be an actress . Lee unselfishly tells her to do whatever she feels best , but it is obvious that the thought of her leaving Hope Valley hurts him . Rosemary considers her options and realizes that her place is in Hope Valley , with Lee . Lee then tells her that he has another `` role '' that he thinks would be perfect for her and proposes marriage . She happily accepts . In `` Hearts In Question , '' Rosemary enthusiastically plans for their wedding . The couple weds in the season 3 finale `` Prayers From The Heart , '' with Elizabeth and Abigail as her maids of honor . </Li> <Li> Leland `` Lee '' Coulter is a kind , laidback , patient man who opens a sawmill in Hope Valley . When timber becomes Coal Valley 's major source of natural resources , the town is renamed Hope Valley . He shares a mutual attraction to Rosemary and proves to be one of the few people who can outwit her . When she declines his romantic intentions , Lee recruits his friend , Molly Sullivan , to make Rosemary jealous ; the ploy succeeds and Rosemary accepts his suit , appreciating Lee 's good qualities . Despite her dramatic and occasionally prickly personality , Lee 's compassion and patience never fails with her . With Rosemary 's help , Lee beat Mr. Gowen at his own game in `` Heart and Home . '' When not at work , Lee enjoys being with friends , including Jack Thornton , who shares Lee 's simple and laidback outlook , allowing the men to discuss their lives and exchange romantic advice . In season 3 , Lee 's mill is unfortunately sabotaged by a man inside . Through Bill and Jack 's investigation , they find the culprit . In season 3 's `` Heart Of A Hero , '' Rosemary unselfishly gives up the theatre that Lee promised to build her . Lee promises that one day , he will build her the theatre at a time when he is n't so involved with the sawmill and finding people jobs . In `` A Gentle Heart , '' Lee is injured . Thinking Lee is asleep , Rosemary pours out her heart to Lee , telling him how afraid she was when she heard he had been injured . He however hears each and every word . She told him how much she loves him and to never leave her . In the episode `` Heartbreak , '' Lee thinks Rosemary may leave Hope Valley when she is offered a movie job in Hollywood . When she gives up the movie , seeing her future in Hope Valley with him , he asks her to marry him . The couple weds in the season 3 finale , `` Prayers From The Heart . '' Jack serves the role of Lee 's best man . </Li> <Li> Julie Thatcher is Elizabeth 's hopeless romantic younger sister . She often gets herself into sticky situations by falling head over heels for men who are n't quite what they seem . In season 2 she gets involved with Jack 's brother Tom , which causes trouble with her family and for Jack and Elizabeth 's relationship . </Li> <Li> Cat Montgomery is a kind , encouraging woman in Coal Valley . She is a widow and mother of three : Gabe , Miles , and Emily . Cat was one of the first mothers to show kindness to Elizabeth when she first came . She desperately wants her children to remember the good memories of their father as seen by her self - sacrificing acts in `` Secrets and Lies . '' Possessing a great sense of teamwork and encouragement , Cat supports the women of Coal Valley while working in the mines in `` Cease and Desist . '' She is good friends with Elizabeth and Abigail . In `` These Games , '' she also helps Jack catch a thief . </Li> <Li> Florence Blakeley is a feisty gossip in Hope Valley . She often has a pessimistic perspective and always seems to find the negative , even in a very positive situation . In `` Heart and Home , '' Abigail told Florence what she really thought about her , which causes Florence to rein in her negativity somewhat , though she remains fairly outspoken . While not always likable , Florence adds spice to life in Hope Valley . </Li> <Li> Molly Sullivan is a friend of Lee Coulter and Elizabeth Thatcher . Molly 's husband was killed in the mine disaster . She has a daughter Rosaleen . In season 1 's `` A Telling Silence , '' Rosaleen has trouble in school because she misses her father so much . When she runs away , Elizabeth finds her in the mine , feeling guilty that she did n't bring her father his lunch the day of the disaster because she wanted to play with a friend instead . She fears her mother will blame her , but Elizabeth convinces her that Molly will `` say that she loves her more than life itself . '' Molly is reunited with her daughter , to the joy of the town 's people . In season 2 's `` With All My Heart , '' Lee feels it 's time to `` play hard to get '' with Rosemary , so he enlists help from Molly . She pretends to be interested in him romantically . This ploy works and Rosemary admits that she does in fact like him . Molly is a kind woman and was among the first to welcome Elizabeth to town . </Li> <Li> Clara Stanton is the wife of Abigail 's late son Peter , and is a sweet , quiet , and sensitive young woman . Abigail never knew she had a daughter - in - law until season 2 's `` Trials of the Heart ; '' with Peter having married Clara only three days before he was killed . In `` Heart 's Desire , '' Abigail invites Clara to come live with her in Hope Valley , an offer that Clara accepts . </Li> <Li> Charles Kensington III is an old friend of Elizabeth with whom she reconnects while in Hamilton .
