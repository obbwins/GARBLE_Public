He was motivated by a tramp in 2002 surfing trip to Australia in which he was hoping to capture quality action photos , but could not because amateur photographers could not get close enough or buy quality equipment at reasonable prices . His desire for a camera system that could capture the professional angles inspired the ' GoPro ' name . </P> <P> Woodman raised a portion of his initial capital by selling bead and shell belts for under US $20 from his VW van and , later , fashionable camera straps . He also received over $230,000 from his parents to invest in the business . </P> <P> In 2004 , the company sold its first camera system , which used 35 mm film . Digital still and video cameras were later introduced . As of 2014 , a fixed - lens HD video camera with a wide 170 - degree lens was available ; two or more can be paired to create 360 video . </P> <P> On June 4 , 2014 , the company announced the appointment of former Microsoft executive Tony Bates as President reporting directly to Woodman . </P> <P> In January 2016 , GoPro partnered with Periscope for live streaming . </P> <P> After growing the number of employees by more than 500 in 2015 , the company responded to weak sales in the fourth quarter by cutting about 7 % of its workforce ( 100 workers ) in January 2016 . </P> <P> At its peak , a share of GoPro was valued at $86 , but on September 27 , 2016 , only $16.79 . </P> <P> In November 2016 , the company announced it was laying off an additional 200 employees in an effort to reduce costs . The company also announced that President Tony Bates would be stepping down at the end of 2016 . 270 more employees were laid off in March 2017 . </P> <H3> Corporate actions ( edit ) </H3> <P> On March 30 , 2011 , GoPro acquired CineForm . The acquisition included the CineForm 444 video codec used in the film Slumdog Millionaire . The company claimed that the codec `` makes HD and 3D editing faster and more convenient without sacrificing image quality '' . It was incorporated in the company 's 3D Hero System shortly after the acquisition . </P> <P> In March 2013 , GoPro issued a DMCA takedown notice to website DigitalRev.com , which had posted a review of its product , citing trademark use as a breach of copyright . This notice was retracted 10 days later , citing `` erroneous enforcement '' . </P> <P> On February 29 , 2016 , GoPro spent $105 million and acquired two start - ups , namely , Stupeflix and Vemory , for their video editing tools Replay and Splice . </P> <H3> IPO ( edit ) </H3> <P> On February 7 , 2014 , GoPro submitted a confidential filing for an initial public offering ( IPO ) with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) . </P> <P> On May 19 , 2014 , GoPro filed its S - 1 with the SEC without specifying the number of shares or their price . The company stated that they hoped to raise at least $100 million through the sale of shares , using the money to pay off debt in full ( $111 million as of March 31 , 2014 ) and `` to acquire or invest in complementary businesses , technologies or assets '' . They said that they planned to list on the NASDAQ stock exchange using the symbol ' GPRO . ' </P> <P> The expected price range was $21 to $24 a share ; on June 25 , 2014 , GoPro sold 17.8 million shares to initial investors at $24 per share ( totaling $427.2 M ) . At the IPO price the company was valued at $2.95 billion . 1.5 percent of those shares were allotted to LOYAL3 , a technology platform that allows small investors to participate . </P> <P> One reason for GoPro 's decision to go public was the potential to become a media company to generate additional revenue from the content its cameras create . </P> <H2> Product lines ( edit ) </H2> <H3> HERO cameras ( edit ) </H3> <P> Woodman worked on his first camera for two years after founding the company , eventually introducing the GoPro 35mm HERO in September 2004 at San Diego 's Action Sports Retailer trade show . In its first year GoPro sold $150,000 worth of products . In 2006 the company introduced its first Digital HERO , with 10 second video capability , and generated $800,000 in revenue . The following year GoPro sales quadrupled to $3.4 million . </P> <P> In 2014 , the company was selling the HERO3+ in editions of different colors . It was capable of filming in 16 : 9 aspect ratio , supporting 4K UHD video and 12 MP still photographs . The HERO4 was introduced on 24 September 2014 . </P> <P> At 28 September Gopro released new Hero 6 . It has new , better stabilisation , than Hero 5 and it can capture 4K in 60 FPS . Hero 6 Black costs about $500 . </P> <H3> GoPro Karma & GoPro Karma grip ( edit ) </H3> GoPro drone Karma <P> The GoPro Karma is GoPro 's consumer drone . </P> <P> In 2014 , GoPro entered into discussions with DJI for a private label model built with the GoPro branding . After the failure of these negotiations , GoPro entered into an agreement with 3D Robotics ( 3DR ) for a similar partnership based on 3DR 's flight controllers . 3DR failed to meet their agreed upon timelines . As a result , GoPro took full control of the development process in mid-2015 . </P> <P> Scheduled to be released early 2016 , the GoPro Karma project was delayed several times before the GoPro Karma was announced with an introduction date of October 23 , 2016 . The Karma was released along with newer models of the HERO5 and Session cameras and features a removable handheld stabilizer ( gimbal ) integrated into the design . After a few customers complained about power failure during operation , GoPro recalled Karma drones and gave customers full refunds . </P> <P> In February 2017 , GoPro re-launched the Karma Drone . </P> <H3> Accessories ( edit ) </H3> <P> GoPro produces various mounting accessories for its cameras including a 3 - way mount , suction cup , chest harness , jaws - type flexible clamp , dog harness , surfing mount , etc . </P> <H3> Video editing ( edit ) </H3> <P> The company developed GoPro Studio , simple video editing software to edit camera footage . It was reported that GoPro intended to also become a content provider , also with a new app for the HERO5 called GoPro Quik to share , and edit videos easier . </P> <H2> Content company ( edit ) </H2> <P> In April 2014 , GoPro was listed by Adweek as one of the `` Top 10 Best Brand Channels on YouTube '' based on a combination of views , shares , comments and overall engagement . Content is uploaded daily , an additional source of revenue for the company . </P> <P> As part of its transformation to a media company in 2014 , GoPro created additional channels with GoPro content on YouTube , Virgin America , and Xbox Live . This was extended to the PlayStation Network in 2015 . </P> <H2> HD HERO cameras ( edit ) </H2> <P> As of October 2014 , GoPro sells three fixed - lens cameras , two without viewfinders and one including a touchscreen viewfinder . A 2 - bit LCD on the front of the camera allows access to its menu system , which is controlled by the front and top shutter buttons . The HERO4 Black have dimensions of 41 mm \u00d7 59 mm \u00d7 30 mm and weighs 88 grams ( 152 grams with housing ) . Still images from 6 to 12 megapixels can be captured . The cameras are sold with a clear polycarbonate HD Housing with a glass lens that is rated shockproof and waterproof to 131 feet ( 40 m ) , with a quick - release buckle on the top and threads at the bottom to attach to all of the GoPro mounts . The housing has metal buttons that connect to the camera 's controls and has a `` skeleton '' backdoor option to allow audio recording when the camera is used with a mount but without the need to be watertight or shockproof . </P> <H2> Products ( edit ) </H2> <H3> HERO cameras ( edit ) </H3> 35mm ( edit ) <P> The 35mm camera ( model # 001 ) became available on April 13 , 2005 . It had dimensions of 2.5 by 3 inches ( 64 by 76 mm ) and weighed 0.45 pounds ( 200 g ) . It included the camera , a clear case with quick release , a camera strap and ski glove adapter lash . It could pivot `` on the fly '' and be functional to a depth in water of about 15 feet ( 5 m ) . It was described as a `` reusable wrist camera '' and included a roll of 24 exposure Kodak 400 film . </P> Digital ( edit ) <P> The Digital HERO released in 2006 ( Model : SQ907 mini-cam ) had a 640 \u00d7 460 camera and shot VGA definition 320X240 ( 10 fps ) video for a maximum of 10 seconds . The Digital HERO1 had 32 MB internal memory without SD slot . </P> Digital 3 ( edit ) <P> The Digital HERO3 released in 2007 had a 3 - megapixel camera and shot standard definition 512 \u00d7 384 video . It was rated up to 30 m ( 98.4 feet ) in depth . </P> Digital 5 ( edit ) <P> The Digital HERO5 was first introduced on December 5 , 2006 . It had a 5 megapixel still photo sensor and supported standard definition ( 512 \u00d7 384 ) video capture . It ran on two AAA batteries , had 16 MB of internal memory and could function with a 2 GB SD card . Its housing was rated to 100 ft / 30 meters depth . Its dimensions were 2.6 \u00d7 1.75 \u00d7 1.25 inches ( 66 \u00d7 44 \u00d7 32 mm ) . The camera is not designed to work with the newer HD HERO line of housings , although the standard screw mounts are indeed compatible . </P> Digital Wide ( edit ) <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> This section is empty .

It has an 11 MP image sensor , improved low - light capability and records at up to 120 fps . It was sold with three different accessory packages as the Outdoor , Motorsports , and Surf Editions . </P> HERO3 ( edit ) <P> In late 2012 , GoPro announced the HERO3 line of cameras . These cameras came in three editions : black , silver and white . </P> <P> All three versions of the HERO3 come in a 30 % smaller and 25 % lighter package , with WiFi built in . The change of the physical dimensions of the cameras compared to the previous generations ( HERO1 and HERO2 were physically identical ) means that some accessories for HD HERO Original and HERO2 are not compatible with HERO3 , so GoPro made new versions of those accessories specifically for HERO3 ( and mostly for HERO3+ , see below ) . Those new versions of accessories are usually not compatible with older Hero camera generations . However , a lot of other accessories are compatible with all HD Hero camera generations . </P> <P> The HERO3 Silver and Black cameras have significantly less battery endurance than the HD HERO Original and HERO2 . For example , in 720p resolution with 25 / 30 fps , while HD HERO Original and HERO2 have a stated battery runtime of 3 hours , HERO3 Silver Edition has a stated battery runtime of 2 hours , and HERO3 Black Edition has a stated battery runtime of 1.5 hours ( the Black Edition 's `` most economical '' setting is 1080p / 30 fps , so this also partially contributes to its poor battery runtime ) . </P> <P> The Black Edition has a new 12 MP sensor that can capture 4K UHD digital video at 15 fps , 2.7 K video at 30 fps , 1440p at 48 fps , 1080p at 60 fps , 960p at 100 fps , 720p at 120 fps and WVGA at 240 fps . The Black edition also includes the WiFi Remote . The Black Edition can not record at 25 / 30 fps in 720p and WVGA resolutions ; it can only record at very fast frame rates in those resolutions . This is a deliberate firmware limitation , as the manufacturer does not expect that this high - end camera model will be used at these lower resolutions and frame rates . </P> <P> The Silver Edition uses the same 11 MP sensor as the HERO2 , and the White edition uses the same 5 MP sensor as the HD HERO Original . </P> HERO3+ ( edit ) Play media A timelapse recording one frame every 10 seconds with a GoPro HERO3 camera mounted on a bicycle helmet during a bike ride in Chicago . Note how the wide angle lens allows for the rider to capture wide images . <P> In October 2013 , GoPro released the HERO3+ , available in Black and Silver Editions , replacing the HERO3 generation . The HERO3 White Edition remains as GoPro 's low - end device . </P> <P> The HERO3+ camera models claim dramatically improved low light performance and have a waterproof enclosure which is 20 % lighter and 15 % smaller than the HERO3 's , according to the GoPro website . The HERO3+ camera housing is 20 % smaller than the HERO3 . The cameras are claimed to have improved image sharpness ( close focus down to 7 '' vs about 3 ft on the HERO3 , at the expense of distant focus which is slightly less sharp with HERO3+ ) , and better audio functionality with wind noise reduction . Battery life is claimed to be 30 % longer than for the HERO3 model ( both through better efficiency and a higher - capacity battery of the same dimensions ) . </P> <P> The Black Edition has video modes of 1440p48 , 1080p60 , 960p100 and 720p120 as well as 4K15 and 2.7 K30 and can shoot 12 MP stills at up to 30 fps . The HERO3+ Black Edition also offers an optional function in firmware ( called `` SuperView '' ) which increases the field of view . It has additional functions , including dynamic low light situation adjustment , higher - quality recording modes ( higher bitrates , no white balance applied , etc . ) etc . The Black Edition continues to include a Wifi Remote . It does not have the ability to record 25 / 30 fps in 720p and WVGA modes ( it can only record at very fast frame rates in those lower resolutions ) . This is an intentional firmware limitation . The battery runtime of HERO3+ Black Edition is significantly longer than HERO3 Black Edition but 30 -- 50 % lower than the battery runtime of the older HERO2 and HERO1 . </P> <P> The Silver Edition has video modes of 1080p60 and 720p120 and can shoot 10 MP stills at up to 10 fps . In contrast to the Black Edition , the Silver Edition can record at 25 / 30 fps ( or higher ) in all supported resolutions . HERO3+ Silver Edition also has about 25 % - 50 % longer battery runtime during recording than HERO3+ Black Edition ( they both use the same batteries ) . The difference in runtime depends on the resolution / fps combination , and whether WiFi and GoPro mobile application are used during recording . The difference in runtime increases as the fps is lowered and the additional functions are deactivated on both cameras . The battery runtime of HERO3+ Silver Edition is similar to the battery runtime of HERO2 and HERO1 . </P> <P> The HERO3 HD camera was awarded the 2013 Technology & Engineering Emmy Award for its contribution to television . </P> HERO4 ( edit ) GoPro Hero 4 Silver Edition <P> In September 2014 , GoPro announced the HERO4 , available in Black Edition and Silver Edition , which replace their respective HERO3+ generation predecessors . The HERO Session , a budget camera , was also announced . </P> <P> The HERO4 Black Edition still has a 12 megapixel ( MP ) CMOS and a f / 2.8 fixed maximum aperture and focus free . It adds Bluetooth connectivity , Highlight tag , Protune Available for photo and a new processor claimed by GoPro to be twice as fast as that of the HERO3+ Black Edition , doubling the frame rates in most resolutions . The HERO4 Black Edition can record 4K UHD video ( 3840 \u00d7 2160 ) at a frame rate of 24 , 25 and 30 fps . In Superview mode , 4k is only possible at 25 fps . Many other rates and resolutions are available . The HERO4 Black Edition still shoots stills at a maximum of 12 MP with a maximum burst rate of 30 fps . With Wi - Fi disabled at 4k / 30 , GoPro claims the HERO4 Black Edition battery life to be 65 minutes , increasing to a maximum of 1h 50 ' at 720p / 240 . The HERO4 Black battery is in a different form factor than its predecessors . Initial side - by - side comparisons of HERO3+ and HERO4 Black edition video results suggest that the newer model has more detail at long range and similar performance at close range . </P> <P> The HERO4 Silver Edition is basically a HERO3 Black Edition with the addition of a micro speaker , built - in touchscreen display , Protune for photo and highlight tag ( the first GoPro with this ) , a lower clocked Cortex - A9 and missing the Black Edition 's integrated analog - to - digital converter which supports a wider variety of professional low - sensitivity external microphones . The video modes supported by the HERO4 Silver Edition are similar to those of the HERO3+ Black , due to the higher processing speed and thermal requirements of encoding 4K video ( 3840 \u00d7 2160 ) , but it supports Wi - Fi , Bluetooth and contains the same Ambarella Inc . A9 system on a chip ( SoC ) as in the HERO4 Black . </P> <P> The HERO Session , released July 6 , 2015 , is 50 % smaller and 40 % lighter compared to other versions of the GoPro HERO4 camera . </P> <P> The HERO4 models maintain the H. 264 video codec of previous versions and MP4 file formats . GoPro claims the mono microphone in both the Black and Silver Editions has twice the dynamic range of that in the HERO3+ , and that the HERO4 Black and Silver Editions have improved low - light performance . </P> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Model </Th> <Th> HERO Session </Th> <Th> Hero4 Silver </Th> <Th> Hero4 Black </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Sensor Size </Th> <Td> 1 / 3.2 '' </Td> <Td> 1 / 2.3 '' </Td> <Td> 1 / 2.3 '' </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Aperture </Th> <Td> f / 2.8 </Td> <Td> f / 2.8 </Td> <Td> f / 2.8 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> </Th> <Td> 38 x 38 x 38 mm </Td> <Td> 41 x 59 x 30 mm </Td> <Td> 41 x 59 x 30 mm </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Weight </Th> <Td> 74 g </Td> <Td> 83 g ( 147 g with case ) </Td> <Td> 88 g ( 152 g with case ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Still Image Resolution </Th> <Td> 8 MP </Td> <Td> 12 MP </Td> <Td> 12 MP </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Video Modes </Th> <Td> 1440p30 1080p60 720p100 480p120 </Td> <Td> 4k15 2.7 k30 1080p60 720p120 480p240 </Td> <Td> 4k30 2.7 k60 1440p80 1080p120 720p240 480p240 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Photo burst </Th> <Td> 10 fps </Td> <Td> 10 fps </Td> <Td> 30 fps </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Connectivity </Th> <Td> WiFi , Bluetooth </Td> <Td> WiFi , Bluetooth </Td> <Td> WiFi , Bluetooth </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Water Resistance </Th> <Td> 10 m </Td> <Td> 40 m ( with case ) </Td> <Td> 40 m ( with case ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Touchscreen </Th> <Td> no </Td> <Td> 1.5 inches ( 38 mm ) 320x240 </Td> <Td> optional extra </Td> </Tr> </Table> HERO + LCD ( edit ) <P> In June 2015 , the company started to sell the GoPro HERO + LCD , which provides video recording at 1080p at 60 fps / and 8 megapixel photos . GoPro HERO + LCD has a touchscreen to preview the shot to frame the scene and letting the user navigate the menu . A new feature in the camera was instant camera editing . GoPro HERO + LCD is waterproof , because it is built directly into a waterproof case ( waterproof to 131 feet ( 40 m ) ) . The device also includes a feature HiLight Tagging and built - in video editing function , which allows the user to put a label on the main points while shooting video or in the process of view , which makes it possible to quickly find desired footage later . It also has built - in Wi - Fi and Bluetooth , and user - friendly modes like QuikCapture , SuperView and Auto Low Light . </P> HERO+ ( edit ) <P> In October 2015 , GoPro released its third entry level camera : GoPro HERO+ . This camera is the same as the previous HERO + LCD with its 1080p 60 fps / 720p 60 fps video resolution , 8 MP / 5 fps burst photo resolution , built - in Wi - Fi and Bluetooth , waterproof up to 40 m and other modes like Superview , Auto Low Light , QuikCapture and Timelapse mode which automatically captures photos at set time intervals from 0.5 to 60 seconds . However , it does not have an LCD built - in touchscreen display and it is slightly lighter than HERO + LCD . The HERO+ weighs 123 g whereas the HERO + LCD weighs 127 g .
