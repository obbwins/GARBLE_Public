CBS aired a second , hour - long episode the next night in order to attract and maintain the audience 's attention . The pilot served more as a made - for - television movie -- or mini-series suggestion -- which could either be developed later into a full series or remain as a stand - alone two - hour movie . CBS ordered the show picked up immediately for the full season . However , the show made some imperative casting changes . Several pilot leads and a few of the supporting cast were replaced . Henry Sanders was recast as Robert E. in place of Ivory Ocean as a less folksy hard - nosed working man ; Orson Bean replaced Guy Boyd as a more fatherly , cynically - comical Loren Bray ; and Colm Meaney was replaced by Jim Knobeloch , a much younger , attractive , and contemptuously stoic Jake Slicker . Likewise , Larry Sellers 's character , a Cheyenne brave called Black Hawk ( listed under the closing credits as such ) who played an auxiliary role as one of Chief Black Kettle 's aides and spoke only their language , was quietly retooled into Cloud Dancing , Sully 's blood brother and a major recurring character , who , in addition to aiding Black Kettle , plays a large role in quelling the tribulations of the Cheyenne and other neighboring tribes . He also acquired the ability to speak English , allowing him to act as a liaison alongside Sully . His character 's name was never spoken on - screen during his first appearance , which can cause viewers to inadvertently re-interpret this look - alike as Cloud Dancing 's first appearance before his formal debut . </P> <H3> Casting ( edit ) </H3> <P> Veteran actress Jane Seymour , labeled a mini-series `` queen '' , was a last - minute casting choice for Michaela Quinn after reading the script only a day before production was set to begin on the pilot . She was instructed beforehand to review the script and make a decision of whether or not she felt the role was right for her , and , if so , that she truly wanted to commit to the strict contract Sullivan had demanded for the title character . The next day she began the wardrobe fittings for the series . </P> Colleen portrayer changes ( edit ) <P> There were various cast changes of minor characters during the series . The most controversial change took place during the show 's third season , when the character of Colleen Cooper was recast halfway through the year . Unlike the other actors , who signed five - year contracts with the show , Erika Flores was hesitant . She asked to be offered a contract of less than five years . Rumors circulated that Flores 's father gave her an ultimatum to end the contract unless they offered her more money , or he would cut her off financially . Flores has denied such rumors , saying that she left the series for personal reasons and to pursue other opportunities . </P> <P> Beth Sullivan decided that she wanted the character to continue instead of being killed off or sent away . As a result , Jessica Bowman was cast as the new Colleen in Flores 's place . Some of Erika Flores 's fans were quite vocal in their anger over the change and wrote to CBS demanding to know why the actress had been replaced . The producers of the show felt that Jessica Bowman had the ability to successfully recreate the character on her own . </P> Other cast changes ( edit ) <P> Numerous cast changes occurred throughout the series , although none was as significant . Most notable was the replacement of Jane Wyman as Michaela 's mother , Elizabeth Quinn . Wyman signed on to play the role for the third episode of Dr. Quinn in season one . Later Wyman turned down an invitation to return for another guest appearance in season two , as she had retired completely from acting by this stage ( her previous appearance in season one marked her final acting role of any kind ) . Georgann Johnson was hired to replace Wyman in the role and continued throughout the remainder of the series , making one guest appearance each season and appearing in the final Dr. Quinn television movie . </P> <P> Michelle Bonilla originated the role of Theresa Morales in season five and was replaced by Alex Meneses in season six . Bonilla was abruptly let go for reasons that were never publicly stated . Meneses 's portrayal was well received and she was featured throughout the sixth season , when her character fell in love with Jake Slicker . </P> <P> The role of Anthony ( Grace and Robert E. 's adopted son ) was played by Brenden Jefferson for four episodes in season four . He was replaced by Brandon Hammond , who continued in the role throughout seasons five and six . </P> <P> Jennifer Youngs did not begin playing Ingrid until the character 's second appearance ; the first time the character appeared , she was played by Ashley Jones . </P> <H3> Themes ( edit ) </H3> <P> Dr. Quinn was best known for its large , supporting cast , and its high - concept storytelling . The series often used its semi-historical setting as a vehicle to address issues of gender and race within the community . For example , one episode took on homophobia when the famous poet Walt Whitman came to town . Religion played a somewhat minor role in the series , but was also used to address certain issues and new ideas . </P> <P> In the season - three finale , `` For Better or Worse '' , Michaela and Sully were married during a special two - hour episode . During season four , Seymour 's real - life pregnancy was written into the show . The following season saw the birth of Michaela and Sully 's daughter , Katie . </P> <H2> Broadcast history ( edit ) </H2> <P> During its entire original run on CBS , the show aired from 8 -- 9 pm Eastern time on Saturday nights . It was the last successful TV Western drama to date until the premiere of Deadwood on HBO in March 21 , 2004 , and the premiere AMC Western series Hell on Wheels on November 6 , 2011 ; and also one of the last original series to find long - term success in a Saturday timeslot . </P> <H2> Reception ( edit ) </H2> <P> Dr. Quinn was one of the few dramatic shows that allowed fans full access to their filming sets at the Paramount Ranch in Agoura Hills , California . Fans were permitted , often invited , to watch episodes being shot each week . Cast members were known to speak with their fans and sign autographs during shooting breaks . During the show 's final season run , an official website was established , which remains active . Two fans went on to create the Dr. Quinn Times , a newsletter in which interviews with the cast , producers , directors , and technical specialists were conducted and distributed to fans , twice each year . </P> <P> Seymour and Barbara Babcock were the only cast members to receive Emmy nominations for their work on the series . Seymour was nominated several times during the series ' run , while Babcock received a single nomination in 1995 for the episode entitled `` Ladies ' Night '' . Her character , Dorothy Jennings , underwent a mastectomy . </P> <P> The show did win many technical awards , as well as hair and make - up honors . Seymour also won a Golden Globe in 1996 for her portrayal of Michaela Quinn . </P> <H3> Ratings ( edit ) </H3> <Table> <Tr> <Th_colspan=\"2\"> Season </Th> <Th> U.S. ratings </Th> <Th> Rank </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> N / A </Td> <Td> # 19 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> 1993 -- 94 </Td> <Td> 13.46 million </Td> <Td> # 25 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> 1994 -- 95 </Td> <Td> 10.7 million </Td> <Td> # 49 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> 1995 -- 96 </Td> <Td> 9.6 million </Td> <Td> # 55 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 5 </Td> <Td> 1996 -- 97 </Td> <Td> 8.5 million </Td> <Td> # 58 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 6 </Td> <Td> 1997 -- 98 </Td> <Td> 11.7 million </Td> <Td> # 51 </Td> </Tr> </Table> <H3> Demographics change and cancellation ( edit ) </H3> <P> The show was a major hit in the United States for CBS and drew large ratings even though it aired on Saturday nights . Despite the high ratings , CBS claimed that the demographics changed during the show 's run . During its final season , the majority of Dr. Quinn 's viewers were women 40 years of age and older , and not the male and female 18 - to - 49 demographic that networks try to reach . In response , CBS ordered the writers to give the show a slightly darker feel than in previous seasons . As a result , season six was darker than any previous season , with the death of several characters as well as some highly sensitive subject matter : the painful miscarriage of Michaela 's second child , as well as an episode entitled Point Blank , where Michaela was shot by a man and then later developed post-traumatic stress disorder . Many fans did not like the changes , while others felt that the tensions and high drama benefited the show after the overall pleasant past seasons . Despite these opposing opinions , the ratings still proved to be steady and consistent ( finishing at # 51 for the year ) . The series was suddenly canceled in 1998 after its sixth season . Despite this , the series concluded on a bookend by seeing Colleen marry Andrew and prepare to embark as a doctor in her own right , following her adoptive mother 's footsteps . </P> <P> There is still an active fan club for William Shockley , who played Hank Lawson on the show , known as `` Hank 's Hussies . '' In January 2014 , they attended a red carpet movie premiere together in Nashville for his new movie . </P> <H2> Post-series ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Syndication ( edit ) </H3> <P> The show has enjoyed strong ratings in reruns . Dr. Quinn was one of the rare instances of a show entering rerun syndication in the middle of a TV season . It debuted reruns in most American markets on Monday , December 30 , 1996 , just two days shy of the show 's 4th anniversary . With 4 seasons being the minimum requirement for syndication pickup , Dr. Quinn reruns could have started at the more traditional launch date of September 1996 , but the show 's distributor , like many , had an additional minimum episode limit in order for the show to be eligible for syndication . This episode count was not reached until several episodes into Dr. Quinn 's fifth season ( 1996 -- 1997 ) , and since stations had already purchased the show at the beginning of that season , the distributor decided not to hold off until the next fall and let the stations start airing reruns right away . </P> <P> When PAX TV launched in August 1998 , it acquired reruns of current family - friendly series from CBS , including Dr. Quinn . Because dedicated Dr. Quinn fans were angered by the show 's cancellation by CBS that year , these national reruns via PAX helped relieve the blow , especially in markets where local stations were not airing reruns in syndication . </P> <P> Until late 2005 , the Hallmark Channel aired it daily , but in late 2005 Hallmark removed Dr. Quinn from its lineup , citing a drop in viewership . It is also believed that the high cost in Dr. Quinn distribution rights played a role in its removal . Dr. Quinn continues to be seen throughout the world and has been translated to several languages . </P> <P> Starting in June 2009 , the Gospel Music Channel began airing Dr. Quinn weekdays at 5 : 00 and 6 : 00 . More recently Vision TV Canada began airing Dr Quinn week nights at 6PM AT . It also airs on CHNU10 in the Lower Mainland of BC , Canada , at 3 PM PST Weekdays . It has also been shown continuously in Denmark since 2001 , with plans on to keep it at its daily broadcast time of 1 : 00 , Monday to Friday , on Danish TV station , tv2 . </P> <P> Since the last movie in 2001 , many of the show 's cast members have expressed interest in reprising their roles and would like to do another reunion movie , or even a new season . Jane Seymour , Joe Lando , Chad Allen , and other cast members have stated they would all like to work together again and would reprise their Dr. Quinn roles if the opportunity arises . The show 's creator , Beth Sullivan , has also stated her interest in writing another Dr. Quinn movie . </P> <P> In 2003 , A&E Network managed to buy the distribution rights for Dr. Quinn , Medicine Woman from CBS . All six seasons plus the two made - for - TV movies have been released on DVD . The series appears on the GMC Network . GMC aired all the series episodes , including the season - six episodes not shown in a decade , during the summer of 2010 . Joe Lando did several teasers and promotions for the weekend marathons , and says he finds GMC 's ad campaign `` funny '' , saying : `` Truthfully , I have n't had that many opportunities to make fun of Sully . No one 's really found me that funny . But it 's fun to do it now . GMC came up with a great ad campaign . My kids were entertained by it and my wife got a kick out of it . '' </P> <H3> Movies ( edit ) </H3> Dr. Quinn : Revolutions ( edit ) <P> The cancellation of Dr. Quinn caused a massive fan uproar , the likes of which had not been seen since Star Trek in the 1960s . CBS decided that instead of producing another season , as the cost involved was deemed too high , it would instead produce a TV movie . In May 1999 , one year after its cancellation , CBS aired Dr. Quinn : Revolutions , a television movie special , set in 1877 . However , the actual date should have been 1875 , two years following the final episode , which would have been in 1873 . In this TV movie , Katie Sully , now age 4 , is kidnapped , and Dr. Mike and Sully , with help from some townsfolk , embark on a desperate search for their missing daughter in Mexico . Fans were delighted that a special movie was being produced , but they were not altogether impressed with its overall concept . The movie was very different in tone from the rest of the series , incorporating more guns and violence in an effort to please the twenty - something male audience demographics . Furthermore , both Jessica Bowman and Chad Allen declined appearances in that episode , due to its content , and William Olvis ' entire score was scrapped in favor of more cost - effective music that was completely unlike that of the original series . </P> <P> Fans were shocked to find a Dr. Quinn episode that did not include the main title sequence or theme . Moreover , the script , acting , and interpretations of the original characters came across as unfamiliar and very unlike their portrayals in the series . Beth Sullivan was so furious with CBS 's control over the whole project that she declined any involvement . It was critically panned and failed in the ratings . Following this backlash from having excessive creative say over the film , CBS profoundly softened its involvement with the next attempt to produce a TV movie . </P> Dr. Quinn : the Heart Within ( edit ) <P> A second TV movie entitled Dr Quinn : The Heart Within , aired in May 2001 . The movie was set a year after Revolutions , making it 9 years since the first episode of Dr. Quinn in the year 1876 . This time around , CBS gave Beth Sullivan total creative control ; however , there were some strong ground rules . To save money , the movie had to be filmed in Canada , and only the principal cast could be involved . Jane Seymour also served as an executive producer . The plot revolved around Michaela and the Sully family returning to Boston to attend Colleen 's graduation from Harvard Medical School . Having transferred from The Women 's Medical College to the male dominated university since the series finale , Colleen has met harsh criticism from the board as well as from Andrew 's father , who resents the fact that she continues to pursue medicine , despite his misgivings . Unfortunately , Michaela 's mother , Elizabeth , has fallen ill due to a heart condition , and eventually passes , leaving her entire estate to Michaela to establish a hospital back in Colorado Springs , echoing the demise of her father at the very beginning of the series . Colleen soon finds herself in a situation similar to the one her mother , Michaela , had just nine years earlier -- in the same Bostonian sector -- in that she is not respected or taken seriously as a woman doctor . </P> <P> The movie is a proper finale to the series , depicting the now - adult Cooper children 's farewell to Colorado Springs , and finding their new futures in Boston , while Michaela and Sully inevitably return to Colorado Springs to begin a new chapter in their own , now older , adult lives . </P> <P> While this movie was far better received by fans , they did complain that more of the townspeople and original supporting cast were not involved , due to CBS 's demands , as well as the last - minute absence of Chad Allen 's Matthew ( Allen had declined after learning that none of his original supporting costars were offered any appearances ) . Despite these criticisms , the movie was a success . It was filmed in Montreal , Quebec , Canada . </P> <H2> Historical facts and filming information ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> While much of Dr. Quinn was fictional , some of the events and people were based on historical fact : <Ul> <Li> Women 's Medical College of Pennsylvania actually existed and is today part of Drexel University College of Medicine . </Li> <Li> The Sand Creek Massacre in 1864 was referred to in the pilot episode ( though it was historically inaccurate as the pilot took place in 1867 ) . </Li> <Li> Lieutenant Colonel George Armstrong Custer , and Chief Black Kettle , are true historical figures . </Li> <Li> The Battle of Washita River , seen in the third - season episode Washita , was an actual historical event . In the show , the battle took place in 1869 in Colorado , while in fact it took place in the fall of 1868 in Oklahoma . </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> In what most consider the final episode of the series , the town 's often - antagonist banker , Preston A. Lodge III , went bankrupt as a result of the great stock market crash , caused by the Panic of 1873 , a historically - accurate event . Lodge lost much of the townspeople 's money along with his own , in the Panic . </Li> <Li> The episode The Body Electric features Walt Whitman , who was a poet and a true historical figure . </Li> <Li> One of the major historical oversights of the show is that Colorado Springs was not technically founded until 1871 , by General William Palmer , and was mainly a resort town . There were no saloons , as Palmer declared Colorado Springs to be alcohol - free . Colorado Springs stayed `` dry '' until the end of Prohibition in 1933 . However , nearby towns , including Old Colorado City and Manitou Springs did permit saloons . </Li> <Li> Dr. Quinn was largely filmed at the western set on Paramount Ranch in Agoura Hills . Fans of the show were able to visit the sets , talk to the actors , and watch episodes being shot during its six - year run . Since Dr. Quinn ended , the ranch has been used numerous times for other filming projects . Numerous buildings , including the church , Sully 's homestead , the school house , and the Spring Chateau Resort , were leveled soon after the series was canceled . However , the entire town still remains . Despite minor changes over the years , it is still recognizable as the Dr. Quinn set , and is a popular tourist attraction for many fans today . </Li> <Li> Other areas used throughout the series were the back lot at Universal Studios in Hollywood , including the New England street as the location of Quinn family home ; and the New York streets , doubling as the streets of Boston and Washington . The setting of Boston in the final movie was filmed in Canada , using various locations in Old Montreal . </Li> <Li> William Olvis wrote the underscoring music for the series , except for a few episodes in season one ( where he either alternated with Star Trek spin - off series composer David Bell , or co-scored with Bell ) and the Revolutions movie . </Li> <Li> Jane Seymour 's husband , James Keach , directed and produced numerous episodes of the show , and guest starred in the season 5 episode entitled , `` The Hostage . '' </Li> <Li> Due to child labor laws , the role of Katie , Dr. Mike and Sully 's young daughter , was portrayed by identical triplets : Alexandria , McKenzie , and Megan Calabrese . </Li> <Li> Jane Seymour is the only cast member who appeared in every episode of the series . Shawn Toovey missed only one episode as did Chad Allen , who also did not appear in episode titled `` Reunion '' ( Season 4 ) , as well as the two made - for - TV movies . Joe Lando came in third , missing only a few episodes in the sixth and final season . </Li> <Li> Starting in season 5 , several episodes featured real world trivia relevant to the episode 's context , usually about medical knowledge . These segments would appear at the end of the episode in the form of white text on a black background , narrated by Jane Seymour . In the episode `` A Place to Die '' , the inclusion of the trivia was particularly significant because it revealed that Dr. Mike 's practice was besieged by a staph infection , a malady that was completely unknown at the time .

Some of the other regular Dr. Quinn characters , including the ones of Jane Seymour , Joe Lando , Jim Knobeloch , Frank Collison and Orson Bean , were in as well . </P> <P> It was directed by Jerry London , with Robert Brooks Mendel as the first assistant director , Timothy O. Johnson as the executive producer , and Beth Sullivan as the producer . The rest of the cast members were Laura Harring ( Christina Guevara ) , Edward Albert ( Ted McKay ) , James Brolin ( Sheriff ) , Eddie Albert ( Ben McKay ) , Carlos G\u00f3mez ( Father Thomas Guevara ) and John Saxon ( Rafael Guevara ) . </P> <P> The show was entitled California and it is likely that only the pilot episode was filmed . It remains unclear whether it has ever aired on television . It was available on YouTube for a time but has since disappeared except for a couple of clips . </P> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Television in the United States portal </Li> <Li> 1990s portal </Li> </Ul> <Ul> <Li> List of Dr. Quinn , Medicine Woman episodes </Li> <Li> Bramwell , British television series based on the same premise . </Li> </Ul> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ Lowry , Brian ( May 27 , 1998 ) . `` Fans , Seymour Rally Against ' Dr. Quinn 's ' Cancellation '' .
