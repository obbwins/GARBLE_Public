For example , they resisted the network 's suggestion that they have Britney Spears appear as a waitress in one episode ; they thought such appearances would detract from the show 's realism . </P> <P> Several of the screenwriters appeared on the show . Mike White played Kim Kelly 's oft - discussed injured brother , and first appeared in episode 4 , `` Kim Kelly is My Friend . '' Paul Feig , Gabe Sachs , and series composer Michael Andrews appear uncredited as members of the fictional band Dimension in `` I 'm With the Band . '' </P> <H2> Episodes ( edit ) </H2> <P> The script for the pilot episode of Freaks and Geeks was written by Paul Feig as a spec script . Feig gave the script to producer Judd Apatow , who sold it to DreamWorks , where Apatow was under an overall deal . DreamWorks sold it to NBC , who greenlit a pilot . Before the script was shot , Feig wrote a second episode at the behest of Apatow . He showed this second script to Apatow and pilot director Jake Kasdan , and they suggested that he combine the two episodes to form a stronger pilot . Notable additions include the introduction of Kim Kelly and Lindsay 's recollection of her grandmother 's death . Feig wrote a final draft after a read - through with the cast , this time incorporating a first meeting between Lindsay and the freaks ( in previous drafts , Lindsay was already part of the group ) . </P> <P> The show ran for 18 episodes , three of which -- `` Kim Kelly Is My Friend , '' `` Dead Dogs and Gym Teachers , '' and `` Noshing and Moshing '' -- were unaired by NBC and not seen until Fox Family ran the show in 2000 . The final three episodes premiered at the Museum of Television and Radio , prior to being broadcast on television .

Factory and Sony BMG Music Entertainment . A limited `` yearbook edition '' set including two additional discs was also available through the official website for the show . Fans who had signed an online petition to get the show on DVD got priority in purchasing the special set . </P> <P> On November 25 , 2008 , the deluxe `` Yearbook Edition '' boxed set was re-released through Vivendi Entertainment . The set features all of the episodes , commentaries , and special features of the `` Complete Series '' six - DVD set , plus two extra discs and deluxe packaging . It is packaged as an 80 - page color yearbook with essays , pictures , and episode synopses . </P> <P> In July 2015 , Shout ! Factory announced it had begun preparing for a Blu - ray release of the series . It was subsequently confirmed in December 2015 , that Shout ! would release the complete series on Blu - ray on March 22 , 2016 , and the set contains all special features from the previous releases and the episodes in both its original aspect ratio and widescreen . </P> <H3> Books ( edit ) </H3> <P> In October 2004 , Newmarket Press released two Freaks and Geeks books : Freaks and Geeks : The Complete Scripts , Volume 1 and Freaks and Geeks : The Complete Scripts , Volume 2 . Each book covers nine scripts from the series , compiled by Paul Feig and Judd Apatow . Extra content includes behind - the - scenes memos and notes ; photos ; additional plot lines ; and excerpts from the Freaks and Geeks series bibles . </P> <H3> Soundtrack ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Freaks and Geeks ( soundtrack ) <P> Freaks and Geeks ' creators made it a priority to feature genuine , period - specific music that would help to create the show 's tone . Clearing such names as Billy Joel , Cheap Trick , the Grateful Dead , Rush , Styx , The Moody Blues , The Who , and Van Halen required much of the show 's budget . Eventually , this became an obstacle in releasing the show on DVD due to the difficulty and expense of clearing all of the music rights for the series . Many television shows ( such as Dawson 's Creek , WKRP in Cincinnati , and Daria ) had music cues changed or removed in order to facilitate relatively inexpensive DVD releases , as was done for Freaks and Geeks when it was seen in reruns on Fox Family . However , Freaks and Geeks ' creators chose to wait to release the DVD until they could find a company willing to pay for the original music . Shout ! Factory , a music and video company specializing in comprehensive reissues and compilations , eventually brought Freaks and Geeks to DVD with all of its music intact . </P> <H2> Appearances ( edit ) </H2> <P> In 2000 , the cast of Freaks and Geeks was featured in an episode of the game show Family Feud hosted by Louie Anderson . </P> <H2> Reception ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Critical reception ( edit ) </H3> <P> At Metacritic , Freaks and Geeks has a score of 88 out of 100 , based on 26 reviews , indicating `` universal acclaim '' . </P> <H3> Ratings ( edit ) </H3> <P> The show averaged 6.77 million viewers and was # 93 in the rankings during its only season . </P> <H3> Awards and nominations ( edit ) </H3> <P> The series received three Emmy Award nominations : creator Paul Feig was nominated twice for Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series , for `` Pilot '' and `` Discos and Dragons .

It was nominated for two Television Critics Association Awards , for New Program of the Year and Outstanding Achievement in Drama . For acting , the series won for Best Family TV Series -- Comedy and was nominated for Best Performance in a TV Series -- Young Ensemble at the Young Artist Awards . For the YoungStar Awards , John Francis Daley and Sarah Hagan were nominated for Best Young Actor / Performance in a Comedy TV Series and the ensemble was nominated for Best Young Ensemble Cast -- Television . The series also received several other nominations in other categories . </P> <P> The series appeared on Time magazine 's 2007 `` 100 Greatest Shows of All Time '' list , and placed third on the magazine 's list of greatest television shows of the 2000s ( decade ) . In 2007 , Freaks and Geeks ranked # 21 on TV Guide 's Top Cult Shows Ever . In 2008 , Entertainment Weekly ranked it the 13th - best series of the past 25 years . The same year , AOL TV named it the Best School Show of All Time . In 2013 TV Guide included it in its list of The 60 Greatest Dramas of All Time , and ranked it # 1 on their list of 60 shows that were `` Cancelled Too Soon . '' It launched several of its young actors , such as Rogan and Franco , into successful acting careers . </P> <H2> Cancellation and future ( edit ) </H2> <P> One of the cited reasons for its early cancellation was its inability to gain an audience due to its `` erratic scheduling '' and poor time slots , competing with the high - rated Who Wants to Be a Millionaire . The producers created a website for the series , but NBC would not share its URL because `` they did n't want people to know the Internet existed . They were worried about losing viewers to it '' as explained by Judd Apatow . Freaks and Geeks was only averaging under 7 million viewers , while other NBC series such as Frasier and Friends were averaging over 14 million viewers each . </P> <P> NBC and the creative directors of Freaks and Geeks did not have the same vision for the series . After the network picked up the Freaks and Geeks pilot , Garth Ancier replaced the old NBC network 's president . Ancier `` did n't understand public school life '' and its relevance because he went to a boarding school and then on to Princeton . Creator Paul Feig expressed the `` irony of the situation '' as everyone involved wanted Freaks and Geeks to be a success , but the network did n't understand the concept of realistically showcasing life as ordinary teenagers . Jake Kasdan and Judd Apatow had multiple arguments with the network concerning `` lack of victories '' in the script and that the characters needed to `` be cool . '' The writers wanted to produce something that would represent the average high school experience , but the network wanted to produce something that would make high school seem cool . Because the network did not think the series would be a success , they let the writers add things to the script that they `` would n't have if they thought the show would resurface the next season , '' like the use of the phrase , `` ambiguous genitalia . '' Apatow said in 2014 that `` Everything I 've done , in a way , is revenge for the people who cancelled Freaks and Geeks . </P> <H3> Undeclared ( edit ) </H3> <P> In 2001 , several of the actors featured in Freaks and Geeks appeared in a new Judd Apatow college half - hour comedy Undeclared , which aired on Fox Network . Apatow fought with the network to include Freaks and Geeks actors , but the network only picked up Seth Rogen ( who was already committed to the show as a writer ) as a regular cast member . However , Jason Segel became a recurring character , and Samm Levine , Busy Philipps , and Natasha Melnick guest - starred in multi-episode arcs , as did prominent Freaks and Geeks guest stars Steve Bannos ( who played McKinley High math teacher Mr. Frank Kowchevski ) and David Krumholtz ( who played Neal 's older brother , Barry Schweiber ) . Martin Starr was prominent in another episode , and a scene with Sarah Hagan was shot , although it was cut for television broadcast . The show was also canceled during its first season . </P> <H3> Syndication and cast reunions ( edit ) </H3> Cast of Freaks and Geeks at PaleyFest 2011 <P> In June 2010 , it was announced that IFC had acquired the rights to air both Freaks and Geeks and Undeclared . Freaks and Geeks 's 18 - episode run on IFC finished with all episodes having aired as of October 29 , 2010 . Undeclared 's IFC run began on November 5 , 2010 . Both shows have also joined TeenNick 's line - up as of June 13 , 2011 . Freaks and Geeks aired on FXX , from 2013 to 2014 . </P> <P> A reunion of several cast members and producers of both shows took place at the Paley Center for Media 's PaleyFest on March 12 , 2011 . </P> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ Coffin J.
