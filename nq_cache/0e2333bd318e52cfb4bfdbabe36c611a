It was built during the 27th century BC for the burial of Pharaoh Djoser by his vizier , Imhotep . It is the central feature of a vast mortuary complex in an enormous courtyard surrounded by ceremonial structures and decoration . </P> <P> This first Egyptian pyramid consisted of six mastabas ( of decreasing size ) built atop one another in what were clearly revisions and developments of the original plan . It is seven levels high and four - sided . The pyramid originally stood 62 metres ( 203 ft ) tall , with a base of 109 m \u00d7 125 m ( 358 ft \u00d7 410 ft ) and was clad in polished white limestone . The step pyramid ( or proto - pyramid ) is considered to be the earliest large - scale cut stone construction , although the pyramids at Caral in South America are contemporary and the nearby enclosure known as Gisr el - mudir would seem to predate the complex . </P> Perspective view , plan and elevation images Djoser 's Pyramid Complex taken from a 3d model <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Djoser </Li> <Li> 2 Precedents </Li> <Li> 3 Overview <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Enclosure wall </Li> <Li> 3.2 Great Trench </Li> <Li> 3.3 Roofed colonnade entrance </Li> <Li> 3.4 South Court </Li> <Li> 3.5 South Tomb </Li> <Li> 3.6 Step Pyramid </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Pyramid substructure <Ul> <Li> 4.1 Burial chamber </Li> <Li> 4.2 North Temple and Serdab Court </Li> <Li> 4.3 Heb - sed Court </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 5 References </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Djoser ( edit ) </H2> <P> Djoser was the first or second king of the 3rd Dynasty ( ca . 2667 to 2648 BC ) of the Egyptian Old Kingdom ( ca . 2686 to 2125 BC ) . He is believed to have ruled for 19 years or , if the 19 years were biennial taxation years , 38 years . He reigned long enough to allow the grandiose plan for his pyramid to be realized in his lifetime . </P> <P> Djoser is best known for his innovative tomb , which dominates the Saqqara landscape . In this tomb he is referred to by his Horus name Netjeriykhet ; Djoser is a name given by New Kingdom visitors thousands of years later . Djoser 's step pyramid is astounding in its departure from previous architecture . It sets several important precedents , perhaps the most important of which is its status as the first monumental structure made of stone . The social implications of such a large and carefully sculpted stone structure are staggering . The process of building such a structure would be far more labor - intensive than previous monuments of mud - brick . This suggests that the state , and therefore the royal government had a new level of control of resources , both material and human . Also , from this point on , kings of the Old Kingdom are buried in the North , rather than at Abydos . Furthermore , although the plan of Djoser 's pyramid complex is different than later complexes , many elements persist and the step pyramid sets the stage for later pyramids of the 4th , 5th , and 6th Dynasties , including the great pyramids of Giza . Finally , another intriguing first is the identification of the architect Imhotep , who is credited with the design and construction of the complex . </P> <H2> Precedents ( edit ) </H2> <P> Djoser 's Pyramid draws ideas from several precedents . The most relevant precedent is found at Saqqara mastaba 3038 . The substructure lay in a 4m deep rectangular pit , and had mudbrick walls rising to 6 m . Three sides were extended and built out to create eight shallow steps rising at an angle of 49 \u00b0 . This would have been an elongated step pyramid if the remaining side had not been left uncovered . In another parallel to Djoser 's complex , to complete this mastaba complex a niched enclosure wall was erected . </P> Comparison of approximate profiles of the Pyramid of Djoser with some notable pyramidal or near - pyramidal buildings .

Step Pyramid Complex , Saqqara . Temples of the festival complex . <P> Djoser 's Step Pyramid complex has several structures pivotal to its function in both life and the afterlife . Several are discussed below with attention paid to function and form . The pyramid was not simply a grave in ancient Egypt . Its purpose was to facilitate a successful afterlife for the king so that he could be eternally reborn . The symbolism of the step pyramid form , which did not survive the 3rd Dynasty , is unknown , but it has been suggested that it may be a monumental symbol of the crown , especially the royal mortuary cult , since seven small step pyramids ( not tombs ) were built in the provinces . Another well accepted theory is that it facilitated the king 's ascension to join the eternal North Star . </P> <P> The main excavator of the Step Pyramid was Jean - Philippe Lauer , a French architect who reconstructed key portions of the complex . The complex covers 15ha and is about 2.5 times as large as the Old Kingdom town of Heirakonpolis . Several features of the complex differ from those of later Old Kingdom pyramids . The pyramid temple is situated at the north side of the pyramid , whereas in later pyramids it is on the east side . Also , the Djoser complex is built on a North - South axis whereas later complexes utilize an East - West axis . Furthermore , the Djoser complex has one niched enclosure wall , whereas later pyramids have two enclosure walls with the outside one being smooth and the inside one sometimes niched . </P> <H3> Enclosure wall ( edit ) </H3> <P> The Djoser complex is surrounded by a wall of light Tura limestone 10.5 m high . The wall design recalls the appearance of 1st Dynasty tombs , with the distinctive paneled construction known as the palace fa\u00e7ade , which imitates bound bundles of reeds . The overall structure imitates mudbrick . The wall is interrupted by 14 doors , however only one entrance , in the south corner of the east fa\u00e7ade , is functional for the living . This arrangement resembles Early Dynastic funerary enclosures at Abydos in which the entrance was on the east side . The remaining doors are known as false doors , and were meant for the king 's use in the afterlife . They functioned as portals through which the king 's ka could pass between life and the afterlife . The functional door at the southeast end of the complex leads to a narrow passageway that connects to the roofed colonnade . </P> <H3> Great trench ( edit ) </H3> <P> Outside the enclosure wall , Djoser 's complex is completely surrounded by a trench dug in the underlying rock . The trench measures 750 m long and 40 m wide and is a rectangle on a North - South axis . The walls of the trench were originally decorated with niches and its function seems to have been to make entry into the complex more difficult . </P> <H3> Roofed colonnade entrance ( edit ) </H3> Roofed colonnade corridor leading into the complex , with stone pillars carved to imitate bundled plant stems . <P> The roofed colonnade led from the enclosure wall to the south of the complex . A passageway with a limestone ceiling constructed to look as though it was made from whole tree trunks led to a massive stone imitation of two open doors . Beyond this portal was a hall with twenty pairs of limestone columns composed of drum shaped segments built to look like bundles of plant stems and reaching a height of 6.6 m . The columns were not free - standing , but were attached to the wall by masonry projections . Between the columns on both sides of the hall were small chambers , which some Egyptologists propose may have been for each of the provinces of Upper and Lower Egypt . At the end of the colonnade was the transverse hypostyle room with eight columns connected in pairs by blocks of limestone . This led to the South Court . </P> <H3> South court ( edit ) </H3> <P> The South Court is a large court between the South Tomb and the pyramid . Within the court are curved stones thought to be territorial markers associated with the Heb - sed festival , an important ritual completed by Egyptian kings ( typically after 30 years on the throne ) to renew their powers . These would have allowed Djoser to claim control over all of Egypt , while its presence in the funerary complex would allow Djoser to continue to benefit from the ritual in the afterlife . At the southern end of the court was a platform approached by steps . It has been suggested that this was a platform for the double throne . This fits into the theory proposed by Barry Kemp , and generally accepted by many , that suggests the whole step pyramid complex symbolizes the royal palace enclosure and allows the king to eternally perform the rituals associated with kingship . At the very south of the South Court lay the South Tomb . </P> <H3> South Tomb ( edit ) </H3> Relief of Djoser facing the temple of Horus of Behedet ( modern Edfu ) in a blue faience chamber of the south tomb . <P> The South Tomb has been likened to the satellite pyramids of later Dynasties , and has been proposed to house the ka in the afterlife . Another proposal is that it may have held the canopic jar with the king 's organs , but this does not follow later trends where the canopic jar is found in the same place as the body . These proposals stem from the fact that the granite burial vault is much too small to have facilitated an actual burial . </P> <P> The substructure of the South Tomb is entered through a tunnel - like corridor with a staircase that descends about 30m before opening up into the pink granite burial chamber . The staircase then continues west and leads to a gallery that imitates the blue chambers below the step pyramid . </P> <P> Current evidence suggests that the South Tomb was finished before the pyramid . The symbolic king 's inner palace , decorated in blue faience , is much more complete than that of the pyramid . Three chambers of this substructure are decorated in blue faience to imitate reed - mat facades , just like the pyramid . One room is decorated with three finely niche reliefs of the king , one depicting him running the Heb - sed . Importantly , Egyptian builders chose to employ their most skilled artisans and depict their finest art in the darkest , most inaccessible place in the complex . This highlights the fact that this impressive craftsmanship was not meant for the benefit of the living but was meant to ensure the king had all the tools necessary for a successful afterlife . </P> <H3> Step pyramid ( edit ) </H3> <P> The design of the Step Pyramid used royal cubits . The superstructure of the Step Pyramid is six steps / seven levels ( including rooftop ) and was built in six stages , as might be expected with an experimental structure . The pyramid began as a square mastaba ( this designation as a mastaba is contended for several reasons ) ( M1 ) which was gradually enlarged , first evenly on all four sides ( M2 ) and later just on the east side ( M3 ) . The mastaba was built up in two stages , first to form a four - stepped structure ( P1 ) and then to form a six - stepped structure ( P2 ) , which now had a rectangular base on an east -- west axis . The fact that the initial mastaba was square has led many to believe that the monument was never meant to be a mastaba , as no other known mastabas had ever been square . When the builders began to transform the mastaba into the four step pyramid , they made a major shift in construction . Like in the construction of the mastaba , they built a crude core of rough stones and then cased them in fine limestone with packing in between . The major difference is that in mastaba construction they laid horizontal courses , but for the pyramid layers , they built in accretion layers that leaned inwards , while using blocks that were both bigger and higher quality . Much of the rock for the pyramid was likely quarried from the construction of the great trench . It is widely accepted that ramps would have been used to raise heavy stone to construct the pyramid , and many plausible models have been suggested . Apparatuses like rollers in which the heavy stone could be placed and then rolled were employed in transport . </P> <H2> Pyramid substructure ( edit ) </H2> <P> Under the step pyramid is a labyrinth of tunneled chambers and galleries that total nearly 6 km in length and connect to a central shaft 7 m square and 28 m deep . These spaces provide room for the king 's burial , the burial of family members , and the storage of goods and offerings . The entrance to the 28 m shaft was built on the north side of the pyramid , a trend that would remain throughout the Old Kingdom . The sides of the underground passages are limestone inlaid with blue faience tile to replicate reed matting . These `` palace fa\u00e7ade '' walls are further decorated by panels decorated in low relief that show the king participating in the Heb - sed . Together these chambers constitute the funerary apartment that mimicked the palace and would serve as the living place of the royal ka . On the east side of the pyramid eleven shafts 32 m deep were constructed and annexed to horizontal tunnels for the royal harem ( The existence of this `` harem '' is debated ) . These were incorporated into the preexisting substructure as it expanded eastward . In the storerooms along here over 40,000 stone vessels were found , many of which predate Djoser . These would have served Djoser 's visceral needs in the afterlife . An extensive network of underground galleries was located to the north , west and south of the central burial chamber and crude horizontal magazines were carved into these . </P> <H3> Burial chamber ( edit ) </H3> <P> The burial chamber was a vault constructed of four courses of well - dressed granite . It had one opening , which was sealed with a 3.5 ton block after the burial . No body was recovered as the tomb had been extensively robbed . Lauer believes that a burial chamber of alabaster existed before the one of granite . He found interesting evidence of limestone blocks with five pointed stars in low relief that were likely on the ceiling , indicating the first occurrence of what would become a tradition . The king sought to associate himself with the eternal North Stars that never set so as to ensure his rebirth and eternity . </P> <H3> North temple and serdab court ( edit ) </H3> <P> The northern ( funerary / mortuary ) temple was on the north side of the pyramid and faced the north stars , which the king wished to join in eternity . This structure provided a place in which the daily rituals and offerings to the dead could be performed , and was the cult center for the king . To the east of the temple is the serdab , which is a small enclosed structure that housed the ka statue . The king 's ka inhabited the ka statue in order to benefit from daily ceremonies like the opening of the mouth , a ceremony that allowed him to breathe and eat , and the burning of incense . He witnessed these ceremonies through two small eye holes cut in the north wall of the serdab . This temple appeared on the north side of the pyramid throughout the Third Dynasty , as the king wished to go north to become one of the eternal stars in the North Sky that never set . In the Fourth Dynasty , when there was a religious shift to an emphasis on rebirth and eternity achieved through the sun , the temple was moved to the east side of the temple where the sun rises , so that through association the king may be reborn every day . </P> <H3> Heb - sed court ( edit ) </H3> <P> The Heb - sed court is rectangular and parallel to the South Courtyard . It was meant to provide a space in which the king could perform the Heb - sed ritual in the afterlife . Flanking the east and west sides of the court are the remains of two groups of chapels , many of which are dummy buildings , of three different architectural styles . At the north and south ends there are three chapels with flat roves and no columns . The remaining chapels on the west side are decorated with fluted columns and capitals flanked by leaves . Each of the chapels has a sanctuary accessed by a roofless passage with walls that depict false doors and latches . Some of these buildings have niches for statues . Egyptologists believe that these buildings were related to the important double coronation of the king during the Heb - sed . </P> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> Wikimedia Commons has media related to Pyramid of Djoser . </Td> </Tr> </Table> <Ol> <Li> ^ Jump up to : Shaw , Ian , ed.
