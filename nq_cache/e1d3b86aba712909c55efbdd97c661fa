The game originated in Canada in the 1930s , where it is more popular than field lacrosse and is the national summer sport . Box lacrosse is played between two teams of five players and one goalie each , and is traditionally played on an ice hockey rink once the ice has been removed or covered . The playing area is called a box , in contrast to the open playing field of field lacrosse . The object of the game is to use a lacrosse stick to catch , carry , and pass the ball in an effort to score by shooting a solid rubber lacrosse ball into the opponent 's goal . </P> <P> The highest levels of box lacrosse are the National Lacrosse League ( NLL ) ( professional ) , Box Lacrosse League ( semi-pro ) , Senior A divisions of the Canadian Lacrosse Association ( semi-pro ) , the Western Lacrosse Association ( semi-pro ) , and Major Series Lacrosse ( semi-pro ) . </P> <P> While there are 59 total members of the Federation of International Lacrosse ( FIL ) , only fifteen have competed in international box lacrosse competition . Only Canada , the Iroquois Nationals and the United States have finished in the top three places at the World Indoor Lacrosse Championships . </P> <H2> Contents </H2> <Ul> <Li> 1 History </Li> <Li> 2 Rules <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Players , equipment and officials <Ul> <Li> 2.1. 1 Goaltender </Li> <Li> 2.1. 2 Defenders </Li> <Li> 2.1. 3 Transition </Li> <Li> 2.1. 4 Forwards </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2.2 Playing area </Li> <Li> 2.3 Duration and tie - breaking methods </Li> <Li> 2.4 Ball in and out of play </Li> <Li> 2.5 Penalties <Ul> <Li> 2.5. 1 Fighting </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 International competition </Li> <Li> 4 Women </Li> <Li> 5 See also </Li> <Li> 6 References <Ul> <Li> 6.1 Footnotes </Li> <Li> 6.2 Bibliography </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 7 External links </Li> </Ul> <H2> History ( edit ) </H2> Ball players , painted by George Catlin , illustrates various Native Americans playing lacrosse . <P> Lacrosse is a traditional indigenous people 's game and was first encountered by Europeans when French Jesuit missionaries in the St. Lawrence Valley witnessed the game in the 1630s . Lacrosse for centuries was seen as a key element of cultural identity and spiritual healing to Native Americans . It originated as a field game and was adopted first by Canadian , American , and English athletes as a field game , eventually settling on a 10 v 10 format . </P> <P> Box lacrosse is a modern version of the game that was invented in Canada during the 1920s and 1930s . The roots of indoor lacrosse are obscure , but its invention has been attributed to one Paddy Brennan , a field lacrosse player and referee from Montreal , who , being annoyed by the constant slowing of play from balls going out of bounds in the field game , experimented with indoor games at the Mount Royal Arena during the early 1920s . </P> <P> Joseph Cattarinich and Leo Dandurand , owners of the National Hockey League 's Montreal Canadiens in the 1920s , led the participating ice hockey arena owners to introduce the new sport . In the 1930s , 6 v 6 indoor lacrosse came to be played in the summer in unused hockey rinks . Canadians adopted the new version of the sport quickly . Eventually , it became the more popular version of the sport in Canada , supplanting field lacrosse . The form was also adopted as the primary version of the game played on Native American reservations in the US and Canada by Iroquois and other Native peoples . It is the only sport in which the American indigenous people are sanctioned to compete internationally , participating as the Iroquois Nationals . However , many field lacrosse enthusiasts viewed the new version of the sport with negativity . </P> <P> The first professional box lacrosse games were held in 1931 . That summer , the arena owners formed the International Lacrosse League , featuring four teams : the Montreal Canadiens , Montreal Maroons , Toronto Maple Leafs , and Cornwall Colts . The league lasted only two seasons . In the wake of the original International Lacrosse League opened the American Box Lacrosse League featuring six teams : two in New York City , and one each in Brooklyn , Toronto , Boston , and Baltimore . The league played to small crowds on outdoor fields such as Yankee Stadium and Fenway Park , before closing midway through its inaugural season . Lacrosse was officially declared Canada 's National Summer Sport with the passage of the National Sports Act ( Bill C - 212 ) on May 12 , 1994 . </P> <P> The first box lacrosse match conducted in Australia came about as part of a fund raising appeal for the Queen Victoria Hospital in Melbourne . The Victorian Lacrosse Association was approached by the appeal committee to stage a lacrosse match as part of a multi sport carnival at the Plaza ( Wattle Path Palais ) ballroom at St Kilda on 1 July 1931 . After a lightning six - a-side ( outdoor ) tournament format was successfully carried out a few weeks prior , it was decided to play six - a-side for this exhibition game between MCC and a composite team from other clubs , with players wearing rubber shoes and using a softer ball for the match . Newspaper articles at the time suggest that the sport may have even been created in Australia , with P.J. Lally of the famous Canadian lacrosse stick manufacturing company requesting a copy of the rules of the game from the VLA Secretary . By 1933 , box lacrosse matches were being played in Adelaide , Brisbane , and Perth . This new version of the game however did not overtake the traditional version of lacrosse in popularity in Australia as happened in Canada . </P> <P> The Canadian Lacrosse Association began sponsoring box lacrosse . In 1932 , the Mann Cup , the most prestigious lacrosse trophy in Canada , was contended for under box lacrosse rules for the first time . Previously , the national senior men 's lacrosse championship , awarded since 1901 , was competed for under field lacrosse rules . The Mann Cup is an annual tournament that presents the champion of the Western Lacrosse Association and Major Series Lacrosse in a best of seven national championship . A few years later , in 1937 , the Minto Cup , began being awarded under box lacrosse rules to the junior men 's champions . Currently the Canadian Lacrosse Association oversees the Mann Cup , the Minto Cup , the Presidents Cup ( Senior B national championship ) the Founders Cup ( Junior B national championship ) all under box lacrosse rules . </P> <P> Briefly in 1939 , a professional box lacrosse league started up in California , called the Pacific Coast Lacrosse Association . This four team league also folded shortly after opening . Professional box lacrosse did not return to the United States again until 1968 when the Portland Adanacs and Detroit Olympics franchises played in the National Lacrosse Association , a circuit that folded after one summer season seaso . </P> National Lacrosse League action during an All - Star Game in 2005 <P> A new professional indoor lacrosse league was created in the 1970s with the formation of the original National Lacrosse League . This league opened in 1974 with teams in Montreal , Toronto , Rochester , Syracuse , Philadelphia , and Maryland . For the 1975 season , Rochester moved to Boston , Syracuse moved to Quebec City , and Toronto moved to Long Island . Thus , by its second year , the original NLL was playing in all major league arenas : the Colis\u00e9e de Qu\u00e9bec , the Montreal Forum , the Boston Garden , Nassau Coliseum , the Spectrum , and the Capital Centre . When the two wealthier ' 75 NLL franchises , Philadelphia and Maryland , finished out of the playoffs , and with Montreal losing access to the fabled Montreal Forum in the upcoming season due to the 1976 Montreal Olympic Games , the league folded after two seasons due to financial uncertainty . </P> <P> The rebirth of professional box lacrosse in the United States came on March 13 , 1986 , with the formation of the Eagle Pro Box Lacrosse League , which was incorporated by Russ Cline and Chris Fritz . The league originated with four teams : the Philadelphia Wings , New Jersey Saints , Washington Wave , and Baltimore Thunder , and unlike box lacrosse generally , was played during the winter . The league rebranded itself as the Major Indoor Lacrosse League ( MILL ) immediately after its inaugural season , and in 1998 renamed itself again , this time to the NLL . In 1998 , the NLL entered into the Canadian market for the first time with the Ontario Raiders . Although 5 of the league 's 9 teams are based in American cities , more than two - thirds of the players are Canadian . </P> <H2> Rules ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Players , equipment and officials ( edit ) </H3> Windsor Clippers ( OJBLL ) runner in 2014 . <P> During play , a team consists of six players : a goaltender and five `` runners '' . A runner is any non-goalkeeper position player , including forwards , transition players , and defenders . Runners usually specialize in one of these roles and substitute off the field when the ball moves from one end to the other . When the sport originated teams played with six runners . However , in 1953 the sixth runner , a position called rover , was eliminated . The goalkeeper can be replaced by another runner , often when a delayed penalty has been called on the other team or at the end of games by teams that are behind to help score goals . </P> <P> A player 's lacrosse stick must be between 40 inches ( 1.0 m ) and 46 inches ( 1.2 m ) in length ( youth levels may use shorter sticks ) . In most box lacrosse leagues , the use of a traditional wooden stick is allowed . However , almost no lacrosse players use wooden sticks anymore , preferring aluminum or another metal , and a plastic head . In the NLL , wooden lacrosse sticks are not allowed . Besides a lacrosse stick , each player must also wear a certain amount of protective equipment , including a lacrosse helmet with facemask , lacrosse gloves , arm and shoulder pads , and back / kidney pads . Rib pads are optional in some leagues . </P> <P> In some box leagues , especially the NLL , the five `` runners '' wear helmets specifically designed for box lacrosse . These helmets consist of a hockey helmet with a box lacrosse face mask attached instead of a hockey cage . </P> <P> During a typical game the number of officials can range from one to three , depending on the league and level of play . In most games there are at least two referees : a lead official and a trail official . In NLL games there are three officials per game . </P> Goaltender ( edit ) See also : Goaltender ( box lacrosse ) St. Catharines Spartans ( OJBLL ) goalie in 2014 . <P> The goaltender 's responsibility is to prevent the opposition from scoring goals by directly defending the net . Box lacrosse goaltenders equipment includes upper body gear ( measuring no more than 3 inches ( 7.6 cm ) up and 5 inches ( 13 cm ) out off the shoulder -- much larger than similar gear for field lacrosse or ice hockey goaltenders ) , large shin guards that must measure no more than 11 inches ( 28 cm ) at the knee , 9 inches ( 23 cm ) at the top of the shin and 7 inches ( 18 cm ) at the ankle , and a field lacrosse helmet or ice hockey goalie mask . </P> <P> The 9 feet ( 2.7 m ) to 9 feet 3 inches ( 2.82 m ) radius area surrounding the net is called the `` crease '' . Players except for the goaltender may not enter the crease while playing the ball . Punishments for crease infractions include a change of possession , resetting of the time - clock , or a possible two - minute penalty depending on the infraction . Opposing players may not make contact with the goaltender while he is in the crease . Once he leaves the crease , however , he loses all goaltender privileges . </P> <P> Even as box lacrosse grows in the United States , the American goalkeeper is a rarity . The skills required to be a successful field lacrosse goaltender and a successful box lacrosse goaltender are very different and do not lend well to one another . </P> Defenders ( edit ) <P> A defender is a player position whose primary responsibility is to prevent the opposing team from scoring . Unlike in field lacrosse where some defensive players carry longer sticks , all box lacrosse defenders play with a maximum 46 inches ( 1.2 m ) long stick . Defensive tactics include cross checking ( where a player uses the shaft of his stick to push the opposition player off balance ) , body checking ( where a player makes contact with the opposition player in order to slow him down ) , and stick checking ( where a player makes contact with the opposition player 's stick in order to knock the ball loose ) . </P> Transition ( edit ) <P> A transition player is a player whose responsibility is primarily to play during defensive situations with an offensive mindset . The goal of this player is to create fastbreaks and scoring opportunities . </P> Forwards ( edit ) <P> A forward is a player position on the field whose responsibility is primarily offensive . Typically , a forward is dominant throwing with one hand or the other , and will primarily play on that side of the floor . Some players , known as creasemen , do not focus on one side or the other . These players instead focus their offensive attention near the crease area in front of the goaltender . </P> <H3> Playing area ( edit ) </H3> Detailed diagram illustrating the differences and similarities between Canadian Lacrosse Association and National Lacrosse League box lacrosse playing areas <P> The playing area of box lacrosse is typically an ice hockey rink during the summer months . The playing surface is usually the concrete floor underneath the melted ice . Generally the playing area is 180 feet ( 55 m ) to 200 feet ( 61 m ) in length and 80 feet ( 24 m ) to 90 feet ( 27 m ) in width . The NLL plays on artificial turf placed on top of the ice . Some leagues , and teams that have dedicated box lacrosse arenas ( such as the Iroquois ) , have outfitted their playing surface with artificial turf similar to the NLL . </P> <P> Box lacrosse goal dimensions are traditionally 4 feet ( 1.2 m ) wide by 4 feet ( 1.2 m ) tall . In the NLL , the dimensions are slightly larger at 4 feet 9 inches ( 1.45 m ) wide by 4 feet ( 1.2 m ) tall . These nets are significantly smaller than field lacrosse nets which measure 6 feet ( 1.8 m ) wide by 6 feet ( 1.8 m ) tall . </P> <H3> Duration and tie - breaking methods ( edit ) </H3> <P> A traditional game played under the rules of the Canadian Lacrosse Association consists of three periods of 20 minutes each ( similar to ice hockey ) , with the teams changing ends each period . The NLL plays four 15 - minute quarters rather than three periods . If the game is tied at the end of regulation play , a 5 - minute overtime ( 15 in NLL ) can be played . Overtime may or may not be sudden victory , depending on the league . </P> <H3> Ball in and out of play ( edit ) </H3> Referee placing the ball while opponents line up for a face - off . <P> Each period , and after each goal scored , play is restarted with a face - off . If a ball travels over the boards and outside of the playing area , play is restarted by possession being awarded to the opposing team to that which last touched the ball . </P> <P> During play , teams may substitute players in and out freely . Sometimes this is referred to as `` on the fly '' substitution . Substitution must occur within the designated exchange area in front of the players bench in order to be legal . The sport utilizes a shot clock and the attacking team must take a shot on goal within 30 seconds of gaining possession of the ball . In addition , players must advance the ball from their own defensive end to the offensive half of the floor within 10 seconds ( 8 in NLL ) . </P> <H3> Penalties ( edit ) </H3> <P> For most penalties , the offending player is sent to the penalty box and his team has to play without him and with one less player for a short amount of time . Most penalties last for two minutes unless a major penalty has been assessed . The team that has taken the penalty is said to be playing shorthanded while the other team is on the power play . </P> <P> A two - minute minor penalty is often called for lesser infractions such as slashing , tripping , elbowing , roughing , too many players , illegal equipment , holding , or interference . Five - minute major penalties are called for especially violent instances of most minor infractions that result in intentional injury to an opponent , as well as for fighting . Players are released from the penalty box when either the penalty time expires , or the opposition scores a goal ( or three goals for the instance of a major penalty ) . </P> <P> At the officials ' discretion a ten - minute misconduct penalty may be assessed . These are served in full by the penalized player , but his team may immediately substitute another player on the playing area unless a minor or major penalty is assessed in conjunction with the misconduct ( a `` two - and - ten '' or `` five - and - ten '' ) . In that case , the team designates another player to serve the minor or major ; both players go to the penalty box , but only the designee may not be replaced , and he is released upon the expiration of the two or five minutes . In addition , game misconducts are assessed for deliberate intent to inflict severe injury on an opponent . A player who receives a game misconduct is ejected and may not return to play . Receiving two major penalties in a game will result in a game misconduct . </P> A fight during a lacrosse game between two players on the Toronto Rock and Calgary Roughnecks <P> A penalty shot , where a player from the non-offending team is given an attempt to score a goal without opposition from any defending players except the goaltender , may be awarded under certain circumstances . By rule , teams must have at least three runners in play . If a team commits a third penalty resulting in a `` three man down '' situation a penalty shot is awarded in favor of having the offending player serve in the penalty box . A penalty shot may also be awarded , at the referee 's discretion , if a defensive player causes a foul to prevent a goal ( by throwing his stick , holding , tripping , or by deliberately displacing the goal , or a defensive player intentionally falls and covers a ball in his own team 's crease ) . In the NLL , a penalty shot is awarded against any team taking a too - many - men penalty in the final two minutes of the game or overtime . </P> Fighting ( edit ) <P> Similar to fighting in ice hockey , fighting is tolerated in professional box lacrosse . Professional players are not automatically subject to ejection , but incur a five - minute major penalty . In Canadian Lacrosse Association play , players are assessed a five - minute major penalty plus a game misconduct . Fighting in youth or club level box lacrosse is typically penalized with expulsion and suspensions . In 1990 , when the Six Nations created the new Mohawk lacrosse league , fighting was specifically targeted as unacceptable . Violators were ejected from the game in which the altercation occurred and given a minimum three game suspension . </P> <H2> International competition ( edit ) </H2> <P> Box lacrosse is the most popular version of the sport in the Czech Republic . It is also played to a marginal degree in Australia , primarily by players who have played field lacrosse . Club level box lacrosse leagues in the United States have increased the number of players exposed to the sport , including the : Baltimore Indoor Lacrosse League , the Philadelphia Box Lacrosse Association , and the Metro Area Box Lacrosse League . </P> <P> The first world championship of box lacrosse , `` The Nations in 1980 '' , was staged in several arenas in British Columbia , Canada in July 1980 involving teams representing the United States , Australia , Canada East , Canada West and the Iroquois Nationals . Canada West ( Coquitlam Adanacs ) defeated the Iroquois in the nationally televised world championship game from Pacific Coliseum in Vancouver . This was the first time in history that Indigenous peoples of the Americas people represented themselves in an athletic world championship competition . </P> <P> The second international box lacrosse tournament was held in 2003 , with the inaugural World Indoor Lacrosse Championships . The competitors were national teams from Australia , Canada , the Czech Republic , the Iroquois Nationals , Scotland , and the United States . </P> <P> The 2015 WILC was hosted by the Onondaga Nation which marks the first time an international sporting event has been held on indigenous land . 13 teams competed in the championship : Australia , Canada , Czech Republic , England , Finland , Germany , Iroquois Nationals , Ireland , Israel , Serbia , Switzerland , Turkey , and the United States . </P> <P> Canada , Iroquois Nationals and the United States have won gold , silver , and bronze respectively in each of the World Indoor Lacrosse Championships held . Canada has yet to lose an international game in box lacrosse . </P> <P> Other international tournaments have been played . Annually , the European Lacrosse Federation holds the Ale\u0161 H\u0159ebesk\u00fd Memorial tournament in Prague . This is the largest European box lacrosse tournament . In 2002 and 2004 , the Heritage Cup was played between the United States and Canada featuring mostly players that were members of NLL teams . </P> <H2> Women ( edit ) </H2> <P> Historically , box lacrosse has been exclusively a men 's sport . Women who played the sport of lacrosse typically played the women 's field lacrosse version . Recently , Ontario , Alberta , Nova Scotia and British Columbia have established girls ' and women 's box lacrosse leagues . </P> <P> During the 2003 NLL season , goaltender Ginny Capicchioni appeared in two preseason and one regular season games to become the only woman to make an appearance in the NLL . </P> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Canada portal </Li> <Li> Sports portal </Li> </Ul> <Ul> <Li> Lacrosse in Canada </Li> <Li> Sports in Canada </Li> <Li> Major Indoor Lacrosse League / National Lacrosse League ( 1997 -- present ) </Li> <Li> Major Series Lacrosse ( 1887 -- present ) </Li> <Li> Western Lacrosse Association ( 1932 -- present ) </Li> </Ul> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Footnotes ( edit ) </H3> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ Vennum , p. 9 </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Barrie , Don . `` Lacrosse on ice sounds nice '' .

It 's a rougher adaptation of the original field versions of lacrosse with elements similar to hockey and basketball . It has the speed , agility , flexibilty , coordination and main aspect of scoring on a net from hockey , the offensive set up ( 2 - 2 - 1 ) `` house '' when attacking the other team 's goal , a shot clock of 30 seconds to shoot on the net , and regular setting of `` picks '' similar to basketball . Box lacrosse defenders are allowed to block attackers from getting near their goal by cross checking , a technique that is not allowed in field lacrosse . Box Lacrosse is known to be the fastest sport on two feet and one of the most brutal sports known to man . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ `` REMOVED_SECRET. STILL UNDEFEATED . '' The Australasian .
