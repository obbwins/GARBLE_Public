Released on April 20 , 2018 , for the PlayStation 4 ( PS4 ) console , it is the eighth installment in the God of War series , the eighth chronologically , and the sequel to 2010 's God of War III . Unlike previous games , which were loosely based on Greek mythology , this game is loosely based on Norse mythology . The main protagonists are Kratos , the former Greek God of War , and his young son Atreus . Following the death of Kratos ' second wife and Atreus ' mother , they journey to fulfill her promise and spread her ashes at the highest peak of the nine realms . Kratos keeps his troubled past a secret from Atreus , who is unaware of his divine nature . Along their journey , they encounter monsters and gods of the Norse world . </P> <P> Described by creative director Cory Barlog as a reimagining of the franchise , a major gameplay change is that Kratos prominently uses a magical battle axe instead of his signature double - chained blades . God of War also uses an over-the - shoulder free camera , with the game in one shot , as opposed to the fixed cinematic camera of the previous entries . The game includes role - playing video game elements , and Kratos ' son Atreus provides assistance in combat . The majority of the original game 's development team worked on God of War and designed the game to be accessible and grounded . A separate short text - based game , God of War : A Call from the Wilds released in February 2018 , follows Atreus on his first adventure . </P> <P> God of War received universal acclaim from critics , being praised for its narrative , world design , art direction , graphics , characters , and combat system . It received perfect scores from multiple reviewers , making it the highest - rated game in the God of War series , as well the third highest - rated PS4 game , on Metacritic . The game performed well commercially , selling five million copies within a month of release . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Gameplay </Li> <Li> 2 Synopsis <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Setting </Li> <Li> 2.2 Characters </Li> <Li> 2.3 Plot </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Development <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Characterization </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Soundtrack </Li> <Li> 5 Release <Ul> <Li> 5.1 God of War : A Call from the Wilds </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 6 Reception <Ul> <Li> 6.1 Sales </Li> <Li> 6.2 Accolades </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 7 Notes </Li> <Li> 8 References </Li> <Li> 9 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Gameplay ( edit ) </H2> <P> The gameplay is vastly different from the previous installments , as it was rebuilt from the ground up . Although the previous main installment , Ascension ( 2013 ) , introduced multiplayer to the series , this installment is single - player - only . The game features a third - person , over-the - shoulder free camera , a departure from the previous installments , which featured a third - person , fixed cinematic camera ( with the exception of 2007 's 2D side - scroller Betrayal ) . Cinematographically , the game is presented in a continuous shot , with no camera cuts . The game is open , but it is not open - world . Due to it being open , players can fast travel to different locations through Mystic Gateways . As the ability to swim was cut from the game , players instead use a boat to traverse bodies of water . Just like previous entries , there are puzzles for players to solve to progress through parts of the game . Enemies in the game stem from Norse mythology , such as variants of trolls , ogres , dark elves and their king , wolves , wulvers , nightmares , draugrs , tatzelwurms , as well as Gullveig and the revenants , beings warped by sei\u00f0r magic , among other original creatures . Valkyries appear as optional boss battles , and players can free the dragons F\u00e1fnir , Otr , and Reginn -- dwarfs that were turned into dragons -- in addition to battling a dragon called Hr\u00e6zlyr . </P> <P> A major change is that Kratos no longer uses his signature double - chained blades , the Blades of Chaos , as his default weapon . Instead , he uses a magical battle axe , called the Leviathan Axe , which is infused with ice elemental magic . The axe can be thrown at enemies and magically summoned back to his hand ( similar to Thor 's hammer Mj\u00f6lnir ) . Larger enemies have precision targets and throwing the axe at those targets stuns the enemy . The weapon can also be thrown at environmental objects to trigger a damaging explosion and it can freeze objects and some enemies in place for puzzle solving until the axe is summoned back to Kratos ' hand . The axe has standard light and heavy attacks , and over time , it can be upgraded with runes to allow for special runic attacks , with one slot being for a light runic attack and the other for heavy . This provides players with a variety of options to cater to their own play style . For example , one of the light runic attacks allows Kratos to charge the axe and let out a burst of energy and one of the heavy runic attacks allows Kratos to summon a swirling ice storm . Another new weapon that Kratos utilizes is the Guardian Shield . When not in use , it folds up and appears like armor on Kratos ' left forearm . When summoned , the shield can be used offensively and defensively , similar to the Golden Fleece in previous games . Kratos also utilizes hand - to - hand combat , a feature originally introduced in Ascension . The Blades of Chaos are acquired late into the game via a plot device and perform similarly as they did in previous installments , but can also be upgraded with light and heavy runic attacks . </P> Pre-release gameplay screenshot of God of War , taken from the trailer shown at E3 2016 : Kratos ( center ) and his son Atreus ( right ) are battling a troll . Atreus can assist in combat , such as firing lightning arrows on the player 's command . <P> Similar to previous games , there is a `` Rage '' ability called Spartan Rage . Like the previous versions , the Rage ability has a meter that gradually fills during combat . With this ability , Kratos uses powerful bare - handed attacks , as opposed to weapons , to greatly damage enemies . The game also features elements similar to role - playing video games ( RPGs ) . There are crafting resources for the player to find that allow them to create new or upgrade existing armor with better perks . Players will also accumulate a currency called Hacksilver , a key component in crafting and purchasing new items . Experience points ( XP ) are used for learning new combat skills . Throughout the game world , players find chests containing random items , such as Hacksilver and enchantments for improving armor and weapons , as well as two special items , I\u00f0unn 's Apples and Horns of Blood Mead , which increase the maximum length of the health and rage meters , respectively . Quick time events have changed from previous games . Enemies display two meters above their heads , one for health and the other for stun . Filling up the stun meter helps to defeat more difficult enemies . When the stun meter is full , a grab - prompt will appear . Depending on the enemy , Kratos may rip it in half or grab them and throw them into other enemies , among other possible outcomes . </P> <P> Although the game is played entirely as Kratos , there are times when the player may choose to passively control Kratos ' son , Atreus . One button is dedicated to Atreus and its use depends on the context . For example , if the player needs assistance , they can look at an enemy , press the button , and Atreus will use his Talon Bow to shoot arrows at the enemy . The arrows have little effect on an enemy 's health , but do increase the stun meter . Over the course of the game , Atreus helps in combat , traversal , exploration , and puzzle - solving . When facing a large number of enemies , he distracts the weaker ones as Kratos fights the stronger ones . If too many enemies gang up on Atreus , he is knocked out for the remainder of that combat . Just like Kratos , Atreus acquires new skills , armor , special arrows , such as lightning arrows , as well as runic attacks for his Talon Bow , but it only has one slot instead of two . Atreus ' runic attacks summon different spectral animals with different abilities . For example , one summons a wolf that attacks enemies , while another summons the squirrel Ratatoskr that will dig up orbs to replenish Kratos ' health or rage meters . </P> <H2> Synopsis ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Setting ( edit ) </H3> <P> While the first seven games were loosely based on Greek mythology , this installment takes the series to Norse mythology , but predates the Vikings . Six of the nine realms of Norse mythology can be explored . The majority of the game takes place in the realm of Midgard , inhabited by humans and other creatures and is the same realm that the Greek world had existed in . As more creatures began appearing , many humans fled . Other realms visited as part of the story include Alfheim , the mystical home of the light and dark elves , Helheim , the icy land of the dead , and J\u00f6tunheim , the mountainous land of the giants . Other explorable realms include Niflheim , a realm of poisonous fog with a maze - like structure of rewards , and the fire realm Muspelheim , featuring the six Trials of Muspelheim ; completing each trial grants rewards and advances Kratos and Atreus closer to the top of a large volcano . Access to the other three realms -- Asgard , home of the \u00c6sir gods , Vanaheim , home of the Vanir gods , and Svartalfheim , home of the dwarves -- have been blocked by the ruler of Asgard and the \u00c6sir gods , Odin . At the center of the realms is the mythical tree Yggdrasil , which connects each realm together . Although each realm is a different world , they simultaneously exist in the same space . Travel to and from realms can be done by the use of the Bifr\u00f6st from a root of Yggdrasil contained within a temple located at the center of the Lake of the Nine . The temple was created by the now dead T\u00fdr , a peaceful God of War who had traveled to other lands and learned about their mythologies ; Odin had him killed as he believed T\u00fdr was secretly aiding the giants and would try to overthrow him . </P> <H3> Characters ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Characters of God of War <P> The protagonists of the game are Kratos ( voiced by Christopher Judge ) and his young son Atreus ( Sunny Suljic ) . Kratos is a warrior originally from Sparta who became the Greek God of War and is the son of Zeus . After ending up in Midgard , he met his second and now deceased wife , Laufey ( addressed as Faye ) , and they bore their son , Atreus , who does not know about Kratos ' past or his divine nature , but can hear other beings ' thoughts . The main antagonist is the \u00c6sir god Baldur ( Jeremy Davies ) , the brother of Thor , whose sons Modi and Magni ( Nolan North and Troy Baker , respectively ) assist Baldur . His parents are Odin and the Vanir god Freya ( Danielle Bisutti ) . Freya tried leaving Odin , as she did not truly love him , and Odin had her banished to Midgard , after which she became known as the Witch of the Woods . To protect her son from a prophecy that foretold his death , Freya cast a spell of immortality on Baldur , which also caused him to not feel pain or any feeling of pleasure , which he resented her for . The only thing that she could not prevent from breaking the spell was mistletoe , which she kept secret . Other characters include M\u00edmir ( Alastair Duncan ) , who claims to be the smartest man alive , and the Huldra Brothers Brok ( Roger Craighead ) and Sindri ( Adam J. Harrington ) , a pair of dwarves who appear at various points in the world and assist Kratos and Atreus with forging new gear . Their weapons , including Thor 's hammer Mj\u00f6lnir , were used by the \u00c6sir gods and they also had forged Kratos ' Leviathan Axe , which originally belonged to Faye , who also gifted Kratos his Guardian Shield . The spirit of the Greek goddess Athena ( Carole Ruggier ) makes a cameo appearance , and Zeus ( Corey Burton ) appears as an illusion to Kratos in Helheim . </P> <H3> Plot ( edit ) </H3> <P> Many years have passed since Kratos took his vengeance against the Olympian gods , and he now lives with his young son Atreus in Midgard . The game opens following the death of Kratos ' second wife and Atreus ' mother , Faye , whose last wish was for her ashes to be spread at the highest peak of the nine realms . Before beginning their journey , Kratos is confronted by a mysterious man with godlike powers . After seemingly killing him , Kratos and Atreus set out on their journey . </P> <P> Reaching the Lake of the Nine , Kratos and Atreus encounter the friendly World Serpent , J\u00f6rmungandr . After running into impenetrable black mist which can only be extinguished with the Light of Alfheim , they receive aid from the Witch of the Woods to use the Bifr\u00f6st in order to travel to Alfheim and secure the Light . Upon vanquishing the mist and reaching Midgard 's peak , they overhear a conversation between the mysterious man , revealed to be Baldur , his nephews Modi and Magni , and the imprisoned M\u00edmir . After they leave , Kratos and Atreus confront M\u00edmir , who reveals that their goal is actually in J\u00f6tunheim , but travel there has been blocked to keep out Odin and Thor . M\u00edmir , however , knows another passage . He instructs Kratos to cut off his head and have it revived by the Witch of the Woods , revealed to be Freya . Kratos immediately distrusts her , but both Freya and M\u00edmir warn him that he must tell Atreus about his true nature . </P> <P> Kratos , Atreus , and M\u00edmir 's head journey to collect needed components to open J\u00f6tunheim 's portal when they are attacked by Modi and Magni . After Kratos kills Magni , Modi flees , but later returns and ambushes them . Atreus collapses ill , which M\u00edmir and Freya explain is a mental contradiction of a god believing himself to be mortal . She tells Kratos that he must retrieve the heart of the Keeper of the Bridge of the Damned in Helheim , but his Leviathan Axe is useless there . Kratos then returns home to unearth his old weapons , the Blades of Chaos , and is haunted by Athena 's spirit , who goads him about his past . After retrieving the heart , he has a haunting vision of Zeus . Atreus is cured and Kratos tells him that he is a god . Atreus then becomes increasingly arrogant on their journey , and he murders a weakened Modi , despite Kratos ordering not to . At Midgard 's peak , they are ambushed by Baldur , resulting in J\u00f6tunheim 's portal being destroyed and the group falling into Helheim . </P> <P> Atreus makes amends with Kratos and they find out about Freya and Baldur 's familial relationship . Returning to Midgard , M\u00edmir realizes there is another way to reach J\u00f6tunheim , but it requires recovering his missing eye . After obtaining it from J\u00f6rmungandr 's belly , who had inadvertently swallowed it when he ate a statue of Thor , they are attacked by Baldur again , but Freya intervenes in an attempt to protect her son . During the fight , Baldur is pierced by Atreus ' mistletoe arrow , breaking Freya 's spell on him . Baldur is defeated , and although Kratos gives him an opportunity to retreat , he instead attempts to strangle Freya , forcing Kratos to kill him . A grieving Freya swears revenge on Kratos and taunts him about hiding his true nature from Atreus . Kratos finally tells Atreus about his past and how he had killed his fellow Greek gods , including his father , Zeus . Atreus laments if patricide is all that gods are good for . Kratos tells Atreus that they should both learn from their experiences and not repeat the mistakes of their predecessors . A silent Freya leaves with Baldur 's corpse and M\u00edmir hopefully suggests that she will eventually move on from the tragedy and that Kratos did the right thing . </P> <P> In J\u00f6tunheim , they find a temple with a mural depicting their adventures , showing that the giants had foreseen everything that would happen and vaguely foretold what was to come . In addition , they discover that Faye was a giant who decided to stay behind in Midgard , making Atreus part giant , part god , and part mortal . Their fight with Baldur was shown , revealing he was actually after Faye the whole time . It is also revealed that Atreus was named Loki by his mother . Wondering if Faye planned this in advance , Kratos and Atreus fulfill their promise and spread her ashes at the peak . Afterwards , Kratos reveals to Atreus that his given name was also the name of a compassionate Spartan comrade . When they return to Midgard , M\u00edmir warns them that the three - year long Fimbulwinter has started , meaning Ragnar\u00f6k is soon to follow , which was not supposed to occur for another hundred years . </P> <P> In the game 's secret ending , Kratos and Atreus return home and slumber . Atreus has a vision that at the end of Fimbulwinter , Thor will arrive at their home to confront them . </P> <H2> Development ( edit ) </H2> <P> At the first annual PlayStation Experience on December 6 , 2014 , Santa Monica Studios 's creative director Cory Barlog confirmed that a new God of War was in very early development . He said that the game would not be a prequel , but it might be a reboot . In April 2016 , Polygon reported that concept art of the next installment had been leaked . The images showed Kratos in the world of Norse mythology ; a concept originally considered by series creator David Jaffe after Kratos eliminated the Greek gods . At the 2016 Electronic Entertainment Expo ( E3 ) , the next installment was officially announced with a gameplay demo and confirmed the concept art to be true . The demo showed a fully bearded Kratos with a son , and Kratos was teaching the boy how to hunt . The pair also battled a troll . The end of the demo showed the title God of War and confirmed it was in development for the PlayStation 4 . E3 also confirmed that Barlog had returned to the series as game director for the new installment . Barlog has been a major contributor in the development of the God of War series since the original installment in 2005 , with his prior most notable role being game director of God of War II ( 2007 ) . This new installment was his fifth God of War game . </P> <P> In naming the game , Barlog stated that it was deliberately titled God of War with no numeral or subtitle because although it is a continuation of the series , `` we are reimagining everything . '' Head of Santa Monica Studio Shannon Studstill and Barlog said that Sony Interactive Entertainment had to be convinced to do another God of War game as a lot of people at Sony wanted the series to `` sleep and rest '' due to the lackluster response of the previous game , Ascension . In explaining why Barlog was brought back , Studstill said that he knew the series very well , `` and bringing in someone that understands that history is the respect the franchise deserves . '' Barlog followed up and said that `` You got ta know the rules to break the rules . '' Series creator David Jaffe was also considered , but was unavailable . </P> <P> In explaining the transition from Greek mythology to Norse mythology , Barlog said : `` it 's kind of this BC -- AD change over kind of thing . We 're moving and starting from zero and kind of moving forward on that . '' Before settling on Norse mythology , Egyptian mythology was also considered . Barlog said that half of the team was for it , but since `` there 's a lot more about civilization - it 's less isolated , less barren '' , he had to make the decision and decided on the Norse setting because they wanted the focus to stay on Kratos : `` Having too much around distracts from that central theme of a stranger in a strange land . '' In explaining why Kratos was now in the Norse world , Barlog said that different cultures ' belief systems coexisted , but they were `` separated by geography '' , suggesting that Kratos traveled from Greece to Norway ( Scandinavia ) after the conclusion of God of War III ; in clarifying the conclusion of that game , Barlog said that Kratos did not destroy what was believed to be the entire world , but only the portion that was ruled over by the Greeks . Barlog said that the new game predates the Vikings ; it is the time in which their gods walked the Earth . It was also confirmed that this would not be Kratos ' last game . Barlog said that future games could see the series tackling Egyptian or Mayan mythology , and that although this game focuses on Norse mythology , it alludes to the fact that there are other mythologies co-existing in the world . Barlog also said that he liked the idea of having different directors for each game , seen throughout the first seven games , and although he may not direct another God of War , he would still be at Santa Monica to work on future games . </P> <P> Most of the development team that worked on the original God of War worked on the new installment . They claimed that they matched the new gameplay with the same level of accessibility as the previous installments . It was confirmed that the game would not feature any morality system or branching story ; all players have the same story experience . The developers also confirmed that some of the more controversial mini-games found in previous entries ( such as the sex mini-game ) would not return . Some gameplay characteristics found in the previous installments were cut , such as jumping , swimming , and instant - death platforming challenges ; these were cut due to the camera being closer to Kratos . Although the previous installment , Ascension , introduced multiplayer to the series , the team decided to drop the mode to focus on the single - player experience . In changing the gameplay , Studstill said `` I felt like , in order to reinvent , we really needed to turn a lot of things around . '' In regards to the camera change , Barlog said `` We wanted a much more intimate experience , a much more up close , and a much more player - controlled experience , so the camera really is a mechanic that ( we leaned ) into heavily for everything in the game . '' Explaining Kratos ' axe , lead gameplay designer Jason McDonald , who has worked on the series since the original game , said the axe was chosen because they wanted a more grounded direction for the game . Initially , they were unsure how to make it unique , like how the double - chained blades were . After they came up with the concept of throwing the axe and having it return to Kratos , `` things started to fall into place . '' McDonald said that combat with the axe is a little slower than what it was with the blades , `` but it 's just as fluid and just as brutal as it 's ever been . '' Barlog took inspiration from Dark Souls ( 2011 ) , which influenced the game 's combat system , particularly its gameplay loop and strategic decision - making , as well as the game 's approach to storytelling . In addition , designers Anthony Dimento and Luis Sanchez revealed how God of War 's level design and exploration was influenced by Bloodborne ( 2015 ) , as they wanted to `` just have the world breathe a little bit '' and expand upon player discovery by including `` micro-loops where you 're unlocking paths , unlocking shortcuts ... '' that gave purpose . </P> <P> The entire game was done in a single shot , as in no camera cuts , meaning there are no loading screens or fade - to - black between gameplay and cutscenes . The frame rate was confirmed as 30 frames per second , and the enemy count was increased to up to 100 enemies on - screen ; God of War III and Ascension could do up to 50 . Unlike the previous games , Santa Monica did not make a demo specifically for public release . Barlog explained that doing so would have delayed the game by a couple of months . He also confirmed that the game was built for the standard PlayStation 4 , but the game would `` benefit from the power '' of the PlayStation 4 Pro ; an updated version of the PlayStation 4 that can render games in 4K and was released a few months after God of War was announced . In late December 2016 , Barlog confirmed that the game was playable from start to finish . At the 2017 PlayStation Experience , Barlog said that the game 's story would take 25 - 35 hours to complete , which is significantly more than the previous four main installments , which each took an average of 10 hours to complete . </P> <P> At E3 2017 , a new trailer was shown featuring new gameplay , cinematics , and characters . In the trailer , Kratos was shown using a shield that he could use offensively and defensively . At one point in the trailer , Kratos finds a Greek vase with himself on it , wielding his infamous double - chained blades . During the trailer , an unnamed woman warns Kratos about the Norse gods , as they know what he did to the Greek gods , while a pair of wolves were also shown . The trailer ends with Kratos and Atreus encountering the World Serpent . Atreus was able to translate what it said , which was that it wanted to help the pair . It was confirmed that the game would release in early 2018 . Since E3 2017 until the game 's launch , Santa Monica included a section on the God of War website titled `` The Lost Pages '' , detailing some of the lore of God of War 's Nordic world . In January 2018 , the game 's release date was confirmed for April 20 , 2018 . A trailer was also released that showed that the character M\u00edmir from the mythology would have a role in the game . On March 22 , God of War went gold . </P> <H3> Characterization ( edit ) </H3> Christopher Judge does the voice and cinematic motion capture for Kratos in the game , replacing longstanding voice actor Terrence C. Carson , who had voiced Kratos since the original 2005 game , and also did the motion capture for him in 2013 's Ascension <P> During early development , there was talk about having a different protagonist for the game , but it was decided to keep Kratos . Referencing the Nintendo character Mario and the Mario games , Barlog said that just like Mario , `` Kratos is intrinsically tied '' to the God of War series . In regards to the new changes , Barlog said that : </P> <P> I knew I did n't want to simply reboot the franchise , starting over with a retelling of the origin story . I wanted to reimagine the gameplay , give players a fresh perspective and a new tactile experience while delving deeper into the emotional journey of Kratos to explore the compelling drama that unfolds when an immortal demigod makes a decision to change . </P> <P> Barlog explained that Kratos had to change his cycle of violence and learn how to control his rage . He said that Kratos had made many bad decisions , which led to the destruction of Olympus , and wanted to know what would happen if Kratos made a good decision . The birth of Barlog 's own son influenced the idea of Kratos ' character change . The canceled live - action Star Wars television series was also an influence . The bond between Kratos and his son is at the heart of the game and Barlog said `` This game is about Kratos teaching his son how to be a god , and his son teaching Kratos how to be human again . '' Referencing the Marvel Comics character Hulk , Barlog said that in regards to Kratos , `` We 've already told the story of The Hulk . We want to tell the story of ( Bruce ) Banner now . '' One of their goals was to make Kratos `` a more nuanced and interesting character . '' In changing the narrative focus , Studstill said `` I think we inherently knew the franchise needed to evolve in that emotional beat and be something meatier for the older generation of gamers . '' </P> <P> Christopher Judge , best known as Teal'c from Stargate SG - 1 , replaced T.C. Carson as the voice of Kratos ; Carson had voiced Kratos since the original God of War . Commenting in response to the change , Carson said , `` Sony went in a new direction . '' Barlog explained that the way the previous games were made , they were able to have someone else do the motion capture instead of the voice actor . Although Carson had done the motion capture for Kratos in Ascension , Barlog said the actor change was made because of the type of camera work they wanted to do . For the new camera work , they needed someone who was closer to Kratos ' size to do the motion capture along with a child . Carson was unsuitable for this because he was much shorter than Kratos , who is over 6 - feet tall : `` Offsetting ( Carson 's height ) for the size of a child , it turned out it was going to be almost impossible to try and actually shoot them and go in and redo the animations . '' Judge was chosen because he was 6 - foot - 3 and had the body of a professional football player . He was also chosen because of the chemistry with his then - 10 - year - old co-star , Sunny Suljic , who plays Kratos ' son Atreus ; Suljic 's opinion was also sought in making the decision , and out of all the auditions , he liked Judge the most . The two bonded well , and Judge described his time with Suljic as time he had missed with his own children . In stepping into the role of Kratos , Judge took it as an opportunity to add something new to the character . He researched the character and Carson 's performance , but decided not to imitate it . Since Santa Monica were going in a new direction , he decided to start fresh and go from there . Judge was thrown off when he first read the script , stating it `` was a real script '' , and not just `` a way to get into battles . '' He said `` it was really this great story of this relationship and this crazy mythology . '' While Judge did all of Kratos ' motion capture for the cinematic scenes , stuntman Eric Jacobus did all of Kratos ' combat motion capture ; Jacobus was found by God of War 's animators on YouTube . Instead of going directly to Santa Monica to audition , Jacobus recorded an audition tape and they immediately hired him . </P> <P> During E3 2016 , GameSpot mistakenly reported that Kratos ' son 's name was Charlie , which Barlog laughingly denied . In January 2017 , after a fan downloaded the God of War overture and saw the track 's details that said `` An introduction to Kratos and Atreus '' , Barlog confirmed on Twitter that Atreus was in fact the son 's name . Barlog said that Atreus was unaware that Kratos was a demigod , and did not know about his past . They did not reveal details of Atreus ' mother prior to release due to her being a critical part of the story . Barlog stated that during gameplay , Atreus would be `` like magic , an additional combat resource , and ( the player is ) training him and teaching him . '' The developers stated that Atreus would not be a burden during gameplay . The team experimented with several different approaches for Atreus to ensure that he was an empowering presence . Barlog said he did not want the game to be an escort - mission where the A.I. caused a problem for the player . Their goal was for Atreus to enhance Kratos ' capabilities without Atreus becoming a liability . This resulted in the developers designating a command button for Atreus as well as for him to act freely . During combat , Atreus was also designed to call out enemy locations , as due to the camera being closer to Kratos , some enemies may be difficult for the player to see . Jason McDonald said it took a lot of iterations with the enemies and Atreus to make it all work together . </P> <P> Early in development , it was suggested for Atreus to be cut or to significantly minimize his role due to the many developmental challenges and financial expense . Barlog stated that the game could have worked without Atreus , but it would have been completely different , likening it to that of the 2013 film All Is Lost . Barlog said that with just Kratos , it would have been `` one character who talks to himself occasionally , but generally , it will be very silent and everyone will talk in old Norse , so that you wo n't understand anything anybody 's saying . '' After hearing Barlog 's case , Sony gave him the freedom to incorporate Atreus . Lead level designer Rob Davis also noted that with Atreus , it allowed for `` significant gameplay and storytelling opportunities that might not otherwise ( been ) possible . '' </P> <H2> Soundtrack ( edit ) </H2> <P> Bear McCreary , best known for his work on television shows such as Battlestar Galactica and The Walking Dead , scored God of War and composed themes for the game . McCreary said that he was called into Santa Monica Studio in November 2014 to meet with music producers Peter Scaturro and Keith Leary to discuss `` a secret project '' ; McCreary had previously collaborated with Scaturro and Leary on 2011 's SOCOM 4 : U.S. Navy SEALs . Ideas of folk music , mythology , Nordic ethnic instruments , vocal writing , and classical thematic development were discussed , to which McCreary correctly guessed that the discussions were about a new God of War . He met with Barlog early on , and they discussed Barlog 's narrative vision for the game . After meeting with Barlog , he felt that the franchise was in good hands because God of War II , which Barlog also directed , was his favorite installment . </P> <P> McCreary 's initial efforts focused on writing the new main theme , or what he called the Kratos Theme . He spent several months working with Barlog , Scaturro , Leary , Sony music director Chuck Doud , and the rest of the development team in making this new theme . McCreary described the Kratos Theme as `` arguably one of my most structurally satisfying and catchy melodies . '' The main theme features low orchestral instruments , Icelandic choir , deep male vocals , powerful female vocals ( in particular Faroese singer Eiv\u00f8r P\u00e1lsd\u00f3ttir ) , folk percussion , and Nordic stringed instruments , such as the nyckelharpa and hurdy gurdy . When it was decided that God of War would be revealed at E3 2016 , Sony wanted McCreary to perform his original score with a live orchestra at the press conference . McCreary opened the show with the new main theme before the unveiling of God of War , and performed the gameplay demo 's music live during the presentation . On January 13 , 2017 , a live recording from E3 2016 of God of War 's overture was released for free for a limited time . Barlog released the overture as a thank you to fans for God of War 's E3 2016 trailer reaching fifteen million views on YouTube . </P> <H2> Release ( edit ) </H2> <P> The game was released worldwide on April 20 , 2018 , for the PlayStation 4 . In addition to the standard base game , there were three special editions : the Stone Mason Edition , the Collector 's Edition , and the Digital Deluxe Edition . Only available in the United States and Canada , the Stone Mason Edition came with several physical items , including the base game in a SteelBook case , a 9 - inch ( 230 mm ) statue of Kratos and Atreus that was created by Gentle Giant , 2 - inch ( 51 mm ) carvings of the Huldra Brothers , a horse , and a troll , an exclusive lithograph , a cloth map , a stone mason 's ring , and a keychain of M\u00edmir 's head that talks . There was also various downloadable content ( DLC ) , including an exclusive shield skin , in addition to an armor set and another shield skin for Kratos , a PlayStation 4 dynamic theme , a digital artbook , and God of War # 0 by Dark Horse Comics . The Collector 's Edition came with many of the same items , minus the ring , the keychain , the 2 - inch ( 51 mm ) carvings of the horse and troll , and the exclusive shield skin . The Digital Deluxe Edition comes with all of the digital content , minus the exclusive shield skin . U.S. and Canadian customers also received a Kratos and Atreus pin for pre-ordering the Digital Deluxe Edition . Pre-orders at select retailers received three skins for Kratos ' shield , while pre-orders from GameStop or EB Games also received a `` Luck of Ages XP Talisman '' , granting increased XP gain , increased Hacksilver gain , and increased ability to trigger perks . </P> <P> In addition to the special editions of the game , a Limited Edition PlayStation 4 Pro bundle was also available the same day as the game 's release . The bundle included the standard base game , a PlayStation 4 Pro console decorated with the runes as on Kratos ' axe , and a similarly themed DualShock 4 controller with the God of War logo . Game Director Cory Barlog confirmed that God of War would not have microtransactions post-launch , a feature that has become prominent with other recent games and negatively criticized . Since launch , Santa Monica has supported the game via patch updates to address software bugs . Additionally , the developers added a Photo Mode in update patch 1.20 , released on May 9 , 2018 . Photo Mode allows players to take customized in - game screenshots . Players can adjust the field of view , depth of view , filters , borders , the visibility of characters , and the ability to change the facial expressions of Kratos and Atreus . </P> <H3> God of War : a Call from the Wilds ( edit ) </H3> <P> God of War : A Call from the Wilds is a text - based game playable through Facebook Messenger . To help further promote God of War , Sony partnered with Facebook to develop the play - by - web game , which released on February 1 , 2018 . Completing the game unlocks downloadable concept art . The short story follows Atreus on his first adventure in the Norse wilds . After archery training and learning runes with his mother , Atreus adventures into the wilderness after telepathically hearing the voice of a dying deer ; he finds it covered in blood and stays with it during its final moments . A couple of draugrs appear and Atreus attempts to fight them , but is injured . He is saved by his father , Kratos , who was out hunting . The two then battle a revenant before returning home . </P> <H2> Reception ( edit ) </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Reception </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> <Table> <Tr> <Th_colspan=\"2\"> Aggregate score </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Aggregator </Th> <Th> Score </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Metacritic </Td> <Td> 94 / 100 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th_colspan=\"2\"> Review scores </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Publication </Th> <Th> Score </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Destructoid </Td> <Td> 10 / 10 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> EGM </Td> <Td> 9.5 / 10 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Game Informer </Td> <Td> 9.75 / 10 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Game Revolution </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> GameSpot </Td> <Td> 9 / 10 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> GamesRadar+ </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Giant Bomb </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> IGN </Td> <Td> 10 / 10 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Polygon </Td> <Td> 10 / 10 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> The Guardian </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> USgamer </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> </Table> </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> God of War received `` universal acclaim '' according to review aggregator Metacritic , tying it with the original God of War for the highest score in the franchise .
