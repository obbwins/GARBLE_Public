From sources originating in the Armenian Highlands of eastern Turkey they flow by / through Syria through Iraq into the Persian Gulf . The system is part of the Palearctic Tigris -- Euphrates ecoregion , which includes Iraq and parts of Turkey , Syria , Iran , Saudi Arabia , Kuwait , and Jordan . </P> <P> From their sources and upper courses in the mountains of eastern Anatolia , the rivers descend through valleys and gorges to the uplands of Syria and northern Iraq and then to the alluvial plain of central Iraq . The rivers flow in a south - easterly direction through the central plain and combine at Al - Qurnah to form the Shatt al - Arab and discharge into the Persian Gulf . </P> <P> The region has historical importance as part of the Fertile Crescent region , in which civilization is believed to have first emerged . </P> <H2> Contents </H2> <Ul> <Li> 1 Geography </Li> <Li> 2 General description </Li> <Li> 3 Ecological threats </Li> <Li> 4 Water dispute </Li> <Li> 5 Conservation </Li> <Li> 6 In media </Li> <Li> 7 See also </Li> <Li> 8 References </Li> <Li> 9 External links </Li> </Ul> <H2> Geography ( edit ) </H2> <P> The ecoregion is characterized by two large rivers , the Tigris and Euphrates . The rivers have several small tributaries which feed into the system from shallow freshwater lakes , swamps , and marshes , all surrounded by desert . The hydrology of these vast marshes is extremely important to the ecology of the entire upper Persian Gulf . Historically , the area is known as Mesopotamia . As part of the larger Fertile Crescent , it saw the earliest emergence of literate urban civilization in the Uruk period , for which reason it is often described as a `` Cradle of Civilization '' . </P> <P> In the 1980s , this ecoregion was put in grave danger as the Iran -- Iraq War raged within its boundaries . The wetlands of Iraq , which were inhabited by the Marsh Arabs , were almost completely dried out , and have only recently shown signs of recovery . </P> <P> The Tigris -- Euphrates Basin is shared by Turkey , Syria , Iraq , Iran and Kuwait . Many Tigris tributaries originate in Iran and a Tigris -- Euphrates confluence forms part of the Kuwait -- Iraq border . Since the 1960s and in the 1970s , when Turkey began the GAP project in earnest , water disputes have regularly occurred in addition to the associated dam 's effects on the environment . In addition , Syrian and Iranian dam construction has also contributed to political tension within the basin , particularly during drought . </P> <H2> General description ( edit ) </H2> Marsh Arabs poling a mashoof in the marshes of southern Iraq <P> The general climate of the region is subtropical , hot and arid . At the northern end of the Persian Gulf is the vast floodplain of the Euphrates , Tigris , and Karun Rivers , featuring huge permanent lakes , marshes , and forest . The aquatic vegetation includes reeds , rushes , and papyrus , which support numerous species . Areas around the Tigris and the Euphrates are very fertile . Marshy land is home to water birds , some stopping here while migrating , and some spending the winter in these marshes living off the lizards , snakes , frogs , and fish . Other animals found in these marshes are water buffalo , two endemic rodent species , antelopes and gazelles and small animals such as the jerboa and several other mammals . </P> <H2> Ecological threats ( edit ) </H2> Play media This visualization shows variations in total water storage from normal , in millimeters , in the Tigris and Euphrates river basins , from January 2003 through December 2009 . Reds represent drier conditions , while blues represent wetter conditions . The effects of the seasons are evident , as is the major drought that hit the region in 2007 . The majority of the water lost was due to reductions in groundwater caused by human activities . <P> Iraq suffers from desertification and soil salination due in large part to thousands of years of agricultural activity . Water and plant life are sparse . Saddam Hussein 's government water - control projects drained the inhabited marsh areas east of An Nasiriyah by drying up or diverting streams and rivers . Shi'a Muslims were displaced under the Ba'athist regime . The destruction of the natural habitat poses serious threats to the area 's wildlife populations . There are also inadequate supplies of potable water . </P> <P> The marshlands were an extensive natural wetlands ecosystem which developed over thousands of years in the Tigris -- Euphrates basin and once covered 15 -- 20,000 square kilometers . According to the United Nations Environmental Program and the AMAR Charitable Foundation , between 84 % and 90 % of the marshes have been destroyed since the 1970s . In 1994 , 60 percent of the wetlands were destroyed by Hussein 's regime -- drained to permit military access and greater political control of the native Marsh Arabs . Canals , dykes and dams were built routing the water of the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers around the marshes , instead of allowing water to move slowly through the marshland . After part of the Euphrates was dried up due to re-routing its water to the sea , a dam was built so water could not back up from the Tigris and sustain the former marshland . Some marshlands were burned and pipes buried underground helped to carry away water for quicker drying . </P> <P> The drying of the marshes led to the disappearance of the salt - tolerant vegetation ; the plankton rich waters that fertilized surrounding soils ; 52 native fish species ; the wild boar , red fox , buffalo and water birds of the marsh habitat . </P> <H2> Water dispute ( edit ) </H2> <P> The issue of water rights became a point of contention for Iraq , Turkey and Syria beginning in the 1960s when Turkey implemented a public - works project ( the GAP project ) aimed at harvesting the water from the Tigris and Euphrates rivers through the construction of 22 dams , for irrigation and hydroelectric energy purposes . Although the water dispute between Turkey and Syria was more problematic , the GAP project was also perceived as a threat by Iraq . The tension between Turkey and Iraq about the issue was increased by the effect of Syria and Turkey 's participation in the UN embargo against Iraq following the Gulf War . However , the issue had never become as significant as the water dispute between Turkey and Syria . </P> <P> The 2008 drought in Iraq sparked new negotiations between Iraq and Turkey over trans - boundary river flows . Although the drought affected Turkey , Syria and Iran as well , Iraq complained regularly about reduced water flows . Iraq particularly complained about the Euphrates River because of the large amount of dams on the river . Turkey agreed to increase the flow several times , beyond its means in order to supply Iraq with extra water . Iraq has seen significant declines in water storage and crop yields because of the drought . To make matters worse , Iraq 's water infrastructure has suffered from years of conflict and neglect . </P> <P> In 2008 , Turkey , Iraq and Syria agreed to restart the Joint Trilateral Committee on water for the three nations for better water resources management . Turkey , Iraq and Syria signed a memorandum of understanding on September 3 , 2009 , in order to strengthen communication within the Tigris -- Euphrates Basin and to develop joint water - flow - monitoring stations . On September 19 , 2009 , Turkey formally agreed to increase the flow of the Euphrates River to 450 to 500 m3 / s , but only until October 20 , 2009 . In exchange , Iraq agreed to trade petroleum with Turkey and help curb Kurdish militant activity in their border region . One of Turkey 's last large GAP dams on the Tigris -- the Ilisu Dam -- is strongly opposed by Iraq and is the source of political strife . </P> <H2> Conservation ( edit ) </H2> <P> The Mesopotamian Marshes in southern Iraq were historically the largest wetland ecosystem of Western Eurasia . Their drainage began in the 1950s , to reclaim land for agriculture and oil exploration . Saddam Hussein extended this work in the late 1980s and early 1990s , as part of ecological warfare against the Marsh Arabs , a rebellious group of people in Baathist Iraq . However , with the breaching of the dikes by local communities after the 2003 invasion of Iraq and the ending of a four - year drought that same year , the process has been reversed and the marshes have experienced a substantial rate of recovery . The permanent wetlands now cover more than 50 % of pre-1970s levels , with a remarkable regrowth of the Hammar and Hawizeh Marshes and some recovery of the Central Marshes . </P> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> This table is in a list format that may be better presented using prose .
