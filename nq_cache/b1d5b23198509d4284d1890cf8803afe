{"document_text": "Black Dirt region - wikipedia <H1> Black Dirt region </H1> Jump to : navigation , search Black dirt field near the village of Florida <P> The Black Dirt Region is located in southern Orange County , New York , United States and northern Sussex County , New Jersey . It is mostly located in the western section of the Town of Warwick , centered on the hamlet of Pine Island . Some sections spill over into adjacent portions of the towns of Chester , Goshen and Wawayanda in New York and parts of Wantage and Vernon , New Jersey . Before the region was drained in the early nineteenth century through drainage culverts and the construction of the Delaware and Hudson Canal , it was a densely - vegetated marsh known as the `` Drowned Lands of the Wallkill '' </P> <P> The Black Dirt Region takes its name from the dark , extremely fertile soil left over from an ancient glacial lake bottom augmented by decades of past flooding of the Wallkill River . The 26,000 acres ( 10,400 ha ) of muck left over is the largest concentration of such soil in the United States outside the Florida Everglades . </P> The Black Dirt Region , viewed looking south from a hill in the Town of Goshen . <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Geography </Li> <Li> 2 History </Li> <Li> 3 See also </Li> <Li> 4 References </Li> <Li> 5 Further reading </Li> <Li> 6 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Geography ( edit ) </H2> <P> The area mostly consists of flat flood plain . The few areas that rise above the valley floor are known as `` islands '' , since they often were in times of heavy flooding . New Jersey 's Pochuck Mountain looms just to the south of the region , and the ridge continues into the region as a small upland area called Pochuck Neck ; there are two smaller hills within it known as Mounts Adam and Eve , rising to 900 and 1,060 feet ( 274 and 323 m ) respectively . The area is also very noticeable on satellite imagery by the color differential from its surroundings . </P> <H2> History ( edit ) </H2> <P> Farmers generally avoided the area in the early years of settlement , because the soil , although rich , was frequently flooded and poorly drained . Instead , the land was used for pasturage , though sudden storms would often drown the stock . Starting in 1804 , talks began about the best way to drain the swampland . First , an attempt was made to clear the natural obstacles , but that proved too expensive . Instead , a drainage canal was constructed by General George D. Wickham through his property in 1835 . ( The former course is now a creek meandering parallel ) . Immigrants from Eastern Europe , particularly Poles and Volga Germans , had worked similar soils , known as `` chernozem '' , in their native countries and began farming the former swampland . In the mid-19th century they won a series of conflicts with downstream millers later dubbed `` the Muskrat and Beaver Wars '' , giving them the right to prevent a dam from being built on the drainage channel </P> <P> They eventually began growing the pungent , highly prized black - dirt onion on the land , taking advantage of the relative proximity of New York City as a market . By the late 20th century the region was producing an average of 30,000 pounds of onion per acre . Today , due to changing popular tastes in onions and different economic realities , that staple is not as profitable as it was , and farmers in the region have been diversifying their crops to include lettuce , radish , potatoes , tomatoes , carrots , and , increasingly , sod . Development of the farmland is considered unlikely since the soil is very poor for building . </P> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Hudson Valley portal </Li> </Ul> <Ul> <Li> Terra preta </Li> <Li> Vincent Kosuga </Li> </Ul> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> ^ Jump up to : Gordon , John Steele ( December 1990 ) . `` Sowing the American Dream '' .
