It is an adaptation of the 1964 novel Charlie and the Chocolate Factory by Roald Dahl . Dahl was credited with writing the film 's screenplay ; however , David Seltzer , who went uncredited in the film , was brought in to re-work Dahl 's screenplay against his wishes , making major changes to the ending and adding musical numbers . These changes and other decisions made by the director led Dahl to disown the film . </P> <P> The film tells the story of Charlie Bucket ( Peter Ostrum ) as he receives a Golden Ticket and visits Willy Wonka 's chocolate factory with four other children from around the world . Filming took place in Munich in 1970 , and the film was released by Paramount Pictures on June 30 , 1971 . With a budget of just $3 million , the film received generally positive reviews and earned $4 million by the end of its original run . Paramount distributed the film until 1977 , and beginning in the 1980s , Warner Bros. assumed control of the rights for home entertainment purposes . The film then made an additional $21 million during its re-release by Warner Bros. under its Family Entertainment banner in 1996 . The film became highly popular in part through repeated television airings and home entertainment sales . In 1972 , the film received an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Score , and Wilder was nominated for a Golden Globe as Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy , but lost both to Fiddler on the Roof . The film also introduced the song `` The Candy Man '' , which went on to become a popular hit when recorded by Sammy Davis Jr . In 2014 , the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being `` culturally , historically , or aesthetically significant '' . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Plot </Li> <Li> 2 Main cast <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Oompa Loompas </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Production <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Development </Li> <Li> 3.2 Casting </Li> <Li> 3.3 Filming </Li> <Li> 3.4 Promotion </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Reception <Ul> <Li> 4.1 Dahl 's reaction </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 5 Television </Li> <Li> 6 Adaptation </Li> <Li> 7 Home media </Li> <Li> 8 Music </Li> <Li> 9 Soundtrack </Li> <Li> 10 See also </Li> <Li> 11 Notes </Li> <Li> 12 References </Li> <Li> 13 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Plot ( edit ) </H2> <P> In an unnamed town , children visit a candy shop . Charlie Bucket , a poor paperboy , stares through the window as the shop owner sings `` The Candy Man '' . Walking home , he passes Willy Wonka 's chocolate factory . A mysterious tinker recites the first lines of William Allingham 's poem `` The Fairies '' , and tells Charlie , `` Nobody ever goes in , and nobody ever comes out . '' Charlie rushes home to his widowed mother and bedridden grandparents . After telling Grandpa Joe about the tinker , Joe reveals that Wonka locked the factory because other candy makers , including rival Arthur Slugworth , sent in spies to steal his recipes . Wonka disappeared , but for three years resumed selling candy ; the origin of Wonka 's labor force is unknown . </P> <P> The next day , Wonka announces that he hid five `` Golden Tickets '' in chocolate Wonka Bars . Finders of the tickets will receive a factory tour and a lifetime supply of chocolate . Four of the tickets are found by Augustus Gloop , a gluttonous boy ; Veruca Salt , a spoiled girl ; Violet Beauregarde , a gum - chewing girl ; and Mike Teavee , a television - obsessed boy . As each winner 's announced on TV , a man whispers to them . Charlie opens two Wonka Bars but finds no Golden Ticket and loses hope . The newspapers announce the fifth ticket was found by a millionaire in Paraguay . Charlie finds money in a gutter and uses it to buy a Scrumdiddlyumptious bar . With the change , he buys a Wonka Bar for Joe . Walking home , as Charlie hears newspapers revealing that the Paraguayan millionaire 's ticket is a forgery , he opens the Wonka Bar and finds the fifth golden ticket . While rushing home , he is confronted by the same man seen whispering to the other winners , who introduces himself as Slugworth and offers a reward for a sample of Wonka 's latest creation , the Everlasting Gobstopper . </P> <P> Charlie returns home with the Golden Ticket and chooses Grandpa Joe as his chaperone and they sing `` I 've Got A Golden Ticket '' . The next day , Wonka greets the ticket winners and leads them inside where each signs a contract before the tour . The factory includes a river of chocolate , edible mushrooms , lickable wallpaper , and other sweets and inventions . As the visitors sample these , Wonka sings `` Pure Imagination '' . The visitors see Wonka 's workers , small men known as Oompa - Loompas , who sing their song whenever a ticket holder falls into a trap . Augustus falls into the chocolate river and is sucked up a pipe to the Fudge Room . In the Inventing Room , everyone receives an Everlasting Gobstopper . Violet becomes a large blueberry after chewing an experimental gum containing a three - course meal , despite Wonka 's warnings . The group reaches the Fizzy Lifting Drinks Room , where Charlie and Grandpa Joe ignore Wonka 's warning and sample the drinks . They float and have a near - fatal encounter with an exhaust fan before burping back to the ground . In the Chocolate Eggs Room , Veruca demands a golden goose for herself before falling into a garbage chute leading to the furnace , with her father falling in trying to rescue her . The group tests out Wonka 's Wonkavision , only to have Mike teleport himself and become only a few inches tall . </P> <P> Only Charlie and Grandpa Joe remain , but Wonka dismisses them without the promised chocolate . When Grandpa Joe asks him why , Wonka angrily explains that they violated the contract by stealing Fizzy Lifting Drinks and will receive nothing . An angered Grandpa Joe suggests to Charlie that he should give Slugworth the Gobstopper in revenge , but Charlie returns the candy back to Wonka . With this selfless act , Wonka declares Charlie as the winner . He reveals that Slugworth is actually `` Mr. Wilkinson '' , an employee of his , and the offer to buy the Gobstopper was a morality test which only Charlie passed . The trio enter the `` Wonkavator '' , a multi-directional glass elevator that flies out of the factory . Soaring over the city , Wonka reveals that his actual prize is the factory ; Wonka created the contest to find a worthy heir enough , and so Charlie and his family can immediately move in . Wonka then reminds Charlie not to forget about the man who suddenly received everything he ever wanted . Charlie asks , `` What ever happened to him ? '' to which Wonka replies , `` He lived happily ever after . '' </P> <P> </P> <H2> Main cast ( edit ) </H2> The main cast .

Wolper ) producing it . Stuart showed the book to Wolper , who happened to be in the midst of talks with the Quaker Oats Company regarding a vehicle to introduce a new candy bar from its Chicago - based Breaker Confections subsidiary ( since renamed the Willy Wonka Candy Company and sold to Nestl\u00e9 ) . Wolper persuaded the company , which had no previous experience in the film industry , to buy the rights to the book and finance the picture for the purpose of promoting a new Quaker Oats Wonka Bar . </P> <P> It was agreed that the film would be a children 's musical , and that Dahl himself would write the screenplay . However , the title was changed to Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory . </P> <P> Screenwriter David Seltzer conceived a gimmick exclusively for the film that had Wonka quoting numerous literary sources , such as Arthur O'Shaughnessy 's Ode , Oscar Wilde 's The Importance of Being Earnest , Samuel Taylor Coleridge 's The Rime of the Ancient Mariner and William Shakespeare 's The Merchant of Venice . Seltzer also worked Slugworth ( only mentioned as a rival candy maker in the book ) into the plot as an actual character ( only to be revealed to be Wilkinson , one of Wonka 's agents , at the end of the film ) . </P> <H3> Casting ( edit ) </H3> <P> All six members of Monty Python : Graham Chapman , John Cleese , Eric Idle , Terry Gilliam , Terry Jones and Michael Palin , expressed interest in playing Wonka , but at the time they were deemed not big enough names for an international audience . Three of the members , Cleese , Idle and Palin , were later seriously considered for the same role in Tim Burton 's version . </P> <P> Before Wilder was officially cast for the role , producers considered Fred Astaire , Joel Grey , Ron Moody and Jon Pertwee . Spike Milligan was Roald Dahl 's original choice to play Willy Wonka . Peter Sellers even begged Dahl for the role . </P> <P> When Wilder was cast for the role , he accepted it on one condition : </P> <P> When I make my first entrance , I 'd like to come out of the door carrying a cane and then walk toward the crowd with a limp . After the crowd sees Willy Wonka is a cripple , they all whisper to themselves and then become deathly quiet . As I walk toward them , my cane sinks into one of the cobblestones I 'm walking on and stands straight up , by itself ; but I keep on walking , until I realize that I no longer have my cane . I start to fall forward , and just before I hit the ground , I do a beautiful forward somersault and bounce back up , to great applause . </P> -- Gene Wilder <P> The reason why Wilder wanted this in the film was that `` from that time on , no one will know if I 'm lying or telling the truth . '' </P> <P> Jean Stapleton turned down the role of Mrs. Teevee . Jim Backus was considered for the role of Sam Beauregarde . Sammy Davis , Jr. wanted to play Bill , the candy store owner , but Stuart did not like the idea because he felt that the presence of a big star in the candy store scene would break the reality . Nevertheless , Davis ' recording of the film 's opening musical number , `` The Candy Man , '' would top the Billboard magazine record charts in 1972 , despite the fact that Davis initially hated the song . Anthony Newley also wanted to play Bill , but Stuart also objected to this for the same reason . </P> <H3> Filming ( edit ) </H3> <P> Principal photography commenced on April 30 , 1970 , and ended on November 19 , 1970 . The primary shooting location was Munich , Bavaria , West Germany , because it was significantly cheaper than filming in the United States and the setting was conducive to Wonka 's factory ; Stuart also liked the ambiguity and unfamiliarity of the location . External shots of the factory were filmed at the gasworks of Stadtwerke M\u00fcnchen ( Emmy - Noether - Stra\u00dfe 10 ) ; the entrance and side buildings still exist . The exterior of Charlie Bucket 's house , which was only a set constructed for the film , was filmed at Quellenstra\u00dfe in Munich , Bavaria . Charlie 's school was filmed at Katholisches Pfarramt St. Sylvester , Biedersteiner Stra\u00dfe 1 in Munich . Bill 's Candy Shop was filmed at Lilienstra\u00dfe , Munich . The closing sequence when the Wonkavator is flying above the factory is footage of N\u00f6rdlingen in Bavaria . </P> <Ul> <Li> <P> Munich Gasworks as it appears today ( building on the left ) </P> </Li> <Li> <P> Munich Gasworks as it appears today </P> </Li> <Li> <P> N\u00f6rdlingen , the town seen from above at the end of the film </P> </Li> </Ul> <P> Production designer Harper Goff centered the factory on the massive Chocolate Room . According to Paris Themmen , who played Mike Teevee , `` The river was made of water with food coloring . At one point , they poured some cocoa powder into it to try to thicken it but it did n't really work . When asked this question , Michael B\u00f6llner , who played Augustus Gloop , answers , ' It vas dirty , stinking vater . ' '' </P> <P> When interviewed for the 30th anniversary special edition , Gene Wilder stated that he enjoyed working with most of the child actors , but said that he and the crew had some problems with Paris Themmen , claiming that he was `` a handful '' . </P> <H3> Promotion ( edit ) </H3> <P> Before its release , the film received advance publicity though TV commercials offering a `` Willy Wonka candy factory kit '' for sending $1.00 and two seals from boxes of Quaker cereals such as King Vitaman , Life and any of the Cap'n Crunch brands . </P> <H2> Reception ( edit ) </H2> <P> Willy Wonka was released on June 30 , 1971 . The film was not a big success , being the fifty - third highest - grossing film of the year in the U.S. , earning just over $2.1 million on its opening weekend , although it received positive reviews from critics such as Roger Ebert , who compared it to The Wizard of Oz . </P> <P> By the mid-1980s , Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory had experienced a spike in popularity thanks in large part to repeated television broadcasts and home video sales . Following a 25th anniversary theatrical re-release in 1996 , it was released on DVD the next year , allowing it to reach a new generation of viewers . The film was released as a remastered special edition on DVD and VHS in 2001 to commemorate the film 's 30th anniversary . In 2003 , Entertainment Weekly ranked it 25th in the `` Top 50 Cult Movies '' of all time . </P> <P> As of 2017 , the film holds a 90 % `` Fresh '' rating on Rotten Tomatoes with an average rating of 7.7 / 10 based on 42 reviews . The site 's critical consensus states : `` Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory is strange yet comforting , full of narrative detours that do n't always work but express the film 's uniqueness '' . </P> <P> Willy Wonka was ranked No. 74 on Bravo 's 100 Scariest Movie Moments for the `` scary tunnel '' scene . </P> <H3> Dahl 's reaction ( edit ) </H3> <P> Dahl disowned the film , the script of which was partially rewritten by David Seltzer after Dahl failed to meet deadlines . Dahl said he was `` disappointed '' because `` he thought it placed too much emphasis on Willy Wonka and not enough on Charlie '' , as well as the casting of Gene Wilder instead of Spike Milligan . Dahl was also `` infuriated '' by the deviations in the plot Seltzer devised in his draft of the screenplay , including the conversion of Slugworth , a minor character in the book , into a spy ( so that the movie could have a villain ) and the `` fizzy lifting drinks '' scene along with music other than the original Oompa Loompa compositions ( including `` Pure Imagination '' and `` The Candy Man '' ) , and the ending dialogue for the movie . In 1996 , Dahl 's second wife Felicity commented on her husband 's objections towards the film saying `` they always want to change a book 's storyline . What makes Hollywood think children want the endings changed for a film , when they accept it in a book ? '' </P> <H2> Television ( edit ) </H2> <P> The film made its television debut on November 23 , 1975 on NBC . There was some controversy with the showing as the Oakland Raiders vs Washington Redskins ( 26 - 23 ) Football game went into overtime , and the first 40 minutes of the movie were cut . The film placed 19th in the TV Ratings for the week ending Nov 23 , beating out The Streets of San Francisco and Little House on the Prairie . The next TV showing of the film was on May 2 , 1976 , where it placed 46th in the ratings . Some TV listings indicate the showing was part of the World of Disney time slot . </P> <H2> Adaptation ( edit ) </H2> Main article : Tom and Jerry : Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory <P> In 2017 , an adaptation of the film with Tom and Jerry was released . Tom and Jerry : Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory stars JP Karliak as Willy Wonka and is dedicated to Gene Wilder , who died under a year before the release . </P> <H2> Home media ( edit ) </H2> <P> The film was first released on DVD in 1997 / 1999 in a `` 25th anniversary edition '' as a double sided disc containing a widescreen and `` standard '' version . The `` standard '' version is an open matte print , where the mattes used to make the image widescreen are removed , revealing information originally intended to be hidden from viewers . VHS copies were also available , but only containing the `` standard '' version . </P> <P> A special edition DVD was released , celebrating the film 's 30th anniversary , on August 28 , 2001 , but in fullscreen only . Due to the lack of a letterboxed release , fan petitioning eventually led Warner Home Video to issue a widescreen version on November 13 , 2001 . It was also released on VHS , with only one of the special features ( a making - of feature ) . Several original cast members reunited to film documentary footage for this special edition DVD release . The two editions featured restored sound , and better picture quality . In addition to the documentary , the DVD included a trailer , a gallery , and audio commentary by the cast . </P> <P> In 2007 , Warner Home Video released the film on HD DVD with all the bonus features from the 2001 DVD . The film was released on Blu - ray on October 20 , 2009 . It includes all the bonus features from the 2001 DVD and 2007 HD - DVD as well as a 38 - page book . </P> <P> In 2011 , a new deluxe - 40th - anniversary edition Blu - ray / DVD set was released on November 1 , consisting of the film on Blu - ray Disc and DVD as well as a bonus features disc . The set also included a variety of rarities such as a Wonka Bar - designed tin , four scented pencils , a scented eraser , a book detailing the making of the film , original production papers and a Golden Ticket to win a trip to Los Angeles . The set is now out of print . </P> <H2> Music ( edit ) </H2> <P> The Academy Award - nominated original score and songs were composed by Leslie Bricusse and Anthony Newley , and musical direction was by Walter Scharf . The soundtrack was first released by Paramount Records in 1971 . On October 8 , 1996 , Hip - O Records ( in conjunction with MCA Records , which by then owned the Paramount catalog ) , released the soundtrack on CD as a `` 25th Anniversary Edition '' . </P> <P> The music and songs , in order of appearance , are : </P> <Ol> <Li> `` Main Title '' -- Instrumental medley of `` ( I 've Got A ) Golden Ticket '' and `` Pure Imagination '' </Li> <Li> `` The Candy Man '' -- Aubrey Woods </Li> <Li> `` Cheer Up , Charlie '' -- Diana Lee ( dubbing over Diana Sowle ) </Li> <Li> `` ( I 've Got A ) Golden Ticket '' -- Jack Albertson and Peter Ostrum </Li> <Li> `` Pure Imagination '' -- Gene Wilder </Li> <Li> `` Oompa Loompa ( Augustus ) '' -- The Oompa Loompas </Li> <Li> `` The Wondrous Boat Ride '' / `` The Rowing Song '' -- Gene Wilder </Li> <Li> `` Oompa Loompa ( Violet ) '' -- The Oompa Loompas </Li> <Li> `` I Want It Now !
