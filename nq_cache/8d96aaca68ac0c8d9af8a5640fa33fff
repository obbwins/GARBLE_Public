Argentina 's economic performance has historically been very uneven , in which high economic growth alternated with severe recessions , particularly during the late twentieth century , and income maldistribution and poverty increased . Early in the twentieth century Argentina had one of the ten highest per capita GDP levels in the world , at par with Canada and Australia and surpassing both France and Italy . Argentina today ( 2018 ) is plagued by currency crisis which involved a potential bailout from International Monetary Fund . The currency declined by 18 % over a period of 12 days in May 2018 to more than 25 Argentine pesos per U.S. Dollar . </P> <P> Argentina is considered an emerging market by the FTSE Global Equity Index ( 2018 ) , and is one of the G - 20 major economies . </P> <H2> Contents </H2> <Ul> <Li> 1 History </Li> <Li> 2 Sectors <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Agriculture </Li> <Li> 2.2 Natural resources </Li> <Li> 2.3 Industry </Li> <Li> 2.4 Services <Ul> <Li> 2.4. 1 Banking </Li> <Li> 2.4. 2 Tourism </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2.5 GDP by value added </Li> <Li> 2.6 Energy </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Infrastructure </Li> <Li> 4 Foreign trade </Li> <Li> 5 Foreign investment </Li> <Li> 6 Issues <Ul> <Li> 6.1 Reliability of official CPI estimates </Li> <Li> 6.2 Inflation </Li> <Li> 6.3 Income distribution </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 7 See also </Li> <Li> 8 References </Li> <Li> 9 Further reading </Li> <Li> 10 External links </Li> </Ul> <H2> History ( edit ) </H2> Main article : Economic history of Argentina Historical growth of Argentina from 1961 to 2016 <P> Prior to the 1880s , Argentina was a relatively isolated backwater , dependent on the salted meat , wool , leather , and hide industries for both the greater part of its foreign exchange and the generation of domestic income and profits . The Argentine economy began to experience swift growth after 1880 through the export of livestock and grain commodities , as well as through British and French investment , marking the beginning of a fifty - year era of significant economic expansion and mass European immigration . </P> <P> During its most vigorous period , from 1880 to 1905 , this expansion resulted in a 7.5-fold growth in GDP , averaging about 8 % annually . One important measure of development , GDP per capita , rose from 35 % of the United States average to about 80 % during that period . Growth then slowed considerably , such that by 1941 Argentina 's real per capita GDP was roughly half that of the U.S. Even so , from 1890 to 1950 the country 's per capita income was similar to that of Western Europe ; although income in Argentina remained considerably less evenly distributed . </P> <P> The Great Depression caused Argentine GDP to fall by a fourth between 1929 and 1932 . Having recovered its lost ground by the late 1930s partly through import substitution , the economy continued to grow modestly during World War II ( in contrast to the recession caused by the previous world war ) . The war led to a reduced availability of imports and higher prices for Argentine exports that combined to create a US $1.6 billion cumulative surplus , a third of which was blocked as inconvertible deposits in the Bank of England by the Roca -- Runciman Treaty . Benefiting from innovative self - financing and government loans alike , value added in manufacturing nevertheless surpassed that of agriculture for the first time in 1943 , employed over 1 million by 1947 , and allowed the need for imported consumer goods to decline from 40 % of the total to 10 % by 1950 . </P> <P> The populist administration of Juan Per\u00f3n nationalized the Central Bank , railways , and other strategic industries and services from 1945 to 1955 . The subsequent enactment of developmentalism after 1958 , though partial , was followed by a promising fifteen years . Inflation first became a chronic problem during this period ( it averaged 26 % annually from 1944 to 1974 ) ; but though it did not become fully `` developed , '' from 1932 to 1974 Argentina 's economy grew almost fivefold ( or 3.8 % in annual terms ) while its population only doubled . While unremarkable , this expansion was well - distributed and so resulted in several noteworthy changes in Argentine society - most notably the development of the largest proportional middle class ( 40 % of the population by the 1960s ) in Latin America as well as the region 's highest - paid , most unionized working class . </P> <P> The economy , however , declined during the military dictatorship from 1976 to 1983 , and for some time afterwards . The dictatorship 's chief economist , Jos\u00e9 Alfredo Mart\u00ednez de Hoz , advanced a corrupt , anti-labor policy of financial liberalization that increased the debt burden and interrupted industrial development and upward social mobility . Over 400,000 companies of all sizes went bankrupt by 1982 , and neoliberal economic policies prevailing from 1983 through 2001 failed to reverse the situation . </P> <P> Record foreign debt interest payments , tax evasion , and capital flight resulted in a balance of payments crisis that plagued Argentina with severe stagflation from 1975 to 1990 , including a bout of hyperinflation in 1989 and 1990 . Attempting to remedy this situation , economist Domingo Cavallo pegged the peso to the U.S. dollar in 1991 and limited the growth in the money supply . His team then embarked on a path of trade liberalization , deregulation , and privatization . Inflation dropped to single digits and GDP grew by one third in four years . </P> <P> External economic shocks , as well as a dependency on volatile short - term capital and debt to maintain the overvalued fixed exchange rate , diluted benefits , causing erratic economic growth from 1995 and the eventual collapse in 2001 . That year and the next , the economy suffered its sharpest decline since 1930 ; by 2002 , Argentina had defaulted on its debt , its GDP had declined by nearly 20 % in four years , unemployment reached 25 % , and the peso had depreciated 70 % after being devalued and floated . </P> <P> Argentina 's socio - economic situation has since been steadily improving . Expansionary policies and commodity exports triggered a rebound in GDP from 2003 onward . This trend has been largely maintained , creating over five million jobs and encouraging domestic consumption and fixed investment . Social programs were strengthened , and a number of important firms privatized during the 1990s were renationalized beginning in 2003 . These include the postal service , AySA ( the water utility serving Buenos Aires ) , Pension funds ( transferred to ANSES ) , Aerol\u00edneas Argentinas , the energy firm YPF , and the railways . </P> <P> The economy nearly doubled from 2002 to 2011 , growing an average of 7.1 % annually and around 9 % for five consecutive years between 2003 and 2007 . Real wages rose by around 72 % from their low point in 2003 to 2013 . The global recession did affect the economy in 2009 , with growth slowing to nearly zero ; but high economic growth then resumed , and GDP expanded by around 9 % in both 2010 and 2011 . Foreign exchange controls , austerity measures , persistent inflation , and downturns in Brazil , Europe , and other important trade partners , contributed to slower growth beginning in 2012 , however . Growth averaged just 1.3 % from 2012 to 2014 , and rose to 2.4 % in 2015 . </P> <P> The Argentine government bond market is based on GDP - linked bonds , and investors , both foreign and domestic , netted record yields amid renewed growth . Argentine debt restructuring offers in 2005 and 2010 resumed payments on the majority of its almost US $100 billion in defaulted bonds and other debt from 2001 . </P> <P> Holdouts controlling 7 % of the bonds , including some small investors , hedge funds , and vulture funds led by Paul Singer 's Cayman Islands - based NML Capital Limited , rejected the 2005 and 2010 offers to exchange their defaulted bonds . Singer , who demanded US $832 million for Argentine bonds purchased for US $49 million in the secondary market in 2008 , attempted to seize Argentine government assets abroad and sued to stop payments from Argentina to the 93 % who had accepted the earlier swaps despite the steep discount . Bondholders who instead accepted the 2005 offer of 30 cents on the dollar , had by 2012 received returns of about 90 % according to estimates by Morgan Stanley . Argentina settled with virtually all holdouts in February 2016 at a cost of US $9.3 billion ; NML received US $2.4 billion , a 392 % return on the original value of the bonds . </P> <P> While the Argentine Government considers debt left over from illegitimate governments unconstitutional odious debt , it has continued servicing this debt despite the annual cost of around US $14 billion and despite being nearly locked out of international credit markets with annual bond issues since 2002 averaging less than US $2 billion ( which precludes most debt roll over ) . </P> <P> Argentina has nevertheless continued to hold successful bond issues , as the country 's stock market , consumer confidence , and overall economy continue to grow . The country 's successful , US $16.5 billion bond sale in April 2016 was the largest in emerging market history . </P> <P> On May 2018 , Argentina 's government asked to the International Monetary Fund for its intervention , with an emergency loan for a thirty billion bailout , as it is has been reported by Bloomberg . </P> <P> On May 2018 the official estimated inflation has peaked up to 25 percent a year , and on May 4 Argentina 's central bank has raised interest rates on pesos to 40 percent from 27.25 percent , which is the highest in the world , since the national currency has lost 18 % of its value by the beginning of the year . </P> <H2> Sectors ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Agriculture ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Agriculture in Argentina Soy field in Argentina 's fertile Pampas . The versatile legume makes up about half the nation 's crop production . Vinyard in Mendoza Province . The country is the fifth largest producer in the world . <P> Argentina is one of the world 's major agricultural producers , ranking among the top producers in most of the following , exporters of beef , citrus fruit , grapes , honey , maize , sorghum , soybeans , squash , sunflower seeds , wheat , and yerba mate . Agriculture accounted for 9 % of GDP in 2010 , and around one fifth of all exports ( not including processed food and feed , which are another third ) . Commercial harvests reached 103 million tons in 2010 , of which over 54 million were oilseeds ( mainly soy and sunflower ) , and over 46 million were cereals ( mainly maize , wheat , and sorghum ) . </P> <P> Soy and its byproducts , mainly animal feed and vegetable oils , are major export commodities with one fourth of the total ; cereals added another 10 % . Cattle - raising is also a major industry , though mostly for domestic consumption ; beef , leather and dairy were 5 % of total exports . Sheep - raising and wool are important in Patagonia , though these activities have declined by half since 1990 . Biodiesel , however , has become one of the fastest growing agro-industrial activities , with over US $2 billion in exports in 2011 . </P> <P> Fruits and vegetables made up 4 % of exports : apples and pears in the R\u00edo Negro valley ; rice , oranges and other citrus in the northwest and Mesopotamia ; grapes and strawberries in Cuyo ( the west ) , and berries in the far south . Cotton and tobacco are major crops in the Gran Chaco , sugarcane and chile peppers in the northwest , and olives and garlic in the west . Yerba mate tea ( Misiones ) , tomatoes ( Salta ) and peaches ( Mendoza ) are grown for domestic consumption . Organic farming is growing in Argentina , and the nearly 3 million hectares ( 7.5 million acres ) of organic cultivation is second only to Australia . Argentina is the world 's fifth - largest wine producer , and fine wine production has taken major leaps in quality . A growing export , total viticulture potential is far from having been met . Mendoza is the largest wine region , followed by San Juan . </P> <P> Government policy towards the lucrative agrarian sector is a subject of , at times , contentious debate in Argentina . A grain embargo by farmers protesting an increase in export taxes for their products began in March 2008 , and , following a series of failed negotiations , strikes and lockouts largely subsided only with the 16 July , defeat of the export tax - hike in the Senate . </P> <P> Argentine fisheries bring in about a million tons of catch annually , and are centered on Argentine hake , which makes up 50 % of the catch ; pollock , squid , and centolla crab are also widely harvested . Forestry has long history in every Argentine region , apart from the pampas , accounting for almost 14 million m3 of roundwood harvests . Eucalyptus , pine , and elm ( for cellulose ) are also grown , mainly for domestic furniture , as well as paper products ( 1.5 million tons ) . Fisheries and logging each account for 2 % of exports . </P> The Vaca Muerta shale oil field holds 16.2 billion barrels of oil and 308 cubic feet of natural gas . It is estimated to be the third largest in the world . <H3> Natural resources ( edit ) </H3> See also : Mining in Argentina <P> Mining and other extractive activities , such as gas and petroleum , are growing industries , increasing from 2 % of GDP in 1980 to around 4 % today . The northwest and San Juan Province are the main regions of activity . Coal is mined in Santa Cruz Province . Metals and minerals mined include borate , copper , lead , magnesium , sulfur , tungsten , uranium , zinc , silver , titanium , and gold , whose production was boosted after 1997 by the Bajo de Alumbrera mine in Catamarca Province and Barrick Gold investments a decade later in San Juan . Metal ore exports soared from US $200 million in 1996 to US $1.2 billion in 2004 , and to over US $3 billion in 2010 . </P> <P> Around 35 million m3 each of petroleum and petroleum fuels are produced , as well as 50 billion m3 of natural gas , making the nation self - sufficient in these staples , and generating around 10 % of exports . The most important oil fields lie in Patagonia and Cuyo . A network of pipelines ( next to Mexico 's , the second - longest in Latin America ) send raw product to Bah\u00eda Blanca , center of the petrochemical industry , and to the La Plata - Greater Buenos Aires - Rosario industrial belt . </P> <H3> Industry ( edit ) </H3> <P> Manufacturing is the largest single sector in the nation 's economy ( 15 % of GDP ) , and is well - integrated into Argentine agriculture , with half the nation 's industrial exports being agricultural in nature . Based on food processing and textiles during its early development in the first half of the 20th century , industrial production has become highly diversified in Argentina . Leading sectors by production value are : Food processing and beverages ; motor vehicles and auto parts ; refinery products , and biodiesel ; chemicals and pharmaceuticals ; steel and aluminium ; and industrial and farm machinery ; electronics and home appliances . These latter include over three million big ticket items , as well as an array of electronics , kitchen appliances and cellular phones , among others . </P> <P> Argentina 's auto industry produced 791,000 motor vehicles in 2013 , and exported 433,000 ( mainly to Brazil , which in turn exported a somewhat larger number to Argentina ) ; Argentina 's domestic new auto market reached a record 964,000 in 2013 . Beverages are another significant sector , and Argentina has long been among the top five wine producing countries in the world ; beer overtook wine production in 2000 , and today leads by nearly two billion liters a year to one . Other manufactured goods include : glass and cement ; plastics and tires ; lumber products ; textiles ; tobacco products ; recording and print media ; furniture ; apparel and leather . </P> <P> Most manufacturing is organized in the 314 industrial parks operating nationwide as of 2012 , a fourfold increase over the past decade . Nearly half the industries are based in the Greater Buenos Aires area , although C\u00f3rdoba , Rosario , and Ushuaia are also significant industrial centers ; the latter city became the nation 's leading center of electronics production during the 1980s . The production of computers , laptops , and servers grew by 160 % in 2011 , to nearly 3.4 million units , and covered two - thirds of local demand . Argentina has also become an important manufacturer of cell phones , providing about 80 % of all devices sold in the country . Another important rubric historically dominated by imports - farm machinery - was similarly replaced by domestic production , which covered 60 % of demand by 2013 . Production of cell phones , computers , and similar products is actually an `` assembly '' industry , with the majority of the higher technology components being imported , and the designs of products originating from foreign countries . High labour costs for Argentina assembly work tend to limit product sales penetration to Latin America , where regional trade treaties exist . </P> <P> Construction permits nationwide covered over 15 million m2 ( 160 million ft2 ) in 2013 . The construction sector accounts for over 5 % of GDP , and two - thirds of construction is for residential buildings . </P> <P> Argentine electric output totaled over 133 billion Kwh in 2013 . This was generated in large part through well developed natural gas and hydroelectric resources . Nuclear energy is also of high importance , and the country is one of the largest producers and exporters , alongside Canada and Russia of cobalt - 60 , a radioactive isotope widely used in cancer therapy . </P> <H3> Services ( edit ) </H3> <P> The service sector is the largest contributor to total GDP , accounting for over 60 % . Argentina enjoys a diversified service sector , which includes well - developed social , corporate , financial , insurance , real estate , transport , communication services , and tourism . </P> <P> The telecommunications sector has been growing at a fast pace , and the economy benefits from widespread access to communications services . These include : 77 % of the population with access to mobile phones , 95 % of whom use smartphones ; Internet ( over 32 million users , or 75 % of the population ) ; and broadband services ( accounting for nearly all 14 million accounts ) . Regular telephone services , with 9.5 million lines , and mail services are also robust . Total telecom revenues reached more than $17.8 billion in 2013 , and while only one in three retail stores in Argentina accepted online purchases in 2013 E-commerce reached US $4.5 billion in sales . </P> <P> Trade in services remained in deficit , however , with US $15 billion in service exports in 2013 and US $19 billion in imports . Business Process Outsourcing became the leading Argentine service export , and reached US $3 billion . Advertising revenues from contracts abroad were estimated at over US $1.2 billion . </P> <P> Tourism is an increasingly important sector and provided 4 % of direct economic output ( over US $17 billion ) in 2012 ; around 70 % of tourism sector activity by value is domestic . </P> Banking ( edit ) View of Buenos Aires Central Business District from the Costanera Sur Ecological Reserve . Protestors outside BankBoston branch during the corralito . Main article : Banking in Argentina <P> Argentine banking , whose deposits exceeded US $120 billion in December 2012 , developed around public sector banks , but is now dominated by the private sector . The private sector banks account for most of the 80 active institutions ( over 4,000 branches ) and holds nearly 60 % of deposits and loans , and as many foreign - owned banks as local ones operate in the country . The largest bank in Argentina by far , however , has long been the public Banco de la Naci\u00f3n Argentina . Not to be confused with the Central Bank , this institution now accounts for 30 % of total deposits and a fifth of its loan portfolio . </P> <P> During the 1990s , Argentina 's financial system was consolidated and strengthened . Deposits grew from less than US $15 billion in 1991 to over US $80 billion in 2000 , while outstanding credit ( 70 % of it to the private sector ) tripled to nearly US $100 billion . </P> <P> The banks largely lent US dollars and took deposits in Argentine pesos , and when the peso lost most of its value in early 2002 , many borrowers again found themselves hard pressed to keep up . Delinquencies tripled to about 37 % . Over a fifth of deposits had been withdrawn by December 2001 , when Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo imposed a near freeze on cash withdrawals . The lifting of the restriction a year later was bittersweet , being greeted calmly , if with some umbrage , at not having these funds freed at their full U.S. dollar value . Some fared worse , as owners of the now - defunct Velox Bank defrauded their clients of up to US $800 million . </P> <P> Credit in Argentina is still relatively tight . Lending has been increasing 40 % a year since 2004 , and delinquencies are down to less than 2 % . Still , credit outstanding to the private sector is , in real terms , slightly below its 1998 peak , and as a percent of GDP ( around 18 % ) quite low by international standards . The prime rate , which had hovered around 10 % in the 1990s , hit 67 % in 2002 . Although it returned to normal levels quickly , inflation , and more recently , global instability , have been affecting it again . The prime rate was over 20 % for much of 2009 , and around 17 % since the first half of 2010 . </P> <P> Partly a function of this and past instability , Argentines have historically held more deposits overseas than domestically . The estimated US $173 billion in overseas accounts and investment exceeded the domestic monetary base ( M3 ) by nearly US $10 billion in 2012 . </P> Tourism ( edit ) Main article : Tourism in Argentina Tour bus in Buenos Aires . <P> According to World Economic Forum 's 2017 Travel & Tourism Competitiveness Report , tourism generated over US $22 billion , or 3.9 % of GDP , and the industry employed more than 671,000 people , or approximately 3.7 % of the total workforce . Tourism from abroad contributed US $5.3 billion , having become the third largest source of foreign exchange in 2004 . Around 5.7 million foreign visitors arrived in 2017 , reflecting a doubling in visitors since 2002 despite a relative appreciation of the peso . </P> <P> Argentines , who have long been active travelers within their own country , accounted for over 80 % , and international tourism has also seen healthy growth ( nearly doubling since 2001 ) . Stagnant for over two decades , domestic travel increased strongly in the last few years , and visitors are flocking to a country seen as affordable , exceptionally diverse , and safe . </P> <P> Foreign tourism , both to and from Argentina , is increasing as well . INDEC recorded 5.2 million foreign tourist arrivals and 6.7 million departures in 2013 ; of these , 32 % arrived from Brazil , 19 % from Europe , 10 % from the United States and Canada , 10 % from Chile , 24 % from the rest of the Western Hemisphere , and 5 % from the rest of the world . Around 48 % of visitors arrived by commercial flight , 40 % by motor travel ( mainly from neighboring Brazil ) , and 12 % by sea . Cruise liner arrivals are the fastest growing type of foreign tourism to Argentina ; a total of 160 liners carrying 510,000 passengers arrived at the Port of Buenos Aires in 2013 , an eightfold increase in a just a decade . </P> <H3> GDP by value added ( edit ) </H3> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Supply sector ( % of GDP in current prices ) </Th> <Th> 1993 - 2001 </Th> <Th> 2002 - 2005 </Th> <Th> 2006 - 2009 </Th> <Th> 2010 - 2013 </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Agriculture , forestry , and fishing </Td> <Td> 5.4 </Td> <Td> 10.3 </Td> <Td> 7.3 </Td> <Td> 7.3 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Mining </Td> <Td> 2.0 </Td> <Td> 5.9 </Td> <Td> 4.8 </Td> <Td> 4.2 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Manufacturing </Td> <Td> 18.5 </Td> <Td> 23.2 </Td> <Td> 19.8 </Td> <Td> 16.8 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Public utilities </Td> <Td> 2.2 </Td> <Td> 1.7 </Td> <Td> 2.3 </Td> <Td> 3.1 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Construction </Td> <Td> 5.5 </Td> <Td> 3.9 </Td> <Td> 6.2 </Td> <Td> 5.6 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Commerce and tourism </Td> <Td> 17.3 </Td> <Td> 14.0 </Td> <Td> 15.6 </Td> <Td> 14.4 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Transport and communications </Td> <Td> 8.3 </Td> <Td> 8.7 </Td> <Td> 7.3 </Td> <Td> 6.7 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Financial services </Td> <Td> 4.2 </Td> <Td> 4.4 </Td> <Td> 3.2 </Td> <Td> 3.4 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Real estate and business services </Td> <Td> 16.5 </Td> <Td> 11.7 </Td> <Td> 13.7 </Td> <Td> 12.9 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Public administration and defense </Td> <Td> 6.3 </Td> <Td> 5.4 </Td> <Td> 5.6 </Td> <Td> 7.4 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Health and education </Td> <Td> 8.4 </Td> <Td> 6.9 </Td> <Td> 8.9 </Td> <Td> 11.9 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Personal and other services </Td> <Td> 5.4 </Td> <Td> 3.9 </Td> <Td> 5.3 </Td> <Td> 6.3 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Total </Th> <Th> 100.0 </Th> <Th> 100.0 </Th> <Th> 100.0 </Th> <Th> 100.0 </Th> </Tr> </Table> <P> </P> <H3> Energy ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Energy in Argentina A YPF refinery . Atucha II Nuclear Power Plant under construction . <P> Electricity generation in Argentina totaled 133.3 billion Kwh in 2013 . The electricity sector in Argentina constitutes the third largest power market in Latin America . It mainly still relies on centralised generation by natural gas power generation ( 51 % ) , hydroelectricity ( 28 % ) , and oil - fired generation ( 12 % ) . Reserves of shale gas and oil in the Vaca Muerta oil field and elsewhere are estimated to be the world 's third - largest . </P> <P> Despite the country 's large untapped wind and solar potential new renewable energy technologies and distributed energy generation are barely exploited . Wind energy is the fastest growing among new renewable sources . Fifteen wind farms have been developed since 1994 in Argentina , the only country in the region to produce wind turbines . The 55 MW of installed capacity in these in 2010 will increase by 895 MW upon the completion of new wind farms begun that year . Solar power is being promoted with the goal of expanding installed solar capacity from 6 MW to 300 , and total renewable energy capacity from 625 MW to 3,000 MW . </P> <P> Argentina is in the process of commissioning large centralised energy generation and transmission projects . An important number of these projects are being financed by the government through trust funds , while independent private initiative is limited as it has not fully recovered yet from the effects of the Argentine economic crisis . </P> <P> The first of the three nuclear reactors was inaugurated in 1974 , and in 2015 nuclear power generated 5 % of the country 's energy output . </P> <P> The electricity sector was unbundled in generation , transmission and distribution by the reforms carried out in the early 1990s . Generation occurs in a competitive and mostly liberalized market in which 75 % of the generation capacity is owned by private utilities . In contrast , the transmission and distribution sectors are highly regulated and much less competitive than generation . </P> <H2> Infrastructure ( edit ) </H2> Main article : Transportation in Argentina Railway workers laying track on the Belgrano Railway , following state investment . Long distance passenger train operated by Trenes Argentinos . Aeroparque Jorge Newbery in Buenos Aires <P> Argentina 's transport infrastructure is relatively advanced , and at a higher standard than the rest of Latin America . There are over 230,000 km ( 144,000 mi ) of roads ( not including private rural roads ) of which 72,000 km ( 45,000 mi ) are paved , and 2,800 kilometres ( 1,700 mi ) are expressways , many of which are privatized tollways . Having tripled in length in the last decade , multilane expressways now connect several major cities with more under construction . Expressways are , however , currently inadequate to deal with local traffic , as over 12 million motor vehicles were registered nationally as of 2012 ( the highest , proportionately , in the region ) . </P> <P> The railway network has a total length of 37,856 kilometres ( 23,523 mi ) , though at the network 's peak this figure was 47,000 km ( 29,204 mi ) . After decades of declining service and inadequate maintenance , most intercity passenger services shut down in 1992 following the privatization of the country 's railways and the breaking up of the state rail company , while thousands of kilometers fell into disuse . Outside Greater Buenos Aires most rail lines still in operation are freight related , carrying around 23 million tons a year . The metropolitan rail lines in and around Buenos Aires remained in great demand owing in part to their easy access to the Buenos Aires Underground , and the commuter rail network with its 833 kilometres ( 518 mi ) length carries around 1.4 million passengers daily . </P> <P> In April 2015 , by overwhelming majority the Argentine Senate passed a law which re-created Ferrocarriles Argentinos as Nuevos Ferrocarriles Argentinos , effectively re-nationalising the country 's railways . In the years leading up to this move , the country 's railways had seen significant investment from the state , purchasing new rolling stock , re-opening lines closed under privatization and re-nationalising companies such as the Belgrano Cargas freight operator . Some of these re-opened services include the General Roca Railway service to Mar del Plata , the Tren a las Nubes tourist train and the General Mitre Railway service from Buenos Aires to C\u00f3rdoba . while brand new services include the Posadas - Encarnaci\u00f3n International Train . </P> <P> Inaugurated in 1913 , the Buenos Aires Underground was the first underground rail system built in Latin America , the Spanish speaking world and the Southern Hemisphere . No longer the most extensive in South America , its 60 kilometres ( 37 mi ) of track carry a million passengers daily . </P> <P> Argentina has around 11,000 km ( 6,835 mi ) of navigable waterways , and these carry more cargo than do the country 's freight railways . This includes an extensive network of canals , though Argentina is blessed with ample natural waterways as well , the most significant among these being the R\u00edo de la Plata , Paran\u00e1 , Uruguay , R\u00edo Negro , and Paraguay rivers . The Port of Buenos Aires , inaugurated in 1925 , is the nation 's largest ; it handled 11 million tons of freight and transported 1.8 million passengers in 2013 . </P> <P> Aerol\u00edneas Argentinas is the country 's main airline , providing both extensive domestic and international service . Austral L\u00edneas A\u00e9reas is Aerol\u00edneas Argentinas ' subsidiary , with a route system that covers almost all of the country . LADE is a military - run commercial airline that flies extensive domestic services . The nation 's 33 airports handled air travel totalling 25.8 million passengers in 2013 , of which domestic flights carried over 14.5 million ; the nation 's two busiest airports , Jorge Newbery and Ministro Pistarini International Airports , boarded around 9 million flights each . </P> <H2> Foreign trade ( edit ) </H2> Argentina Export Treemap by Product ( 2012 ) from Harvard Atlas of Economic Complexity Main article : Foreign trade of Argentina <P> Argentine exports are fairly well diversified . However , although agricultural raw materials are over 20 % of the total exports , agricultural goods still account for over 50 % of exports when processed foods are included . Soy products alone ( soybeans , vegetable oil ) account for almost one fourth of the total . Cereals , mostly maize and wheat , which were Argentina 's leading export during much of the twentieth century , make up less than one tenth now . </P> <P> Industrial goods today account for over a third of Argentine exports . Motor vehicles and auto parts are the leading industrial export , and over 12 % of the total merchandise exports . Chemicals , steel , aluminum , machinery , and plastics account for most of the remaining industrial exports . Trade in manufactures has historically been in deficit for Argentina , however , and despite the nation 's overall trade surplus , its manufacturing trade deficit exceeded US $30 billion in 2011 . Accordingly , the system of non-automatic import licensing was extended in 2011 , and regulations were enacted for the auto sector establishing a model by which a company 's future imports would be determined by their exports ( though not necessarily in the same rubric ) . </P> <P> A net energy importer until 1987 , Argentina 's fuel exports began increasing rapidly in the early 1990s and today account for about an eighth of the total ; refined fuels make up about half of that . Exports of crude petroleum and natural gas have recently been around US $3 billion a year . Rapidly growing domestic energy demand and a gradual decline in oil production , resulted in a US $3 billion energy trade deficit in 2011 ( the first in 17 years ) and a US $6 billion energy deficit in 2013 . </P> <P> Argentine imports have historically been dominated by the need for industrial and technological supplies , machinery , and parts , which have averaged US $50 billion since 2011 ( two - thirds of total imports ) . Consumer goods including motor vehicles make up most of the rest . Trade in services has historically in deficit for Argentina , and in 2013 this deficit widened to over US $4 billion with a record US $19 billion in service imports . The nation 's chronic current account deficit was reversed during the 2002 crisis , and an average current account surplus of US $7 billion was logged between 2002 and 2009 ; this surplus later narrowed considerably , and has been slightly negative since 2011 . </P> <H2> Foreign investment ( edit ) </H2> <P> Foreign direct investment in Argentina is divided nearly evenly between manufacturing ( 36 % ) , natural resources ( 34 % ) , and services ( 30 % ) . The chemical and plastics sector ( 10 % ) and the automotive sector ( 6 % ) lead foreign investment in local manufacturing ; oil and gas ( 22 % ) and mining ( 5 % ) , in natural resources ; telecommunications ( 6 % ) , finance ( 5 % ) , and retail trade ( 4 % ) , in services . Spain was the leading source of foreign direct investment in Argentina , accounting for US $22 billion ( 28 % ) in 2009 ; the U.S. was the second leading source , with $13 billion ( 17 % ) ; and China grew to become the third - largest source of FDI by 2011 . Investments from the Netherlands , Brazil , Chile , and Canada have also been significant ; in 2012 , foreign nationals held a total of around US $112 billion in direct investment . </P> <P> Several bilateral agreements play an important role in promoting U.S. private investment . Argentina has an Overseas Private Investment Corporation ( OPIC ) agreement and an active program with the U.S. Export - Import Bank . Under the 1994 U.S. -- Argentina Bilateral Investment Treaty , U.S. investors enjoy national treatment in all sectors except shipbuilding , fishing , nuclear - power generation , and uranium production . The treaty allows for international arbitration of investment disputes . </P> <P> Foreign direct investment ( FDI ) in Argentina , which averaged US $5.7 billion from 1992 to 1998 and reached in US $24 billion in 1999 ( reflecting the purchase of 98 % of YPF stock by Repsol ) , fell during the crisis to US $1.6 billion in 2003 . FDI then accelerated , reaching US $8 billion in 2008 . The global crisis cut this figure to US $4 billion in 2009 ; but inflows recovered to US $6.2 billion in 2010 . and US $8.7 billion in 2011 , with FDI in the first half of 2012 up by a further 42 % . </P> <P> FDI volume remained below the regional average as a percent of GDP even as it recovered , however ; Kirchner Administration policies and difficulty in enforcing contractual obligations had been blamed for this modest performance . The nature of foreign investment in Argentina nevertheless shifted significantly after 2000 , and whereas over half of FDI during the 1990s consisted in privatizations and mergers and acquisitions , foreign investment in Argentina became the most technologically oriented in the region -- with 51 % of FDI in the form of medium and high - tech investment ( compared to 36 % in Brazil and 3 % in Chile ) . </P> <H2> Issues ( edit ) </H2> The economic performance of Argentina ( 100 = Latin American average GDP per capita PPP ) <P> The economy recovered strongly from the 2001 -- 02 crisis , and was the 21st largest in purchasing power parity terms in 2011 ; its per capita income on a purchasing power basis was the highest in Latin America . A lobby representing US creditors who refused to accept Argentina 's debt - swap programmes has campaigned to have the country expelled from the G20 . These holdouts include numerous vulture funds which had rejected the 2005 offer , and had instead resorted to the courts in a bid for higher returns on their defaulted bonds . These disputes had led to a number of liens against central bank accounts in New York and , indirectly , to reduced Argentine access to international credit markets . </P> <P> The government under President Mauricio Macri announced to be seeking a new loan from the IMF in order to avoid another economic crash similar to the one in 2001 . The May 2018 announcement comes at a time of high inflation and falling interest rates . The loan would reportedly be worth $30 billion . </P> <P> Following 25 years of boom and bust stagnation , Argentina 's economy doubled in size from 2002 to 2013 , and officially , income poverty declined from 54 % in 2002 to 5 % by 2013 ; an alternative measurement conducted by CONICET found that income poverty declined instead to 15.4 % . Poverty measured by living conditions improved more slowly , however , decreasing from 17.7 % in the 2001 Census to 12.5 % in the 2010 Census . Argentina 's unemployment rate similarly declined from 25 % in 2002 to an average of around 7 % since 2011 largely because of both growing global demand for Argentine commodities and strong growth in domestic activity . </P> <P> Given its ongoing dispute with holdout bondholders , the government has become wary of sending assets to foreign countries ( such as the presidential plane , or artworks sent to foreign exhibitions ) in case they might be impounded by courts at the behest of holdouts . </P> <P> The government has been accused of manipulating economic statistics . </P> <H3> Reliability of official CPI estimates ( edit ) </H3> <P> Official CPI inflation figures released monthly by INDEC have been a subject of political controversy since 2007 . Official inflation data are disregarded by leading union leaders , even in the people sector , when negotiating pay rises . Some private - sector estimates put inflation for 2010 at around 25 % , much higher than the official 10.9 % rate for 2010 . Inflation estimates from Argentina 's provinces are also higher than the government 's figures . The government stands by the validity of its data , but has called in the International Monetary Fund to help it design a new nationwide index to replace the current one . </P> <P> The official government CPI is calculated based on 520 products , however the controversy arises from these products not being specified , and thus how many of those products are subject to price caps and subsidies . Economic analysts have been prosecuted for publishing estimates that disagree with official statistics . The government enforces a fine of up to 500,000 pesos for providing what it calls `` fraudulent inflation figures '' , . Beginning in 2015 , the government again began to call for competitive bids from the private sector to provide a weekly independent inflation index . </P> <H3> Inflation ( edit ) </H3> <P> High inflation has been a weakness of the Argentine economy for decades . Inflation has been unofficially estimated to be running at around 25 % annually since 2008 , despite official statistics indicating less than half that figure ; these would be the highest levels since the 2002 devaluation . A committee was established in 2010 in the Argentine Chamber of Deputies by opposition Deputies Patricia Bullrich , Ricardo Gil Lavedra , and others to publish an alternative index based on private estimates . Food price increases , particularly that of beef , began to outstrip wage increases in 2010 , leading Argentines to decrease beef consumption per capita from 69 kg ( 152 lb ) to 57 kg ( 125 lb ) annually and to increase consumption of other meats . </P> <P> Consumer inflation expectations of 28 to 30 % led the national mint to buy banknotes of its highest denomination ( 100 pesos ) from Brazil at the end of 2010 to keep up with demand . The central bank pumped at least 1 billion pesos into the economy in this way during 2011 . </P> <P> As of June 2015 , the government said that inflation was at 15.3 % ; approximately half that of some independent estimates . Inflation remained at around 18.6 % in 2015 according to an IMF estimate ; but following a sharp devaluation enacted by the Mauricio Macri administration on December 17 , inflation reignited during the first half of 2016 - reaching 42 % according to the Finance Ministry . </P> <P> Supermarkets in Argentina have adopted electronic price tags , allowing prices to be updated quicker . </P> <H3> Income distribution ( edit ) </H3> <P> In relation to other Latin American countries , has a moderate to low level of income inequality . Its Gini coefficient of about 0.427 ( 2014 ) is reported to be the lowest among Latin American countries . The social gap is worst in the suburbs of the capital , where beneficiaries of the economic rebound live in gated communities , and many of the poor ( particularly undocumented immigrants ) live in slums known as villas miserias . </P> <P> In the mid-1970s , the most affluent 10 % of Argentina 's population had an income 12 times that of the poorest 10 % . That figure had grown to 18 times by the mid-1990s , and by 2002 , the peak of the crisis , the income of the richest segment of the population was 43 times that of the poorest . These heightened levels of inequality had improved to 26 times by 2006 , and to 16 times at the end of 2010 . Economic recovery after 2002 was thus accompanied by significant improvement in income distribution : in 2002 , the richest 10 % absorbed 40 % of all income , compared to 1.1 % for the poorest 10 % ; by 2010 , the former received 29 % of income , and the latter , 1.8 % . </P> <P> Argentina has an inequality - adjusted human development index of 0.680 , compared to 0.542 and 0.661 for neighboring Brazil and Chile , respectively . The 2010 Census found that poverty by living conditions still affect 1 in 8 inhabitants , however ; and while the official , household survey income poverty rate ( based on U $ S 100 per person per month , net ) was 4.7 % in 2013 , the National Research Council estimated income poverty in 2010 at 22.6 % , with private consulting firms estimating that in 2011 around 21 % fell below the income poverty line . The World Bank estimated that , in 2013 , 3.6 % subsisted on less than US $3.10 per person per day . </P> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> List of Latin American and Caribbean countries by GDP growth </Li> <Li> List of Latin American and Caribbean countries by GDP ( nominal ) </Li> <Li> List of Latin American and Caribbean countries by GDP ( PPP ) </Li> </Ul> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> ^ Jump up to : `` Argentina '' .
