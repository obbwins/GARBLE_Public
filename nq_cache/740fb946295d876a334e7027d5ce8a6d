Twenty - six years later on the planet Morag , Quill steals an orb but is attacked by Korath , a subordinate to the fanatical Kree , Ronan . Although Quill escapes with the orb , Yondu discovers his theft and issues a bounty for his capture , while Ronan sends the assassin Gamora after the orb . </P> <P> When Quill attempts to sell the orb on Xandar , capital of the Nova Empire , Gamora ambushes him and steals it . A fight ensues , drawing in a pair of bounty hunters : the genetically and cybernetically modified raccoon Rocket , and the tree - like humanoid Groot . Nova Corps officers capture the four , detaining them in the Kyln . A powerful inmate there , Drax , attempts to kill Gamora due to her association with Ronan , who killed his family . Quill convinces Drax that Gamora can bring Ronan to him , though Gamora reveals that she has betrayed Ronan , unwilling to let him use the orb 's power . Learning that Gamora has a buyer for the orb , Quill , Rocket , Groot , and Drax work with her to escape the Kyln in Quill 's ship , the Milano . </P> <P> Ronan meets with Gamora 's adoptive father , Thanos , to discuss her betrayal . Quill 's group flee to Knowhere , a remote criminal outpost in space built in the giant severed head of a Celestial . A drunken Drax summons Ronan while the rest of the group meet Gamora 's contact , the collector Taneleer Tivan . Tivan opens the orb , revealing an Infinity Stone , an item of immeasurable power that destroys all but the most powerful beings who wield it . Tivan 's tormented assistant Carina grabs the Stone , triggering an explosion that engulfs Tivan 's archive . </P> <P> Ronan arrives and easily defeats Drax , while the others flee by ship , pursued by Ronan 's followers and Gamora 's adoptive sister Nebula . Nebula destroys Gamora 's ship , leaving her floating in space , and Ronan 's fighters capture the orb . Quill contacts Yondu before following Gamora into space , giving her his helmet to survive ; Yondu arrives and retrieves the pair . Rocket , Drax , and Groot threaten to attack Yondu 's ship to rescue them , but Quill negotiates a truce , promising the orb to Yondu . Quill 's group agrees that facing Ronan means certain death , but that they can not let him use the Infinity Stone to destroy the galaxy . On Ronan 's flagship , the Dark Aster , Ronan embeds the Stone in his warhammer , taking its power for himself . He contacts Thanos , threatening to kill him after first destroying Xandar ; hateful of her adoptive father , Nebula allies with Ronan . </P> <P> The Ravagers and Quill 's group join with the Nova Corps to confront the Dark Aster at Xandar , with Quill 's group breaching the Dark Aster with the Milano . Ronan uses his empowered warhammer to destroy the Nova Corps fleet . Gamora fights and defeats Nebula , who then escapes , but the group find themselves outmatched by Ronan 's power until Rocket crashes a Ravager ship through the Dark Aster . The damaged Dark Aster crash - lands on Xandar , with Groot sacrificing himself to shield the group . Ronan emerges from the wreck and prepares to destroy Xandar , but Quill distracts him , allowing Drax and Rocket to destroy Ronan 's warhammer . Quill grabs the freed Stone , and with Gamora , Drax , and Rocket sharing its burden , they use it to destroy Ronan . </P> <P> In the aftermath , Quill tricks Yondu into taking a container supposedly containing the Stone , and gives the real Stone to the Nova Corps . As the Ravagers leave Xandar , Yondu remarks that it turned out well that they did not deliver Quill to his father per their contract . Quill 's group , now known as the Guardians of the Galaxy , have their criminal records expunged , and Quill learns that he is only half - human , his father being part of an ancient , unknown species . Quill finally opens the last present he received from his mother : a cassette tape filled with her favorite songs . The Guardians leave in the rebuilt Milano along with a sapling cut from Groot . </P> <P> In a post-credits scene , Tivan sits in his destroyed archive with two of his living exhibits : a canine cosmonaut and an anthropomorphic duck . </P> <H2> Cast ( edit ) </H2> The cast of Guardians of the Galaxy promoting the film at the 2013 San Diego Comic - Con International . From top to bottom : Pratt , Saldana , Bautista , Pace , Rooker , Gillan , Hounsou , and del Toro . ( Scrollable image ) <Ul> <Li> Chris Pratt as Peter Quill / Star - Lord : The half - human , half - alien leader of the Guardians who was abducted from Missouri as a child in 1988 and raised by a group of alien thieves and smugglers called the Ravagers . About the character , Pratt said , `` He had a hard time as a kid , and now he goes around space , making out with hot alien girls and just being a rogue and a bit of a jerk , and through teaming up with these guys , finds a higher purpose for himself . '' He also added that the character is a mix of Han Solo and Marty McFly . Pratt , who was mostly known for playing supporting characters , including Andy Dwyer on the television series Parks and Recreation , initially turned down the role . Pratt had lost weight to portray fit characters in films such as Moneyball and Zero Dark Thirty , and had given up ambitions to play the lead role in action films after humbling auditions for Star Trek and Avatar . Casting director Sarah Finn suggested Pratt to Gunn , who dismissed the idea despite struggling to cast that role . Despite this , Finn arranged for a meeting between the two , at which point Gunn was immediately convinced that Pratt was perfect for the role . Pratt also won over Feige , despite having gained weight again for Delivery Man . Prior to filming , Pratt underwent a strict diet and training regimen to lose 60 lb ( 27 kg ) in six months . Pratt signed a multi-film contract with Marvel , and was granted a temporary leave from his work on Parks and Recreation in order to accommodate his participation in the film . Wyatt Oleff portrays a young Quill . </Li> <Li> Zoe Saldana as Gamora : An orphan from an alien world who seeks redemption for her past crimes . She was trained by Thanos to be his personal assassin . Saldana said that she became Gamora through make - up rather than computer generated imagery ( CGI ) or performance capture . On taking the role , Saldana said , `` I was just excited to be asked to join by James Gunn and to also play someone green . I 've been blue before ( in Avatar ) . '' Saldana described Gamora as `` ... a warrior , she 's an assassin and she 's very lethal but what saves her is the same thing that can doom her . She has a sense of righteousness . She 's a very righteous individual . '' </Li> <Li> Dave Bautista as Drax the Destroyer : A warrior who seeks to avenge his family 's death at the hands of Ronan . On relating to the character , Bautista said , `` I can just relate to Drax so much it 's not even funny . Just the simple things that we have in common . Simple things like the tattoos , the tragedy -- because you know , I had a bit of tragedy in my life as well . So it 's really easy for me to pull from that . '' Bautista also said that there was `` a lot of comic relief to Drax '' , but the character was not aware of it . Bautista stated that he did not do much preparation for the role , because `` Luckily , for me , I 'm a lifelong athlete and I adapted real quick . '' Bautista 's makeup took approximately four hours to apply , though it could be removed in just 90 minutes . Drax has various scarring patterns on his body , which replace the simple tattoos from the comics , each having a specific story . Additionally , his skin tone was changed from the bright green in the comics to a muddier grey , to avoid visual similarities to the Hulk . </Li> <Li> Vin Diesel as Groot : A tree - like humanoid who is the accomplice of Rocket . Diesel stated that he provided the voice and motion capture for Groot , after originally being in talks to star in a new Phase Three Marvel film . Diesel also provided Groot 's voice for several foreign - language releases of the film . Krystian Godlewski portrayed the character on set , though his acting was not used in the final character CGI . On the character , which Gunn based on his dog , Gunn said , `` All the Guardians start out the movie as bastards -- except Groot . He 's an innocent . He 's a hundred percent deadly and a hundred percent sweet . He 's caught up in Rocket 's life , really . '' Gunn added that the design and movement of Groot took `` the better part of a year '' to create . Gunn added , `` The ways in which Vin Diesel says , ' I am Groot , ' I am astounded . All of the ' I am Groots ' that were earlier voices did n't sound very good at all ... Vin came in and in one day , laid down all these ' I am Groot ' tracks , and he 's a perfectionist . He made me explain to him with ever ( sic ) ' I am Groot , ' exactly what he was saying ... It was amazing when we first put that voice in there how much the character changed and how much he influenced the character . '' Regarding the limited words used by Groot , Diesel said in many ways this was , `` ... the most challenging thing to ask an actor to do . '' Diesel found an emotional note in his performance , invoking the death of his friend and Fast and Furious co-star Paul Walker , saying , `` This was in December ( 2013 ) , and the first time I came back to dealing with human beings after dealing with death , so playing a character who celebrates life in the way Groot does was very nice . '' Groot 's form and size - changing abilities are seen , with Gunn stating that he has the ability to grow in the film . </Li> <Li> Bradley Cooper as Rocket : A genetically engineered raccoon - like bounty hunter and mercenary who is a master of weapons and battle tactics . Gunn worked with live raccoons to get the correct feel for the character , and to make sure it was `` not a cartoon character '' , saying , `` It 's not Bugs Bunny in the middle of the Avengers , it 's a real , little , somewhat mangled beast that 's alone . There 's no one else in the universe quite like him , he 's been created by these guys to be a mean - ass fighting machine . '' Gunn also based the character on himself . Describing Rocket in relation to the rest of the Guardians , Cooper said , `` I think Rocket is dynamic . He 's the sort of Joe Pesci in Goodfellas guy . '' Cooper voiced Rocket , while Sean Gunn ( James ' younger brother ) stood in for the character during filming . James Gunn said that for the role of Rocket , some physical movement from Cooper , including facial expressions and hand movements , was recorded as potential reference for the animators , though much of Sean Gunn 's acting is used throughout the film . Before Cooper was cast , James Gunn said that it was a challenge finding a voice for Rocket , that he was looking for someone that could balance `` the fast - talking speech patterns that Rocket has , but also can be funny , because he is really funny . But also has the heart that Rocket has . Because there are actually some pretty dramatic scenes with Rocket . '' </Li> <Li> Lee Pace as Ronan the Accuser : A Kree radical who agrees to retrieve an artifact for Thanos in exchange for eradicating his mortal enemies , the Xandarians . Ronan and his Sakaaran army hunt down the Guardians when they interfere with his goals . Describing Ronan , Gunn said , `` He is the primary villain , and he is a really twisted guy , he has a really religious bent in this film . He has a very sick and twisted view of what morality is ; strength is virtue and weakness is sin and that is what he lives by , and I think he is very scary because of his beliefs , which are real to him . '' Pace , who originally auditioned for Peter Quill , described Ronan as a `` psycho '' and a `` monster '' . </Li> <Li> Michael Rooker as Yondu Udonta : A blue - skinned bandit who is the leader of the Ravagers and a paternal figure to Quill . Yondu helps Quill to steal the orb before Quill betrays him , leaving Yondu and the Ravagers to chase the Guardians . On the character , Rooker said , he has `` some interesting issues -- not a good guy , not a bad guy . There 's hope and there 's a heart inside Yondu . '' Gunn created the film 's version of the character specifically with Rooker in mind , while borrowing the character 's mohawk and use of a whistle - controlled arrow from the comics . Rooker fully committed to the role once he knew his role on the TV series The Walking Dead would be ending . Rooker 's makeup took approximately four hours to apply . </Li> <Li> Karen Gillan as Nebula : An adopted daughter of Thanos who was raised with Gamora as siblings and is a loyal lieutenant in the employ of Ronan and Thanos . About the character , Gillan said , `` She is the female villain of the film ... She is very sadistic and evil , but I like to think for a very valid reason . '' She also added , `` I think she 's a really interesting character . What I like to play around with is how jealous she is . She 's Gamora 's sister , and there 's a lot of sibling rivalry . That 's the most interesting aspect to me , because jealousy can consume you and turn you bitter , and ugly . And she 's a total sadist , so that 's fun too . '' Gillan researched the ancient Spartans , shaved off her hair , and trained for two months for the role . The character 's makeup took approximately four and a half hours to be applied . </Li> <Li> Djimon Hounsou as Korath : A Kree ally of Ronan who is a feared intergalactic hunter . As to why he took the role Hounsou said , `` I have a four - year old son who loves superheroes from Spider - Man to Iron Man to Batman . He 's got all the costumes . One day he looks at me and says ' Dad , I want to be light - skinned so I could be Spider - Man . Spider - Man has light skin . ' That was sort of a shock . This is why I am excited to be a part of the Marvel Universe , so I could hopefully provide that diversity in the role of the superhero . '' </Li> <Li> John C. Reilly as Rhomann Dey : A corpsman in the Nova Corps , the Nova Empire 's military and police force . </Li> <Li> Glenn Close as Irani Rael : The leader of the Nova Corps , known as Nova Prime , whose mission is to protect the citizens of the Nova Empire and keep peace . Close stated that she `` had always wanted to be in a movie like ( Guardians of the Galaxy ) , and that it would be `` the most fun to play something like the Judi Dench ( as M or ) Samuel L. Jackson ( as Nick Fury ) role '' . She said that she took the role because she `` love ( s ) to do stuff that 's different '' and wanted to show that she `` ( has ) always been up for anything . '' She also stated that her contract has `` several '' films on it , and that she would be open to working on other Marvel Studios films in addition to returning for Guardians sequels . </Li> <Li> Benicio del Toro as Taneleer Tivan / The Collector : An obsessive keeper of the largest collection of interstellar fauna , relics , and species in the galaxy who operates out of a place in space named Knowhere . Describing del Toro 's performance , Gunn said , `` He 's like an outer - space Liberace . That 's what it says in the script , which he 's kind of doing . '' On bringing the character to life , del Toro said , `` What James ( Gunn ) wanted , that I found out little by little as I was doing it , is that he wanted me to explore and just keep pushing the character and keep creating ( him ) as I was in front of the camera . '' </Li> </Ul> <P> Additionally , Josh Brolin appears , uncredited , as Thanos through voice acting and performance capture . Sean Gunn stood in for Thanos during filming and portrays Kraglin , Yondu 's first mate in the Ravagers . Alexis Denisof reprises his role as Thanos 's vizier , `` The Other '' , from The Avengers . Ophelia Lovibond plays Carina , the Collector 's slave ; Peter Serafinowicz plays Denarian Garthan Saal , a Nova Corps officer ; Gregg Henry plays Quill 's grandfather ; Laura Haddock plays Quill 's mother , Meredith ; Melia Kreiling plays Bereet ; Christopher Fairbank plays The Broker ; Mikaela Hoover plays Nova Prime 's assistant ; Marama Corlett plays a pit boss at the bar , The Boot ; Emmett J. Scanlan plays a Nova riot guard ; Alexis Rodney plays Moloka Dar ; Tom Proctor plays Horuz , a Ravager ; and Spencer Wilding plays a prison guard who confiscates Quill 's Walkman . Canine actor Fred appears as Cosmo . Stephen Blackehart had a supporting role . Naomi Ryan also had a supporting role in the film , though it was cut in the final version . Cameos in the film include : James Gunn as a Sakaaran ; Stan Lee as a Xandarian Ladies ' Man ; Lloyd Kaufman as an inmate ; Nathan Fillion as the voice of an inmate ; Rob Zombie as the voice of the Ravager Navigator ; composer Tyler Bates as a Ravager pilot ; and Seth Green as the voice of Howard the Duck . </P> <H2> Production ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Development ( edit ) </H3> `` I think anybody ... who would have said that this would make a great main movie would have been laughed off . It 's such an unlikely thing to do . So I think it 's lovely to work on something and expose its potential to the point where a company like Marvel will say , ' Yes , this makes sense . ' '' -- Dan Abnett , co-writer of the 2008 Guardians of the Galaxy relaunch , on the project <P> Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige first mentioned Guardians of the Galaxy as a potential film at the 2010 San Diego Comic - Con International , stating , `` There are some obscure titles , too , like Guardians of the Galaxy . I think they 've been revamped recently in a fun way in the ( comic ) book . '' Feige reiterated that sentiment in a September 2011 issue of Entertainment Weekly , saying , `` There 's an opportunity to do a big space epic , which Thor sort of hints at , in the cosmic side '' of the Marvel Cinematic Universe . Feige added , should the film be made , it would feature an ensemble of characters , similar to X-Men and The Avengers . </P> <P> Feige announced that the film was in active development at the 2012 San Diego Comic - Con International during the Marvel Studios panel , with an intended release date of August 1 , 2014 . He stated that the film 's titular team would consist of the characters Star - Lord , Drax the Destroyer , Gamora , Groot , and Rocket Raccoon . Two pieces of concept art were also displayed , one of Rocket Raccoon , and one featuring the entire team . In August 2012 , James Gunn entered talks to direct the film , beating out other contenders , including Peyton Reed and the duo Ryan Fleck and Anna Boden . The Avengers director Joss Whedon , who signed a deal to creatively consult on all of the films leading up to The Avengers sequel , was enthusiastic about the selection of Gunn to direct , saying `` James ( Gunn ) is what makes me think it will work ... He is so off the wall , and so crazy , but so smart , such a craftsman and he builds from his heart . He loves the raccoon . Needs the raccoon ... He has a very twisted take on it , but it all comes from a real love for the material . It 's going to be hard for ( the human characters ) to keep up . '' </P> Writing ( edit ) <P> Nicole Perlman , who was enrolled in Marvel 's screenwriting program in 2009 , was offered several of their lesser known properties to base a screenplay on . Out of those , Perlman chose Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning 's Guardians of the Galaxy , due to her interest in space and science fiction , adding , `` I think ( Marvel ) were a little taken aback when I chose Guardians , because there were ones that would make a lot more sense if you were a romantic - comedy writer or something like that . '' Perlman spent two years writing a draft , immersing herself in the Guardians universe , and was asked in late 2011 to create another draft , before Gunn was brought in in early 2012 to contribute to the script . Gunn eventually rewrote the script entirely because `` it did n't work '' for him ; he would use the film The Dirty Dozen as a reference to convey his ideas of the film to Marvel . Gunn later explained that Perlman 's draft was very different from the script he used during filming , including a different story , character arcs and no Walkman ; he stated , `` In Nicole 's script everything is pretty different ... it 's not about the same stuff . But that 's how the WGA works . They like first writers an awful lot . '' In August 2012 , Marvel Studios hired writer Chris McCoy to rewrite Perlman 's script , however , it is unclear what contribution he had to the final script , since he did not receive production credit . </P> <P> Gunn revealed that character introductions were the `` hardest scenes to crack '' , with Thanos ' introduction being the most difficult . He felt that `` having Thanos be in that scene was more helpful to the ( MCU ) than it was to Guardians of the Galaxy , '' yet he still wanted Thanos in the film , without `` ( belittling ) the actual antagonist of the film , which is Ronan . '' To solve his dilemma , Gunn chose to have Ronan kill `` The Other '' , Thanos ' vizier , saying , `` I thought that was interesting , because we 've had the Other , who 's obviously very powerful even in comparison to Loki , and then we see Ronan wipe his ass with him . So that I liked , but even that was sort of difficult , because it played as funnier when I first wrote it , and the humor did n't work so much . '' </P> <H3> Pre-production ( edit ) </H3> <P> In September 2012 , Gunn confirmed that he had signed on to direct the film and rewrite the script . By the end of November , Joel Edgerton , Jack Huston , Jim Sturgess , and Eddie Redmayne signed deals to test for the role of Peter Quill , as did Lee Pace , which he confirmed a week later in early December . Other actors who were considered for the role included Thor : The Dark World 's Zachary Levi , Joseph Gordon - Levitt , Michael Rosenbaum , and John Gallagher Jr . Chris Pratt was cast in the role in February 2013 , as part of a multi-film deal that he signed with Marvel . </P> Gunn promoting the film at 2013 San Diego Comic - Con International <P> In January 2013 , filming was scheduled to take place at Shepperton Studios in London , United Kingdom , and Marvel Studios announced that the film would be released in 3D . Victoria Alonso , an executive producer on the film , said that filming would begin in June . She also said that both Rocket Raccoon and Groot would be created through a combination of CGI and motion capture , going on to say that `` You ca n't do any motion capture with a raccoon -- they wo n't let you put the suit on . But we will do rotomation , probably , for some of the behavior ... we definitely will have performers to emulate what James Gunn will lead to be , the behavior and the performance . He 's very clear on where he wants to take the characters . '' In March 2013 , Feige discussed Guardians of the Galaxy in relation to the Marvel Cinematic Universe , saying , `` It 's much more of a standalone film . It takes place in the same universe . And when we 've been on the other side of that universe in other movies , you might see those characteristics in Guardians , but the Avengers are not involved with what 's happening out there at this time . '' Feige also stated that 95 % of the film would take place in space . In mid-March , Dave Bautista was signed to play Drax the Destroyer . Other actors who had been considered for the role included Isaiah Mustafa , Brian Patrick Wade and Jason Momoa . By the following week , sculptor Brian Muir , who sculpted Darth Vader 's mask for the Star Wars films , was revealed to be working on the film . </P> <P> In early April 2013 , Zoe Saldana entered into negotiations to star as Gamora in the film , and it was confirmed she had been cast later that month . Also in April , Michael Rooker joined the film 's cast as Yondu , and it was announced that Ophelia Lovibond had been cast in a supporting role . By this point in time , Lee Pace was in final negotiations to play the villain of the film . In May , Marvel offered John C. Reilly the role of Rhomann Dey . At the same time , it was disclosed that filmmakers were looking at actors including Hugh Laurie , Alan Rickman , and Ken Watanabe , for another role , and that Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely were providing finishing touches to the script . A few days later , Glenn Close was cast as the head of the Nova Corps in the film , followed shortly by the casting of Karen Gillan as the film 's lead female villain . By June 2013 , Benicio del Toro was cast in the film , as part of a multi-film deal with Marvel Studios . Later in the month , it was confirmed that Reilly had been cast as Rhomann Dey . </P> <P> Special effects makeup designer David White took head and body casts of actors , such as Bautista , to experiment with materials used to create the characters . White said , `` James always pushed for practical and makeup effects . He wanted , like me , to see the real deal there on set . '' White was careful not to use `` modern '' creature designs to ensure they did not fall short in Gunn 's uniquely envisioned world . White and his team created upwards of 1,000 prosthetic makeup applications and 2,000 molds of different colored aliens . For the specific aesthetic look to the film , Gunn wanted to create `` a colorful science - fiction world '' , and include elements of 1950s and 60s pulp movies , citing the Ravagers ' spaceships , which he compared to muscle cars , as an example of the latter . Science fiction artist Chris Foss inspired and helped design the final look of some of the spacecrafts that appear in the film . </P> <H3> Filming ( edit ) </H3> <P> Principal photography began around July 6 , 2013 in London , United Kingdom , under the working title of Full Tilt . Filming took place at Shepperton Studios and Longcross Studios . Later in July , Gunn and the film 's cast flew from London to attend San Diego Comic - Con International , where it was revealed that Pace would play Ronan the Accuser , Gillan would be Nebula , del Toro as The Collector , and that Djimon Hounsou had been cast as Korath . Close was later revealed to play Nova Prime Irani Rael . Also at San Diego Comic - Con , Feige stated that Thanos would be a part of the film as the `` mastermind '' . On August 11 , 2013 , filming began at London 's Millennium Bridge , which was selected as a double for Xandar . In August 2013 , Marvel announced that Bradley Cooper would voice Rocket . On September 3 , 2013 , Gunn said that filming was `` a little over half ( way ) '' complete . Also in September , Vin Diesel stated that he was voicing Groot . However , Marvel did not confirm Diesel 's involvement in the film at the time . On October 12 , 2013 , Gunn announced on social media that filming had completed . </P> <P> Director of photography Ben Davis used Arri Alexa XT cameras for the film , saying , `` I 'm traditionally a photochemical fan , but going with the digital format was the right way for this movie ... the Alexa ( provided ) the right look for this particular film . '' During the opening scenes in the 1980s , Davis chose JDC Cooke Xtal ( Crystal ) Express anamorphic prime lenses because they `` had more anamorphic artifacts and aberrations , which ( he ) felt added something . '' Davis used spherical Panavision Primos for the rest of the film . Additionally , Davis worked closely with production designer Charles Wood in order to achieve the correct lighting looks for each scene . Dealing with two fully CGI characters forced Davis to shoot scenes multiple times , usually once with the references for the characters and once without them in the shot . </P> <P> Gunn revealed that his brother , Sean Gunn , took on multiple roles during the filming process , such as standing in for Rocket , which he noted was beneficial for the other actors , including Saldana , Pratt , and Bautista , who responded positively to Sean and his on - set performances . Special effects makeup designer David White made two life - size versions of Rocket and a bust of Groot as aids for visual effects , with White saying , `` it gives ( the filmmakers ) a good indication of where visual effects needs to pick up and whether Rocket can actually reach certain things or use certain devices . '' These busts were also used to see how the on - set lighting would affect the characters , to assist with the visual effects lighting process . </P> <P> In January 2015 , Disney revealed that the film came in `` slightly over the agreed budget '' at $232.3 million , with Disney receiving a rebate of $36.4 million from the British government . It was previously estimated to have had a $170 million budget . </P> <H3> Post-production ( edit ) </H3> <P> In November 2013 , Gunn stated that he attempted to use as many practical effects as possible while filming to aid the use of CGI and motion capture during post-production , saying , `` Our sets are enormous . We have a prison that is 350,000 pounds of steel . Anybody who knows me knows I love the mix of practical and CGI effects ... I ca n't wait for people to see it , because it 's astonishingly beautiful . '' After the release of Thor : The Dark World , Feige stated that the Infinity Stones would be a focus in the film , as well as going forward into the Phase Three slate of films within the MCU . In a separate interview for The Dark World in November , Feige added that a third , unknown Infinity Stone would be seen in the film , referred to as the `` Power Stone '' by the Collector . The mid-credits scene in The Dark World revealed Lovibond 's role as the Collector 's aide , later named Carina . In December 2013 , Marvel confirmed that Diesel would voice Groot . </P> <P> A few weeks of additional filming , involving the film 's main cast and crew , occurred in March 2014 at Walt Disney Studios in Burbank , California . In April 2014 , Gunn described Thanos as the `` head of the snake '' in the film , and confirmed he would appear via performance capture . In May 2014 , Gunn stated that the film features an `` enormous '' amount of smaller and minor characters from the Marvel Universe , adding that he felt the film had the most characters overall of any Marvel Studios film to date . Costume supervisor Dan Grace added to this by saying , `` We really , really get the feeling of the scale and scope of the galaxy . We visit five planets , we see a hundred different races . '' The film introduces the alien race Sakaaran , who act as Ronan 's mercenaries , as a replacement to the Badoon , as the Badoon film rights belonged to 20th Century Fox . </P> <P> By the end of May , Josh Brolin was revealed as the voice of Thanos , with Feige confirming in July that Brolin also provided the performance capture for the character . Thanos communicates via hologram for much of the film , though he does appear in a scene with Ronan and Nebula . In June 2014 , Feige added that Thanos and his followers are `` the biggest piece of connective tissue that will eventually lead us back into Avengers films in the future . '' On casting Brolin , Feige said , </P> <P> We reached out to him and it was one of those things that does not happen all the time but when it does it 's very nice , where he was totally intrigued . He was a fan of what we did , he met with Jeremy Latcham in a hotel in London and learned about the characters a little bit . I spoke to him on the phone a few times . We ran it by James who loved it , ran it by Joss ( Whedon ) who loved it because Thanos is in this universe because of Avengers . Then we shot him and recorded for it . </P> <P> On July 7 , 2014 , Gunn announced on social media that he had completed work on the film . In August , regarding the post-credit scene , Gunn revealed that the scene did not involve Howard the Duck when it was originally filmed , rather he was added during post-production , a decision made by `` some combination of ( Gunn ) and the editor Fred Raskin '' . As the decision to add the character was made late in the post-production process , he had to be designed that day , before being handed off to Sony Pictures Imageworks to animate . Also in August , regarding the pre-credit scene of Groot dancing , Gunn stated that he himself danced to provide motion reference for the animators , and that the decision was made to place the scene before the credits , rather than during or after them , because of positive responses from a test audience , which made Marvel and Gunn feel that they did not want `` people walking out and missing this thing '' . Marvel used design firm Sarofsky once again for the film 's title sequences , after liking their work for Captain America : The Winter Soldier . Sarofsky developed a custom typeface based on the font used in the teaser posters for the opening credits , which was tinted orange to offer a better contrast to the film 's blue and grey imagery . One of the typography solutions offered before the final product wound up being repurposed as the locator cards seen throughout the film . </P> Visual effects ( edit ) The Gardens by the Bay ( top ) in Singapore helped inspire the look of the planet Xandar ( bottom ) . <P> The film featured 2,750 visual effects shots , which make up approximately 90 % of the film . The visual effects were created by : Moving Picture Company ( MPC ) , who worked on creating Groot , as well as Morag , Xandar , the Dark Aster and the final battle on Xandar ; Framestore , who worked on creating Rocket , extending the Kyln prison set and constructing Knowhere ; Luma Pictures , who worked on Thanos ; Method Studios , who worked on creating the Orb opening and revealing its powers , as well as the holographic displays at the Nova Corps command center ; Lola VFX ; Cantina Creative ; Sony Pictures Imageworks , who worked on Howard the Duck and creating the Dark Aster shots with MPC ; CoSA VFX ; Secret Lab ; Rise Visual Effects Studios ; and Technicolor VFX . Pre - and post-visualizations were done by Proof and The Third Floor , with Proof also contributing to the creation of Rocket and Groot . </P> <P> Producer Nik Korda noted how helpful it was to have Sean Gunn and Krystian Godlewski portray Rocket and Groot on set , as it provided references for lighting and on - set performances to the animators . When creating Groot , MPC realized early on that his eyes would be essential in maintaining the character 's human qualities , as his face could n't move in the way that humans ' do . MPC visual effects supervisor Nicolas Aithadi explained that , `` When you look at humans what makes the eyes interesting is the imperfections -- trying to make these two irises not aimed at the same place -- trying to make them strange and look more human . '' Textures for Groot came from a number of sources , including inspiration from a botanical garden in London , and the character was modeled as individual branches , rigged individually , to simulate a muscle system for the character . </P> <P> One of the major challenges for Framestore in creating Rocket was his fur . Framestore 's Rachel Williams explained that , since `` raccoon fur is made up from a layer of short fine hair and a layer of longer thicker hairs '' , these layers were separated and animated individually , removing the need to use `` guide hairs '' to control the movements of thick sections of fur . Framestore and MPC worked closely sharing assets , to ensure shots of Rocket at MPC would match the Rocket created by Framestore , and vice versa for when Groot was needed by the other studio . </P> <P> In order to give Thanos `` the performance and the weight that he deserved '' , Luma Pictures created a new facial animation system to re-create Josh Brolin as a fully CG character , using his `` eyes , some of his cheek , how his muscles move when he talks '' . The character 's large jaw , and the deep groves that run down his face , had `` to be carefully planned out with the movement of his face . '' </P> <H2> Music ( edit ) </H2> Main article : Guardians of the Galaxy ( soundtrack ) <P> In August 2013 , Gunn revealed that Tyler Bates would be composing the film 's score . Gunn stated that Bates would write some of the score first so that he can film to the music , as opposed to scoring to the film . In February 2014 , Gunn revealed that the film would incorporate songs from the 1960s and 1970s , such as `` Hooked on a Feeling '' , on a mixtape in Quill 's Walkman , which acts as a way for him to stay connected to the Earth , home , and family he lost . In May 2014 , Gunn added that using the songs from the 60s and 70s were `` cultural reference points '' , saying , `` It 's striking the balance throughout the whole movie , through something that is very unique , but also something that is easily accessible to people at the same time . The music and the Earth stuff is one of those touchstones that we have to remind us that , yeah , ( Quill ) is a real person from planet Earth who 's just like you and me . Except that he 's in this big outer space adventure . '' </P> <P> When choosing the songs , Gunn revealed he `` started the process by reading the Billboard charts for all of the top hits of the ' 70s '' , downloading `` a few hundred '' songs that were `` semi-familiar -- ones you recognize but might not be able to name off the top of your head '' and creating a playlist for all the songs that would fit the film tonally . He added that he `` would listen to the playlist on my speakers around the house -- sometimes I would be inspired to create a scene around a song , and other times I had a scene that needed music and I would listen through the playlist , visualizing various songs , figuring out which would work the best . '' Most of the songs were played on set to help `` the actors and the camera operators find the perfect groove for the shot '' , with David Bowie 's `` Moonage Daydream '' the only song chosen and added during post-production . Gunn also said that the opening scenes were designed with `` Hooked on a Feeling '' in mind ; however once Gunn discovered `` Come and Get Your Love '' , the song used in the sequence , Gunn felt it was a `` better fit . '' </P> <P> Three albums were released by Hollywood Records on July 29 , 2014 : The film 's score , Guardians of the Galaxy ( Original Score ) , which features the music composed by Bates for the film ; Guardians of the Galaxy : Awesome Mix Vol. 1 ( Original Motion Picture Soundtrack ) , which comprises the twelve songs from Quill 's mixtape ; and a deluxe edition featuring both albums . By August 2014 , the album which mirrored Quill 's mixtape had reached the top of the Billboard 200 chart , becoming the first soundtrack album in history consisting entirely of previously released songs to top the chart . Hollywood Records also released a cassette version of the Awesome Mix Vol. 1 soundtrack on November 28 , 2014 , as an exclusive to Record Store Day participants . The cassette , which is the first cassette Disney Music Group has released since 2003 , comes with a digital download version of the album . </P> <H2> Release ( edit ) </H2> Karen Gillan at the London premiere of Guardians of the Galaxy . <P> The world premiere of Guardians of the Galaxy was held on July 21 , 2014 , at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood . The film was released theatrically in the United Kingdom on July 31 , 2014 , and in the United States on August 1 , in 3D and IMAX 3D . The film was released in 4,080 theaters in the United States , making it the widest August release , breaking the five year record held by G.I. Joe : The Rise of Cobra ( 4,007 theatres ) . The breakdown of venues was : 354 IMAX screens , 3,200 3D screens , 350 large format screens and 240 D - Box screens . In its sixth weekend , Guardians of the Galaxy was playing in 69 territories , its most . </P> <P> In June 2014 , Gunn stated that the film had always been planned as a 3D film , and `` Unlike many directors , I 've been actively involved with converting every shot to 3D , making sure it works perfectly for the story and the film , making sure it 's spectacular and immersive without being silly , distracting , or overly showy . '' Gunn also revealed that the IMAX 3D version would include shifting aspect ratios , to make the viewing experience `` even fuller and more encompassing . I 've personally chosen all the places where the changes occur ... The changing aspect ratios in this case are actually a part of the storytelling . '' In July 2014 , Gunn revealed that there were multiple scenes he had cut from the film , and he was investigating how to release them , either in an extended cut of the film , or as bonus features on the film 's home media release . </P> <H3> Marketing ( edit ) </H3> The cast and crew of Guardians of the Galaxy at the 2013 San Diego Comic - Con International . ( L-R : producer Kevin Feige , Bautista , director James Gunn , del Toro , Saldana , Hounsou , Pace , Rooker , Gillan , and Pratt ) <P> At Disney 's D23 Expo in August 2013 , Feige presented footage first revealed at the San Diego Comic - Con in July 2013 . The first trailer for the film debuted on Jimmy Kimmel Live ! on February 18 , 2014 , with a special introduction by Chris Pratt . The Los Angeles Times said the trailer delivered `` some spirited alien action , with exploding spaceships and muscled bad guys , not to mention a few purely comedic moments , '' while spotlighting `` a number of the offbeat characters . '' Total Film noted the similarity of the trailer 's opening clip to the 1981 film , Raiders of the Lost Ark , which Gunn stated was a big influence for Guardians , and made note of the `` edgy '' humor used throughout . Total Film also noted the similarity of the trailer to the one debuted at Comic - Con and D23 , with a few new shots featuring Nebula and the Collector . Social media response to the trailer was strong , with 88,000 mentions across Twitter , Facebook and various blogs in a 12 - hour period . Those numbers were comparable to trailers for other superhero films like Man of Steel and The Amazing Spider - Man 2 , and noteworthy for the late night time period in which it premiered . The trailer received 22.8 million views in the 24 hours after it debuted . After the debut of the trailer , Blue Swede 's version of `` Hooked on a Feeling '' , which was prominently used throughout the trailer , went up 700 % in sales the following day . The line from Serafinowicz 's character , `` What a bunch of A-holes . '' , was only intended to be featured in the trailers , but due to its positive reception , was included in the final cut of the film . Gunn noted that a different teaser was almost released `` that was very cheesy ( and ) sold the movie as something different than what it was '' , as it tested better than the version that was ultimately released . Gunn credited the marketing teams at Marvel and Disney for having faith in the latter version , despite how it tested , over choosing the version that would have mis - marketed the film . </P> <P> In March 2014 , the Marvel 's Agents of REMOVED_SECRET.REMOVED_SECRET. episode `` REMOVED_SECRET.REMOVED_SECRET. '' introduced the Kree race to the MCU , which began a storyline that recurs throughout the series and involves finding a hidden Kree city . Also in March , ABC aired a one - hour television special titled , Marvel Studios : Assembling a Universe , which included a sneak peek of Guardians of the Galaxy . Starting in April 2014 , a two - part comic was released , titled Marvel 's Guardians of the Galaxy Prelude . Written by Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning , with art by Wellington Alves , the first issue focused on the background of Nebula and her bond with Thanos ; the second issue featured the adventures of Rocket and Groot before they join forces with the other Guardians . In June 2014 , Mike Pasciullo , senior VP of Marvel Studios , described the marketing approach for Guardians of the Galaxy by saying that Marvel had `` built a robust marketing program for the theatrical release that carefully integrates traditional advertising , social media , digital marketing , strategic promotional partnerships , organic entertainment integrations ( and ) publicity . '' </P> <P> In July 2014 , Marvel launched a viral marketing campaign for the film called `` Galaxy Getaways '' , a fictional travel website that allows users to book passage to some of the planets depicted in the film , including Xandar , Morag , and Knowhere . Beginning July 4 , 2014 , a sneak peek of the film was presented at Disneyland and Disney 's Hollywood Studios in the Magic Eye and ABC Sound Studio theaters , respectively . Approximately 14 minutes of the film was screened on July 7 , 2014 , in IMAX 3D in the United States , and 3D theaters and IMAX 3D in Canada , along with two trailers . The screening was met with positive reviews , praising the humor , the 3D and IMAX conversion , and Cooper 's portrayal of Rocket . However , it was criticized for beginning partway through the film , not allowing viewers to easily acclimate to the film 's tone , and for how the general audience might respond to a film within the MCU without established characters making appearances . </P> <P> On July 12 , 2014 , Gunn and the actors from the film promoted Guardians of the Galaxy at the Lido 8 Cineplex in Singapore . On July 17 , 2014 , Disney Interactive released an action RPG video game titled Guardians of the Galaxy : The Universal Weapon for iOS , Android and Windows devices . The game 's original story was written by Dan Abnett , and was meant to complement the film . On July 21 , Pratt , Saldana , Bautista , Diesel and Cooper appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live ! to promote the film and debut some additional exclusive content . On July 29 , Pratt and Saldana rang the opening bell of the New York Stock Exchange as part of the film 's marketing strategy . </P> <P> On August 14 , Marvel released the scene of Groot dancing , which was shortly followed by an announcement from Funko that they were releasing a toy `` Dancing Groot '' . The Hollywood Reporter noted that the quick release of the scene from Marvel two weeks after the film 's theatrical release , along with the rush announcement from Funko , indicated the popularity of both the character and the scene . The scene also produced the word `` grooting '' , coined by Michael Rooker , in which a person dances similar to Groot , with the word entering the social media lexicon . Also in August , Marvel held a special screening of the film at Children 's Hospital Los Angeles , where Pratt dressed as Star - Lord to entertain the patients . </P> Merchandise ( edit ) <P> In June 2012 , Marvel filed eleven trademark applications for Guardians of the Galaxy , covering a variety of consumer products , from video games to cosmetics . Disney Consumer Products partnered with Mad Engine , C - Life , New Era , Hasbro , Disguise , Rubies , Sideshow Collectibles , Lego , KIDdesigns , iHome , Funko , Freeze , Fast Forward , and Innovative Designs to produce merchandise for the film , with releases starting in June 2014 . Mad Engine and C - Life were partnered as the core apparel outfitters , producing a line of T - shirts and fleece jackets , while New Era produced headwear and hats . Hasbro produced toys for the film ; Disguise and Rubies produced the costumes ; and Sideshow Collectibles was given charge of the collectibles . Lego announced three toy sets based on scenes from the film , while iHome created character speakers , Funko made vinyl bobble heads , Freeze crafted 1980s - inspired apparel , and backpacks and stationery were made by Fast Forward and Innovative Designs . Despite first films in a potential new franchise usually being off - limits to licensees , Marvel used Iron Man 's success as evidence of unknown characters becoming hits with audiences to attract partnerships . Licensees embraced Rocket as the film 's potential breakout character , with Drax and Gamora being used for older demographics ; Star - Lord 's obsession with 1980s nostalgia , including his `` Awesome Mix Vo. 1 '' cassette , has also served as a basis for tie - in products . In August 2014 , Funko announced a toy based on `` Dancing Groot '' , while in October 2014 , Marvel and KID designs announced a replica of dancing Groot , for release in December 2014 . </P> <P> In December 2014 , Disney made a second marketing push , to coincide with the film 's home media release with additional merchandise .

Additional partners included Mad Engine , Just Play and Dragon Models . Paul Gitter , senior vice president of Marvel licensing at Disney Consumer Products said , `` The demand for Guardians of the Galaxy merchandise has been truly out of this world . Our merchandising and retail partners are doing a tremendous job of providing creative and innovative ways for fans to continue interacting with these popular characters and showcase their fandom year round . '' </P> <H3> Home media ( edit ) </H3> <P> Guardians of the Galaxy was released for digital download by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment on November 18 , 2014 and on Blu - ray , Blu - ray 3D , and DVD on November 24 , 2014 , in the United Kingdom and on December 9 in the United States .

It was released on December 8 , 2015 . </P> <H2> Reception ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Box Office ( edit ) </H3> <P> Guardians of the Galaxy earned $333.2 million in North America and an estimated $440.2 million in other countries , for a worldwide total of $773.3 million . The film became the third highest - grossing film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe , behind The Avengers and Iron Man 3 . It was the third highest - grossing 2014 film ( behind Transformers : Age of Extinction and The Hobbit : The Battle of the Five Armies ) and the highest - grossing superhero film of 2014 . It had a worldwide opening weekend of $160.7 million . Deadline.com calculated the net profit for the film to be $204.2 million , when factoring together `` production budgets , P&A , talent participations and other costs , with box office grosses , and ancillary revenues from VOD to DVD and TV , '' placing it fifth on their list of 2014 's `` Most Valuable Blockbusters '' . </P> North America ( edit ) <P> Guardians of the Galaxy earned $11.2 million on its Thursday night pre-opening , surpassing Captain America : The Winter Soldier 's gross ( $10.2 million ) for the biggest Thursday evening start for a movie in 2014 . IMAX accounted for 17 % of the total gross ( $1.9 million ) , which was the biggest August pre-release in IMAX format . On its opening day , the film earned $37.8 million , including the Thursday night earnings . Guardians of the Galaxy was the number one movie during its opening weekend and grossed $94.3 million , setting an August weekend record . During the opening weekend , IMAX earnings amounted to $11.7 million and 3 - D showings accounted for 45 % of ticket sales . The film 's success was partially attributed to its appeal to both genders : the opening weekend audience was 44 % female , which is the biggest proportion ever for a MCU film ; 55 % of the opening - weekend audience was over the age of 25 . </P> <P> Although the film fell to second place in its second and third weekends , behind Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles , the film was number one in its fourth , fifth and sixth weekend . By doing so , it became the first film in 2014 to top the domestic box office in non-consecutive weeks , the first film of the summer ( May -- August ) to be the number one film in three weekends and the first MCU film to be the top film for four weeks , surpassing Captain America : The Winter Soldier and The Avengers , both of which were number one for three weeks , and tied The Dark Knight for the most weeks at number one among comic book - based films . Phil Contrino , vice president and chief analyst of BoxOffice.com felt Guardians success was `` unconventional '' and was `` shattering expectations '' . The film remained in the top 10 for ten weekends . </P> <P> The film was the top grossing film of summer 2014 ( ahead of Transformers : Age of Extinction ) , first of 2014 to pass $300 million for its domestic gross , and was the third highest - grossing domestic film of 2014 ( behind American Sniper and The Hunger Games : Mockingjay -- Part 1 ) . The film was said to have `` injected life '' into an otherwise lower than normal summer box office . </P> Outside North America ( edit ) <P> Guardians of the Galaxy was released in 42 international markets and grossed $66.4 million on its opening weekend . The biggest debuts came from Russia ( $13 million ) , the United Kingdom ( $10.8 million ) , Mexico ( $6.5 million ) , Brazil ( $6.5 million ) and South Korea ( $4.7 million ) .

The film 's three biggest markets in total earnings were : China ( $96.5 million ) ; the UK ( $47.4 million ) ; and Russia ( $37.5 million ) . </P> <H3> Critical response ( edit ) </H3> <P> The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 91 % approval rating with an average rating of 7.8 / 10 based on 288 reviews . The website 's consensus reads , `` Guardians of the Galaxy is just as irreverent as fans of the frequently zany Marvel comic would expect -- as well as funny , thrilling , full of heart , and packed with visual splendor . '' Metacritic , which uses a weighted average , assigned a score of 76 out of 100 , based on 52 critics , indicating `` generally favorable reviews '' . CinemaScore audiences gave Guardians of the Galaxy an `` A '' grade rating on an A+ to F scale , while earning an `` A + '' among under - 18 and 25 - to 34 - year - old viewers . </P> <P> Scott Foundas of Variety said `` James Gunn 's presumptive franchise - starter is overlong , overstuffed and sometimes too eager to please , but the cheeky comic tone keeps things buoyant -- as does Chris Pratt 's winning performance '' , and praised the film 's look created by cinematographer Ben Davis , production designer Charles Wood , and special effects makeup designer David White . Justin Lowe of The Hollywood Reporter also praised the film 's look , and felt `` A well - matched ensemble rises to the challenge of launching a heroic origin film with distinctive style , abundant thrills and no shortage of humor . '' The Daily Telegraph 's Robbie Collin said , `` A brand new summer family blockbuster this may be , but it plays by old , half - forgotten rules ; trimming out the clutter and cross-referencing for snappy , streamlined , Saturday - cartoon fun '' . Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times said , `` Blessed with a loose , anarchic B - picture soul that encourages you to enjoy yourself even when you 're not quite sure what 's going on , the scruffy Guardians is irreverent in a way that can bring the first Star Wars to mind , in part because it has some of the most unconventional heroes this side of the Mos Eisley Cantina . '' Manohla Dargis of The New York Times said , `` While Guardians takes you down one after another crazy narrative turn , it also pulls you into -- and , for the most part , keeps you in -- a fully realized other world . '' Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun - Times said , `` Guardians of the Galaxy is a late summer treat -- a mostly lighthearted and self - referential comic - book movie with loads of whiz - bang action , some laugh - out - loud moments and a couple of surprisingly beautiful and touching scenes as well , '' calling it `` a refreshing confection of entertainment . '' Jim Starlin , creator of Drax the Destroyer , Gamora , and Thanos , said it `` might be Marvel 's best movie yet '' . </P> <P> Jake Coyle of the Associated Press was more critical of the film , calling it `` terribly overstuffed and many of the jokes get drowned out by the special effects ... The pervasive movie references detract from the stab at freshness , and Guardians depends all too much on the whimsy of ' 70s anthems for an original beat . '' He also felt that Close , Reilly and del Toro were underused in the film . Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle said , `` In place of wit , Guardians offers a sort of generalized willingness to be amusing , an atmosphere of high spirits that feels like lots of people pumping air into a tire that has a hole in it . Everyone is clearly working , but nothing is really happening -- and yet the effort is so evident that there 's an impulse to reward it . '' Kyle Smith of the New York Post also had a negative response to the film , comparing it to Howard the Duck and Green Lantern , and criticizing the dialogue , villains , soundtrack , lack of suspense , and the characters of Quill , Rocket , and Drax . The film received mixed reviews in China , where viewers complained that the film 's `` poor subtitle translation not only spoiled the fun of watching it , but also made it difficult to understand its humor .
