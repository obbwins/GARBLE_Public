( the nation 's capital ) , and several territories . The federal government is composed of three distinct branches : legislative , executive , and judicial , whose powers are vested by the U.S. Constitution in the Congress , the president , and the federal courts , respectively . The powers and duties of these branches are further defined by acts of Congress , including the creation of executive departments and courts inferior to the Supreme Court . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Naming </Li> <Li> 2 History </Li> <Li> 3 Legislative branch <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Makeup of Congress <Ul> <Li> 3.1. 1 House of Representatives </Li> <Li> 3.1. 2 Senate </Li> <Li> 3.1. 3 Different powers </Li> <Li> 3.1. 4 Impeachment of federal officers </Li> <Li> 3.1. 5 Congressional procedures </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3.2 Powers of Congress <Ul> <Li> 3.2. 1 Congressional oversight </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Executive branch <Ul> <Li> 4.1 President </Li> <Li> 4.2 Vice president </Li> <Li> 4.3 Cabinet , executive departments , and agencies </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 5 Judicial branch <Ul> <Li> 5.1 Overview of the federal judiciary </Li> <Li> 5.2 Relationships between state and federal courts </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 6 Elections and voting </Li> <Li> 7 State , tribal , and local governments </Li> <Li> 8 See also </Li> <Li> 9 References </Li> <Li> 10 Bibliography </Li> <Li> 11 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Naming </H2> Political system of the United States <P> The full name of the republic is `` United States of America '' . No other name appears in the Constitution , and this is the name that appears on money , in treaties , and in legal cases to which it is a party ( Charles T. Schenck v. United States ) . The terms `` Government of the United States of America '' or `` United States Government '' are often used in official documents to represent the federal government as distinct from the states collectively . In casual conversation or writing , the term `` Federal Government '' is often used , and the term `` National Government '' is sometimes used . The terms `` Federal '' and `` National '' in government agency or program names generally indicate affiliation with the federal government ( Federal Bureau of Investigation , National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , National Park Service ) . Because the seat of government is in Washington , D.C. , `` Washington '' is commonly used as a metonym for the federal government . </P> <H2> History </H2> <P> The outline of the government of the United States is laid out in the Constitution . The government was formed in 1789 , when the Constitution went into effect , making the United States one of the world 's first , if not the first , modern national constitutional republics . </P> <P> The United States government is based on the principles of federalism and republicanism , in which power is shared between the federal government and state governments . The interpretation and execution of these principles , including what powers the federal government should have and how those powers can be exercised , have been debated ever since the adoption of the Constitution . Some make the case for expansive federal powers while others argue for a more limited role for the central government in relation to individuals , the states , or other recognized entities . </P> <P> Since the American Civil War , the powers of the federal government have generally expanded greatly , although there have been periods since that time of legislative branch dominance ( e.g. , the decades immediately following the Civil War ) or when states ' rights proponents have succeeded in limiting federal power through legislative action , executive prerogative or by constitutional interpretation by the courts . </P> <P> One of the theoretical pillars of the U.S. Constitution is the idea of `` checks and balances '' among the powers and responsibilities of the three branches of American government : the executive , the legislative , and the judiciary . For example , while the legislative branch ( Congress ) has the power to create law , the executive branch under the president can veto any legislation -- an act which , in turn , can be overridden by Congress . The president nominates judges to the nation 's highest judiciary authority , the Supreme Court , but those nominees must be approved by Congress . The Supreme Court , in turn , can invalidate unconstitutional laws passed by the Congress . These and other examples are examined in more detail in the text below . </P> <H2> Legislative branch </H2> Main article : United States Congress Seal of the U.S. Congress <P> The United States Congress is the legislative branch of the federal government . It is bicameral , comprising the House of Representatives and the Senate . </P> <H3> Makeup of Congress </H3> House of Representatives The 435 seats of the House grouped by state <P> The House currently consists of 435 voting members , each of whom represents a congressional district . The number of representatives each state has in the House is based on each state 's population as determined in the most recent United States Census . All 435 representatives serve a two - year term . Each state receives a minimum of one representative in the House . In order to be elected as a representative , an individual must be at least 25 years of age , must have been a U.S. citizen for at least seven years , and must live in the state that he or she represents . There is no limit on the number of terms a representative may serve . In addition to the 435 voting members , there are 6 non-voting members , consisting of 5 delegates and one resident commissioner . There is one delegate each from the District of Columbia , Guam , the Virgin Islands , American Samoa , and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands , and the resident commissioner from Puerto Rico . </P> Senate <P> In contrast , the Senate is made up of two senators from each state , regardless of population . There are currently 100 senators ( 2 from each of the 50 states ) , who each serve six - year terms . Approximately one - third of the Senate stands for election every two years . </P> Different powers <P> The House and Senate each have particular exclusive powers . For example , the Senate must approve ( give `` advice and consent '' to ) many important presidential appointments , including cabinet officers , federal judges ( including nominees to the Supreme Court ) , department secretaries ( heads of federal executive branch departments ) , U.S. military and naval officers , and ambassadors to foreign countries . All legislative bills for raising revenue must originate in the House of Representatives . The approval of both chambers is required to pass all legislation , which then may only become law by being signed by the president ( or , if the president vetoes the bill , both houses of Congress then re-pass the bill , but by a two - thirds majority of each chamber , in which case the bill becomes law without the president 's signature ) . The powers of Congress are limited to those enumerated in the Constitution ; all other powers are reserved to the states and the people . The Constitution also includes the `` Necessary and Proper Clause '' , which grants Congress the power to `` make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers '' . Members of the House and Senate are elected by first - past - the - post voting in every state except Louisiana and Georgia , which have runoffs . </P> Impeachment of federal officers Main article : Impeachment in the United States <P> Congress has the power to remove the president , federal judges , and other federal officers from office . The House of Representatives and Senate have separate roles in this process . The House must first vote to `` impeach '' the official . Then , a trial is held in the Senate to decide whether the official should be removed from office . Although two presidents have been impeached by the House of Representatives ( Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton ) , neither of them was removed following trial in the Senate . </P> Congressional procedures <P> Article I , Section 2 , paragraph 2 of the U.S. Constitution gives each chamber the power to `` determine the rules of its proceedings '' . From this provision were created congressional committees , which do the work of drafting legislation and conducting congressional investigations into national matters . The 108th Congress ( 2003 -- 2005 ) had 19 standing committees in the House and 17 in the Senate , plus 4 joint permanent committees with members from both houses overseeing the Library of Congress , printing , taxation , and the economy . In addition , each house may name special , or select , committees to study specific problems . Today , much of the congressional workload is borne by the subcommittees , of which there are around 150 . </P> <H3> Powers of Congress </H3> Main article : Article One of the United States Constitution The United States Capitol is the seat of government for Congress . <P> The Constitution grants numerous powers to Congress . Enumerated in Article I , Section 8 , these include the powers to levy and collect taxes ; to coin money and regulate its value ; provide for punishment for counterfeiting ; establish post offices and roads , issue patents , create federal courts inferior to the Supreme Court , combat piracies and felonies , declare war , raise and support armies , provide and maintain a navy , make rules for the regulation of land and naval forces , provide for , arm and discipline the militia , exercise exclusive legislation in the District of Columbia , and to make laws necessary to properly execute powers . Over the two centuries since the United States was formed , many disputes have arisen over the limits on the powers of the federal government . These disputes have often been the subject of lawsuits that have ultimately been decided by the United States Supreme Court . </P> Congressional oversight Main article : Congressional oversight <P> Congressional oversight is intended to prevent waste and fraud , protect civil liberties and individual rights , ensure executive compliance with the law , gather information for making laws and educating the public , and evaluate executive performance . </P> <P> It applies to cabinet departments , executive agencies , regulatory commissions , and the presidency . </P> <P> Congress 's oversight function takes many forms : </P> <Ul> <Li> Committee inquiries and hearings </Li> <Li> Formal consultations with and reports from the president </Li> <Li> Senate advice and consent for presidential nominations and for treaties </Li> <Li> House impeachment proceedings and subsequent Senate trials </Li> <Li> House and Senate proceedings under the 25th Amendment in the event that the president becomes disabled or the office of the vice president falls vacant </Li> <Li> Informal meetings between legislators and executive officials </Li> <Li> Congressional membership : each state is allocated a number of seats based on its representation ( or ostensible representation , in the case of D.C. ) in the House of Representatives . Each state is allocated two senators regardless of its population . As of January 2010 , the District of Columbia elects a non-voting representative to the House of Representatives along with American Samoa , the U.S. Virgin Islands , Guam , Puerto Rico , and the Northern Mariana Islands . </Li> </Ul> <H2> Executive branch </H2> See also : Article Two of the United States Constitution and List of United States federal executive orders <P> The executive power in the federal government is vested in the President of the United States , although power is often delegated to the Cabinet members and other officials . The president and vice president are elected as running mates by the Electoral College , for which each state , as well as the District of Columbia , is allocated a number of seats based on its representation ( or ostensible representation , in the case of D.C. ) in both houses of Congress . The president is limited to a maximum of two four - year terms . If the president has already served two years or more of a term to which some other person was elected , he or she may only serve one more additional four - year term . </P> <H3> President </H3> Main article : President of the United States Seal of the President of the United States <P> The executive branch consists of the president and those to whom the president 's powers are delegated . The president is both the head of state and government , as well as the military commander - in - chief and chief diplomat . The president , according to the Constitution , must `` take care that the laws be faithfully executed '' , and `` preserve , protect and defend the Constitution '' . The president presides over the executive branch of the federal government , an organization numbering about 5 million people , including 1 million active - duty military personnel and 600,000 postal service employees . </P> <P> The president may sign legislation passed by Congress into law or may veto it , preventing it from becoming law unless two - thirds of both houses of Congress vote to override the veto . The president may unilaterally sign treaties with foreign nations . However , ratification of international treaties requires a two - thirds majority vote in the Senate . The president may be impeached by a majority in the House and removed from office by a two - thirds majority in the Senate for `` treason , bribery , or other high crimes and misdemeanors '' . The president may not dissolve Congress or call special elections but does have the power to pardon or release criminals convicted of offenses against the federal government ( except in cases of impeachment ) , enact executive orders , and ( with the consent of the Senate ) appoint Supreme Court justices and federal judges . </P> <H3> Vice president </H3> Main article : Vice President of the United States Seal of the Vice President of the United States <P> The vice president is the second - highest official in rank of the federal government . The office of the vice president 's duties and powers are established in the legislative branch of the federal government under Article 1 , Section 3 , Clauses 4 and 5 as the President of the Senate ; this means that he or she is the head of the Senate . In that capacity , the vice president is allowed to vote in the Senate , but only when necessary to break a tie vote . Pursuant to the Twelfth Amendment , the vice president presides over the joint session of Congress when it convenes to count the vote of the Electoral College . As first in the U.S. presidential line of succession , the vice president 's duties and powers move to the executive branch when becoming president upon the death , resignation , or removal of the president , which has happened nine times in U.S. history . Lastly , in the case of a Twenty - fifth Amendment succession event , the vice president would become acting president , assuming all of the powers and duties of president , except being designated as president . Accordingly , by circumstances , the Constitution designates the vice president as routinely in the legislative branch , or succeeding to the executive branch as president , or possibly being in both as acting president pursuant to the Twenty - fifth Amendment . Because of circumstances , the overlapping nature of the duties and powers attributed to the office , the title of the office and other matters , such has generated a spirited scholarly dispute regarding attaching an exclusive branch designation to the office of vice president . </P> <H3> Cabinet , executive departments , and agencies </H3> Main articles : Cabinet of the United States , United States federal executive departments , and List of federal agencies in the United States <P> The day - to - day enforcement and administration of federal laws is in the hands of the various federal executive departments , created by Congress to deal with specific areas of national and international affairs . The heads of the 15 departments , chosen by the president and approved with the `` advice and consent '' of the U.S. Senate , form a council of advisers generally known as the president 's `` Cabinet '' . Once confirmed , these `` cabinet officers '' serve at the pleasure of the president . In addition to departments , a number of staff organizations are grouped into the Executive Office of the President . These include the White House staff , the National Security Council , the Office of Management and Budget , the Council of Economic Advisers , the Council on Environmental Quality , the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative , the Office of National Drug Control Policy , and the Office of Science and Technology Policy . The employees in these United States government agencies are called federal civil servants . </P> <P> There are also independent agencies such as the United States Postal Service ( USPS ) , the National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( NASA ) , the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) , the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) , and the United States Agency for International Development ( USAID ) . In addition , there are government - owned corporations such as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the National Railroad Passenger Corporation . </P> <H2> Judicial branch </H2> Main articles : Federal judiciary of the United States and United States federal courts See also : Article Three of the United States Constitution <P> The Judiciary explains and applies the laws . This branch does this by hearing and eventually making decisions on various legal cases . </P> <H3> Overview of the federal judiciary </H3> Seal of the U.S. Supreme Court <P> Article III section I of the Constitution establishes the Supreme Court of the United States and authorizes the United States Congress to establish inferior courts as their need shall arise . Section I also establishes a lifetime tenure for all federal judges and states that their compensation may not be diminished during their time in office . Article II section II establishes that all federal judges are to be appointed by the president and confirmed by the United States Senate . </P> <P> The Judiciary Act of 1789 subdivided the nation jurisdictionally into judicial districts and created federal courts for each district . The three tiered structure of this act established the basic structure of the national judiciary : the Supreme Court , 13 courts of appeals , 94 district courts , and two courts of special jurisdiction . Congress retains the power to re-organize or even abolish federal courts lower than the Supreme Court . </P> <P> The U.S. Supreme Court adjudicates `` cases and controversies '' -- matters pertaining to the federal government , disputes between states , and interpretation of the United States Constitution , and , in general , can declare legislation or executive action made at any level of the government as unconstitutional , nullifying the law and creating precedent for future law and decisions . The United States Constitution does not specifically mention the power of judicial review ( the power to declare a law unconstitutional ) . The power of judicial review was asserted by Chief Justice Marshall in the landmark Supreme Court Case Marbury v. Madison ( 1803 ) . There have been instances in the past where such declarations have been ignored by the other two branches . Below the U.S. Supreme Court are the United States Courts of Appeals , and below them in turn are the United States District Courts , which are the general trial courts for federal law , and for certain controversies between litigants who are not deemed citizens of the same state ( `` diversity jurisdiction '' ) . </P> <P> There are three levels of federal courts with general jurisdiction , meaning that these courts handle criminal cases and civil lawsuits between individuals . Other courts , such as the bankruptcy courts and the Tax Court , are specialized courts handling only certain kinds of cases ( `` subject matter jurisdiction '' ) . The Bankruptcy Courts are `` under '' the supervision of the district courts , and , as such , are not considered part of the `` Article III '' judiciary and also as such their judges do not have lifetime tenure , nor are they Constitutionally exempt from diminution of their remuneration . Also the Tax Court is not an Article III court ( but is , instead an `` Article I Court '' ) . </P> <P> The district courts are the trial courts wherein cases that are considered under the Judicial Code ( Title 28 , United States Code ) consistent with the jurisdictional precepts of `` federal question jurisdiction '' and `` diversity jurisdiction '' and `` pendent jurisdiction '' can be filed and decided . The district courts can also hear cases under `` removal jurisdiction '' , wherein a case brought in State court meets the requirements for diversity jurisdiction , and one party litigant chooses to `` remove '' the case from state court to federal court . </P> <P> The United States Courts of Appeals are appellate courts that hear appeals of cases decided by the district courts , and some direct appeals from administrative agencies , and some interlocutory appeals . The U.S. Supreme Court hears appeals from the decisions of the courts of appeals or state supreme courts , and in addition has original jurisdiction over a few cases . </P> <P> The judicial power extends to cases arising under the Constitution , an Act of Congress ; a U.S. treaty ; cases affecting ambassadors , ministers and consuls of foreign countries in the U.S. ; cases and controversies to which the federal government is a party ; controversies between states ( or their citizens ) and foreign nations ( or their citizens or subjects ) ; and bankruptcy cases ( collectively `` federal - question jurisdiction '' ) . The Eleventh Amendment removed from federal jurisdiction cases in which citizens of one state were the plaintiffs and the government of another state was the defendant . It did not disturb federal jurisdiction in cases in which a state government is a plaintiff and a citizen of another state the defendant . </P> <P> The power of the federal courts extends both to civil actions for damages and other redress , and to criminal cases arising under federal law . The interplay of the Supremacy Clause and Article III has resulted in a complex set of relationships between state and federal courts . Federal courts can sometimes hear cases arising under state law pursuant to diversity jurisdiction , state courts can decide certain matters involving federal law , and a handful of federal claims are primarily reserved by federal statute to the state courts ( for example , those arising from the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 ) . Both court systems thus can be said to have exclusive jurisdiction in some areas and concurrent jurisdiction in others . </P> <P> The U.S. Constitution safeguards judicial independence by providing that federal judges shall hold office `` during good behavior '' ; in practice , this usually means they serve until they die , retire , or resign . A judge who commits an offense while in office may be impeached in the same way as the president or other officials of the federal government . U.S. judges are appointed by the president , subject to confirmation by the Senate . Another Constitutional provision prohibits Congress from reducing the pay of any Article III judge ( Congress is able to set a lower salary for all future judges that take office after the reduction , but may not decrease the rate of pay for judges already in office ) . </P> <H3> Relationships between state and federal courts </H3> <P> Separate from , but not entirely independent of , this federal court system are the court systems of each state , each dealing with , in addition to federal law when not deemed preempted , a state 's own laws , and having its own court rules and procedures . Although state governments and the federal government are legally dual sovereigns , the Supreme Court of the United States is in many cases the appellate court from the State Supreme Courts ( e.g. , absent the Court countenancing the applicability of the doctrine of adequate and independent State grounds ) . The Supreme Courts of each state are by this doctrine the final authority on the interpretation of the applicable state 's laws and Constitution . Many state constitution provisions are equal in breadth to those of the U.S. Constitution , but are considered `` parallel '' ( thus , where , for example , the right to privacy pursuant to a state constitution is broader than the federal right to privacy , and the asserted ground is explicitly held to be `` independent '' , the question can be finally decided in a State Supreme Court -- the U.S. Supreme Court will decline to take jurisdiction ) . </P> <P> A State Supreme Court , other than of its own accord , is bound only by the U.S. Supreme Court 's interpretation of federal law , but is not bound by interpretation of federal law by the federal court of appeals for the federal circuit in which the state is included , or even the federal district courts located in the state , a result of the dual sovereigns concept . Conversely , a federal district court hearing a matter involving only a question of state law ( usually through diversity jurisdiction ) must apply the substantive law of the state in which the court sits , a result of the application of the Erie Doctrine ; however , at the same time , the case is heard under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure , the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and the Federal Rules of Evidence instead of state procedural rules ( that is , the application of the Erie Doctrine only extends to a requirement that a federal court asserting diversity jurisdiction apply substantive state law , but not procedural state law , which may be different ) . Together , the laws of the federal and state governments form U.S. law . </P> <H2> Elections and voting </H2> Main article : Elections in the United States Diagram of the Federal Government and American Union , 1862 . <P> Suffrage , commonly known as the ability to vote , has changed significantly over time . In the early years of the United States , voting was considered a matter for state governments , and was commonly restricted to white men who owned land . Direct elections were mostly held only for the U.S. House of Representatives and state legislatures , although what specific bodies were elected by the electorate varied from state to state . Under this original system , both senators representing each state in the U.S. Senate were chosen by a majority vote of the state legislature . Since the ratification of the Seventeenth Amendment in 1913 , members of both houses of Congress have been directly elected . Today , U.S. citizens have almost universal suffrage under equal protection of the laws from the age of 18 , regardless of race , gender , or wealth . The only significant exception to this is the disenfranchisement of convicted felons , and in some states former felons as well . </P> <P> Under the U.S. Constitution , the national representation of U.S. territories and the federal district of Washington , D.C. in Congress is limited : while residents of the District of Columbia are subject to federal laws and federal taxes , their only congressional representative is a non-voting delegate ; however , they have been allowed to participate in presidential elections since March 29 , 1961 . Residents of U.S. territories have varying rights ; for example , only some residents of Puerto Rico pay federal income taxes ( though all residents must pay all other federal taxes , including import / export taxes , federal commodity taxes and federal payroll taxes , including Social Security and Medicare ) . All federal laws that are `` not locally inapplicable '' are automatically the law of the land in Puerto Rico but their current representation in the U.S. Congress is in the form of a Resident Commissioner , a nonvoting delegate . </P> <H2> State , tribal , and local governments </H2> Main articles : State governments of the United States , Tribal sovereignty in the United States , and Local government in the United States The states of the United States as divided into counties ( or , in Louisiana and Alaska , parishes and boroughs , respectively ) . Alaska and Hawaii are not to scale and the Aleutian and uninhabited Northwestern Hawaiian Islands have been omitted . <P> The state governments tend to have the greatest influence over most Americans ' daily lives . The Tenth Amendment prohibits the federal government from exercising any power not delegated to it by the States in the Constitution ; as a result , states handle the majority of issues most relevant to individuals within their jurisdiction . Because state governments are not authorized to print currency , they generally have to raise revenue through either taxes or bonds . As a result , state governments tend to impose severe budget cuts or raise taxes any time the economy is faltering . </P> <P> Each state has its own written constitution , government and code of laws . The Constitution stipulates only that each state must have , `` a Republican Government '' . Therefore , there are often great differences in law and procedure between individual states , concerning issues such as property , crime , health and education , amongst others . The highest elected official of each state is the Governor . Each state also has an elected state legislature ( bicameralism is a feature of every state except Nebraska ) , whose members represent the voters of the state . Each state maintains its own state court system . In some states , supreme and lower court justices are elected by the people ; in others , they are appointed , as they are in the federal system . </P> <P> As a result of the Supreme Court case Worcester v. Georgia , American Indian tribes are considered `` domestic dependent nations '' that operate as sovereign governments subject to federal authority but , in some cases , outside of the jurisdiction of state governments . Hundreds of laws , executive orders and court cases have modified the governmental status of tribes vis - \u00e0 - vis individual states , but the two have continued to be recognized as separate bodies . Tribal governments vary in robustness , from a simple council used to manage all aspects of tribal affairs , to large and complex bureaucracies with several branches of government . Tribes are currently encouraged to form their own governments , with power resting in elected tribal councils , elected tribal chairpersons , or religiously appointed leaders ( as is the case with pueblos ) . Tribal citizenship and voting rights are typically restricted to individuals of native descent , but tribes are free to set whatever citizenship requirements they wish . </P> <P> The institutions that are responsible for local government within states are typically town , city , or county boards , water management districts , fire management districts , library districts and other similar governmental units which make laws that affect their particular area . These laws concern issues such as traffic , the sale of alcohol and the keeping of animals . The highest elected official of a town or city is usually the mayor . In New England , towns operate in a direct democratic fashion , and in some states , such as Rhode Island , Connecticut , and some parts of Massachusetts , counties have little or no power , existing only as geographic distinctions . In other areas , county governments have more power , such as to collect taxes and maintain law enforcement agencies . </P> <H2> See also </H2> <Ul> <Li> Government of the United States portal </Li> </Ul> <Table> <Tr> <Td> <Dl> <Dt> President </Dt> </Dl> <Ul> <Li> Cabinet </Li> <Li> Executive order </Li> <Li> Federal executive departments </Li> <Li> President 's Executive Office </Li> <Li> Line - item veto </Li> </Ul> <Dl> <Dt> Courts </Dt> </Dl> <Ul> <Li> Bankruptcy courts </Li> <Li> Courts of appeals </Li> <Li> District courts </Li> <Li> Federal courts </Li> <Li> Federal judicial circuit </Li> <Li> Federal judicial district </Li> <Li> Supreme Court </Li> </Ul> </Td> <Td> <Dl> <Dt> Law </Dt> </Dl> <Ul> <Li> Constitution </Li> <Li> Governmental designations for places </Li> <Li> U.S. Code </Li> <Li> U.S. Law </Li> </Ul> <Dl> <Dt> Agencies </Dt> <Dd> Note : Most agencies are executive , but a few are legislative or judicial . </Dd> </Dl> <Ul> <Li> Federal agencies </Li> <Li> Independent agencies </Li> </Ul> </Td> <Td> <Dl> <Dt> States and territories </Dt> </Dl> <Ul> <Li> Political divisions </Li> <Li> U.S. states </Li> <Li> U.S. territory </Li> </Ul> <Dl> <Dt> Works and websites </Dt> </Dl> <Ul> <Li> Copyright status of work by the U.S. government </Li> <Li> U.S. Government Web Portal for Businesses </Li> <Li> U.S. Government Web Portal for Citizens </Li> </Ul> </Td> </Tr> </Table> <H2> References </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ Wood , 1998 p. 208 </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ ' The Influence of State Politics in Expanding Federal Power , ' Henry Jones Ford , ' Proceedings of the American Political Science Association , Vol. 5 , Fifth Annual Meeting ( 1908 ) ' Jstor.org Retrieved on March 17 , 2010 </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Judge Rules Favorably in Pennsylvania BRAC Suit ( Associated Press , 26 August ) </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ ' The Legislative Branch ' `` Archived copy '' .

Residents pay federal payroll taxes , such as Social Security ( See IRS.gov ) and Medicare ( See Reuters.com ) , as well as Commonwealth of Puerto Rico income taxes ( See Puertorico-herald.com and HTRCPA.com ) . Archived April 29 , 2011 , at the Wayback Machine . All federal employees ( See Heritage.org ) Archived February 10 , 2010 , at the Wayback Machine. , those who do business with the federal government ( See MCVPR.com ) Archived January 16 , 2010 , at WebCite , Puerto Rico - based corporations that intend to send funds to the U.S. ( See Page 9 , line 1 . ) , and some others ( For example , Puerto Rican residents that are members of the U.S. military , See Heritage.org and Puerto Rico residents who earned income from sources outside Puerto Rico , See pp 14 -- 15 . ) also pay federal income taxes . In addition , because the cutoff point for income taxation is lower than that of the U.S. IRS code , and because the per - capita income in Puerto Rico is much lower than the average per - capita income on the mainland , more Puerto Rico residents pay income taxes to the local taxation authority than if the IRS code were applied to the island . This occurs because `` the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico government has a wider set of responsibilities than do U.S. State and local governments '' ( See GAO.gov ) . As residents of Puerto Rico pay into Social Security , Puerto Ricans are eligible for Social Security benefits upon retirement , but are excluded from the Supplemental Security Income ( SSI ) ( Commonwealth of Puerto Rico residents , unlike residents of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands and residents of the 50 States , do not receive the SSI . See Socialsecurity.gov ) , and the island actually receives less than 15 % of the Medicaid funding it would normally receive if it were a U.S. state . However , Medicare providers receive less - than - full state - like reimbursements for services rendered to beneficiaries in Puerto Rico , even though the latter paid fully into the system ( See p. 252 ) . Archived May 11 , 2011 , at the Wayback Machine . It has also been estimated ( See Eagleforum.org that , because the population of the island is greater than that of 50 % of the states , if it were a state , Puerto Rico would have six to eight seats in the House , in addition to the two seats in the Senate. ( See Eagleforum.org , CRF-USA.org Archived June 10 , 2009 , at the Wayback Machine . and Thomas.gov ( Note that for the later , the official US Congress database website , you will need to resubmit a query . The document in question is called `` House Report 110 - 597 -- Puerto Rico Democracy Act of 2007 '' . These are the steps to follow : Thomas.gov > Committee Reports > 110 > drop down `` Word / Phrase '' and pick `` Report Number '' > type `` 597 '' next to Report Number . This will provide the document `` House Report 110 - 597 -- Puerto Rico Democracy Act of 2007 '' , then from the Table of Contents choose `` Background and need for legislation '' . ) ) . Another misconception is that the import / export taxes collected by the U.S. on products manufactured in Puerto Rico are all returned to the Puerto Rico Treasury . This is not the case . Such import / export taxes are returned only for rum products , and even then the US Treasury keeps a portion of those taxes ( See the `` House Report 110 - 597 -- Puerto Rico Democracy Act of 2007 '' mentioned above . ) </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ `` A brief overview of state fiscal conditions and the effects of federal policies on state budgets '' ( PDF ) .
