He rose to prominence playing Ron Weasley , one of the three main characters in the Harry Potter film series . Grint was cast as Ron at the age of 11 , having previously acted only in school plays and at his local theatre group . From 2001 to 2011 , he starred in all eight Harry Potter films alongside Daniel Radcliffe playing as Harry Potter and Emma Watson playing as Hermione Granger . </P> <P> Beginning in 2002 , Grint began to work outside of the Harry Potter franchise , playing a co-leading role in Thunderpants . He has had starring roles in Driving Lessons , a dramedy released in 2006 , and Cherrybomb , a drama film of limited release in 2010 . Grint co-starred with Bill Nighy and Emily Blunt in Wild Target , a comedy . His first film project following the end of the Harry Potter series was the 2012 anti-war film , Into the White , in which he has a supporting role . In 2013 , Grint 's new film CBGB was released and he was cast in CBS 's new show Super Clyde . Grint made his stage debut in Jez Butterworth 's Mojo in October 2013 at the Harold Pinter Theatre in London . In 2014 he voiced the character of Josh in Postman Pat : The Movie , and in 2017 , he starred in and was executive producer of the television series Snatch , based on the film of the same name . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Early life </Li> <Li> 2 Career <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Harry Potter ( 2001 -- 11 ) </Li> <Li> 2.2 Other work ( 2002 -- present ) </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Personal life </Li> <Li> 4 Filmography <Ul> <Li> 4.1 Film </Li> <Li> 4.2 Television </Li> <Li> 4.3 Theatre </Li> <Li> 4.4 Music </Li> <Li> 4.5 Other roles </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 5 Awards and nominations </Li> <Li> 6 See also </Li> <Li> 7 References </Li> <Li> 8 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Early life ( edit ) </H2> <P> Grint was born in Harlow , Essex , England , to Nigel Grint ( b . 1963 ) , a dealer in racing memorabilia , and Joanne Grint ( n\u00e9e Parsons ; b . 1967 ) . Grint is the eldest of five siblings , the others being James ( b . 1990 ) , Georgina ( b . 1993 ) , Samantha and Charlotte . He has stated that his earliest goal in life was to become an ice cream man . He attended Richard Hale School , in Hertford . </P> <P> While in school , Grint took an avid interest in theatre . He started performing in school productions and joined the Top Hat Stage and Screen School , a local theatre group that cast him as a fish in Noah 's Ark and a donkey in another nativity play . He continued performing in school plays as he moved into secondary school . However , Grint had never acted professionally before the Harry Potter series . </P> <P> At the age of 16 , he left school to focus on his acting career . `` I did n't really like school that much , '' he later commented . </P> <H2> Career ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Harry Potter ( 2001 -- 11 ) ( edit ) </H3> Grint outside at the 2007 premiere of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix in Toronto , Ontario , Canada Handprints , footprints and wand prints of ( from left to right ) Watson , Radcliffe , Grint <P> Starting in 2000 , casting began for the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Philosopher 's Stone , the best - selling novel written by author J.K. Rowling . Rowling personally insisted that the cast be British and assisted Susie Figgis and director Chris Columbus in casting the roles . Grint chose to audition for the role of protagonist Ron Weasley , one of Harry Potter 's best friends at Hogwarts , and was a fan of the book series . Having seen a Newsround report about the open casting , he sent in a video of himself rapping about how he wished to receive the role . His attempt was successful as the casting team asked for a meeting with him . On 8 August 2000 , Daniel Radcliffe , Emma Watson , and an 11 - year - old Grint were selected to play the roles of Harry , Hermione Granger , and Ron , respectively . Grint is the oldest member of the trio . The release of Harry Potter and the Philosopher 's Stone in 2001 was Grint 's debut screen performance . Breaking records for opening - day sales and opening - weekend takings , it was the highest - grossing film of that year . With a total of US $974 million in its theatrical run , Philosopher 's Stone stands as the second most commercially successful entry in the series . It was also critically well - received , scoring mainly positive reviews from critics . However , a number of critics found the adaption staying faithful to the book to be both its best and worst quality . Grint won a Satellite Award in the category of `` Outstanding New Talent '' , and a Young Artist Award for `` Most Promising Young Newcomer '' . </P> <P> A year later , Grint again starred as Ron in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets ( 2002 ) , the second installment of the series . The film opened to positive reviews and critics generally enjoyed the lead actors ' performances . Both Los Angeles Times and New York Magazine observed that Grint and his peers had matured between films , with the latter pointing out that Grint had become `` more proficient '' and said they missed `` the amateurish ardour '' the actor and Watson carried in Philosopher 's Stone . Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban ( 2004 ) was released on 31 May in the UK . The film sees all three of its lead characters hover on the brink of adolescence , `` and while they look braver and more capable than before , the dangers they face seem far more grave and their own vulnerability more intense . '' Academy Award - nominee Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n took over direction for Prisoner of Azkaban which remains the lowest - grossing Harry Potter film with US $795 million in revenue . Nonetheless it was the second highest - grossing movie of 2004 behind Shrek 2 . Despite this it remains the second highest rated in the series in terms of critical reaction . </P> Grint signing autographs at the 2009 premiere of Harry Potter and the Half - Blood Prince <P> In 2005 , Grint reprised his role again for the fourth film in the series -- Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire . The adaptation , unlike previous films , explored romantic elements and included more humour . In a 2005 interview with IGN , all three lead actors singled out the humour as being a reason for the film 's success . This project was directed by Mike Newell . According to the actor , the director was `` really loud and not afraid to swear at you , but he was really cool . '' Goblet of Fire stands as one of the best reviewed instalments within the series , and is noted for the maturity and sophistication of its characters , darker and more complex plotline , writing and performances of the lead actors . Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix , the fifth film in the Harry Potter franchise , was released to cinemas in 2007 . A huge financial success , Order of the Phoenix set a record worldwide opening - weekend gross of US $394 million , superseding Spider - Man 3 as the title holder . This entry was directed by a new filmmaker , David Yates , who would continue to direct all of the following movies . Grint said the laid back director was `` really good '' and helped keep the material fresh . As the fame of the actor and the series continued , Grint and fellow Harry Potter cast members left imprints of their hands , feet and wands in front of Grauman 's Chinese Theater in Hollywood . </P> <P> On 15 July 2009 , the series 's sixth instalment , Harry Potter and the Half - Blood Prince , was released . It did considerably better financially than the previous film , again setting new box office records . In its total theatrical run , Half - Blood Prince totalled in US $933 million ticket sales . Also , Half - Blood Prince remains one of the most positively reviewed entries within the series among film critics , who praised the film 's `` emotionally satisfying '' story , direction , cinematography , visuals and music . Grint observed a change in Ron in this entry , pointing out that his once insecure , often overshadowed character started to become more secure and even began to show a dark side of himself . The actor found it fun to personify a more emotional Ron . Between 2009 and 2010 , his work received three nominations , including one win -- an Otto Award from the German magazine Bravo . </P> Radcliffe , Watson and Grint at the Deathly Hallows -- Part 2 premiere in London , July 2011 <P> Despite the success of the past films , the future of the franchise was put into question as all three lead actors were unsure about signing on to continue their roles for the final two films . However , by March 2007 , Grint agreed to return for the last instalments . For financial and scripting reasons , the last book was divided into two films which were shot back to back , with filming concluding in June 2010 . After completing the final film he said : `` I mean it literally has been my childhood and suddenly it all came down to really just one random scene , with us jumping through a fireplace , and then it was over . ( ... ) But because you shoot out of sequence , it 's often just ' Turn left , cross the room , okay , that 's a wrap . ' And you 're done . ( ... ) Yeah , it 's very odd . Because suddenly it was all over , just like that . It was really emotional for all of us , realising that we 're never going to be doing this again . </P> Grint at the film premiere of Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows -- Part 1 at the Alice Tully Center in New York City on 15 November 2010 <P> Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows -- Part 1 ( 2010 ) was released in November and made over US $950 million . It set several box office records and opened to mostly favourable reviews in the media . His portrayal of Ron again earned him critical praise . Reviewing the adaption in Slate , Dana Stevens called all three of the leads `` terrific . '' Despite giving Deathly Hallows -- Part 1 a negative rating , Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal publication stated `` Grint has grown up to be a skilful actor who knows the value of a slow burn '' . New York Post writer Lou Lumenick , however , observed that both Grint and Radcliffe had grown weary of playing the same characters and expressed it in their performances . Grint 's performance scored him nominations from the MTV Movie Awards and National Movie Awards for Best Fight and Performance of the Year in 2011 . Grint reprised his role for the eighth time , in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows -- Part 2 , the last Harry Potter instalment . This film picked - up from where the previous film left - off and included a lot of action , whereas the first part had focused more on character development . Rupert , along with the film , was critically acclaimed : Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post asked , `` Who could have predicted that Radcliffe , Grint and Watson would turn out to be good actors ? '' . The film broke several box office records , including biggest midnight release , biggest first - day opening , and biggest opening - weekend . Deathly Hallows -- Part 2 got up to the 4th highest - grossing film of all time , and is the second highest - grossing non-James Cameron film with more than US $1.3 billion worldwide ( behind The Avengers ) . </P> <P> Harry Potter 's author J.K. Rowling gave a speech during the final , world premiere of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows -- Part 2 on 7 July 2011 in London , England . She announced that there are seven Harry Potter film series cast members , to whom she refers as `` The Big Seven , '' and she named Grint as one of the seven members , alongside Daniel Radcliffe , Emma Watson , Tom Felton , Matthew Lewis , Evanna Lynch and Bonnie Wright . </P> <H3> Other work ( 2002 -- present ) ( edit ) </H3> <P> In 2002 , Grint starred in his first non-Harry Potter film , Thunderpants , which revolves around Patrick ( played by Bruce Cook ) whose remarkable capacity for flatulence scores him a job as an astronaut . In this film , Grint portrayed the co-lead role of Alan , an anosmic boy who is Patrick 's only friend . It was generally ignored by critics and audiences alike . Most of the critics that did take notice of Thunderpants did not respond well to it , with one writing : `` This film should be shown in prisons so that inmates have a good reason to never return . '' Another film he appeared in was Driving Lessons , a comedy - drama released in 2006 , where he starred opposite Julie Walters . The film was met with a mixed reception by critics , but his portrayal of an oppressed teenaged boy was generally praised . `` Grint , on the other hand , is a revelation '' , who `` displays an innate naturalness mixed with personal charisma that turn a potentially pathetic Christian freak into a humorous , thoroughly likable -- if more than a little awkward -- young man '' , wrote Alt Film Guide 's Andre Soares . </P> <P> In July 2008 , it was announced that Grint would star in the drama film Cherrybomb with Robert Sheehan and Kimberley Nixon . Grint found shooting this film very different from the Harry Potter films since he had to adjust to doing a dozen scenes per day . Grint 's character -- Malachy , a worker at Belfast -- goes to great lengths to impress his boss 's daughter , with whom he is infatuated . This film , like his next project , would involve him playing violent roles . Despite premiering at the 2009 Berlin International Film Festival , the film was initially unable to find a distributor . An online campaign by Grint 's fans was credited with helping to secure a deal for distribution in the UK in 2010 . </P> <P> Jonathan Lynn directed Grint in Wild Target , a 2010 comedy thriller film , which he starred in alongside Emily Blunt and Bill Nighy . A remake of the 1993 French film Cible Emouvante , Wild Target was made on a relatively small production budget of US $8 million . However , it was a commercial failure , only earning back US $3.4 million . It also garnered mostly negative reviews in the media , which criticised it for dishonouring the original film and wasting the comedic potential of its cast , but Grint also attracted some positive notice : `` It 's nice to see Rupert Grint perform well in a role other than that of Ron Weasley , and it 's clear that he 's got a career ahead of him . '' </P> <P> In January 2011 , Grint made a cameo appearance in BBC popular comedy show Come Fly with Me starring comedy duo Matt Lucas and David Walliams ( Little Britain ) . In March 2011 , Grint was cast as the lead character in the small - budget anti-war Norwegian film Into the White , which was directed by Petter N\u00e6ss . Principal photography started in April , and the project , which was shot on location , was released in 2012 . Into the White is based on a real incident that took place on 27 April 1940 , when German Luftwaffe pilot Horst Schopis 's bomber was shot down at Grotli by a Royal Navy Fleet Air Arm Blackburn Skua , which then crash - landed . The several German and British crew members found shelter by chance during a harsh winter there . </P> Grint at the US premiere of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows -- Part 2 in July 2011 <P> In August 2011 , Grint did a photo shoot with his friend and Harry Potter co-star Tom Felton in Los Angeles for the autumn / winter collection of the fashion label Band of Outsiders . In September 2011 , it was announced that Grint would voice a character in the film adaptation of Postman Pat along with David Tennant , Stephen Mangan and Jim Broadbent ; the film was released in May 2014 . Grint also appears in the music video for Ed Sheeran 's song `` Lego House '' ; the video was released on 20 October 2011 . </P> <P> In March 2012 , the `` Visit Britain '' TV ad was released , which features Grint alongside Julie Walters , Michelle Dockery and Stephen Fry . The TV ad promotes holidaying at home in the UK . </P> <P> On 14 March 2012 , Variety reported that Grint had been cast alongside Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz in The Drummer , a biopic film about drummer Dennis Wilson of the Beach Boys . On the same day , The Hollywood Reporter confirmed this and announced filming was scheduled to begin on 15 June 2012 in California and Savannah , Georgia </P> <P> On 25 July 2012 , Grint carried the 2012 London Olympic torch during the Olympic Torch Relay , which is part of 2012 Summer Olympic Games in London . In interviews , Rupert told the BBC News that it was an `` overwhelming '' experience that he hoped to remember forever , and told The Daily Telegraph `` It was amazing , it was really overwhelming . It 's just such an honour to be a part of this . I 'm really proud '' . </P> <P> In October 2012 , Grint narrated We Are Aliens , a 25min 3D Planetarium Fulldome film about the possibility of other intelligent life in our Universe . </P> <P> On 13 February 2013 , The Hollywood Reporter 's Live Feed announced that Grint would star in a television show on CBS called Super Clyde . `` Grint will play the title role of Clyde , the well - meaning and sweet yet slightly neurotic guy who never feels like he really fits in . The avid comic book reader considers himself a borderline agoraphobic with mild to severe anxiety issues who wishes he were a super hero himself . When Clyde inherits a $100,000 a month inheritance from his long - dead eccentric Uncle Bill , he decides that the cash will be his secret super power and will use it only for good and reward the good - hearted . '' </P> <P> In July 2013 , it was confirmed that Grint will be making his stage debut in Jez Butterworth 's second run of his black comedy , Mojo , playing the role as a minor hood called Sweets who pops amphetamines like Smarties and does a sort of double act , full of comic menace . Grint will be starring alongside actors Brendan Coyle , Ben Whishaw and Daniel Mays . The play is based on real - life events and ran from 26 October 2013 until 8 February 2014 at the Harold Pinter Theatre in London . He won the WhatsOnStage Award for Best London Newcomer for his role in this play . </P> <P> In September 2013 , The Hollywood Reporter confirmed that in an adaptation of Macbeth called Enemy of Man , Grint will be starring with Sean Bean , Charles Dance , Jason Flemyng , James D'Arcy , Neil Maskell and Joe Gilgun , directed by Vincent Regan . The filming production began in January 2014 in the United Kingdom . </P> <P> In June 2014 , it was announced that Grint would make his Broadway debut as Frank Finger in the play It 's Only a Play at the Gerald Schoenfeld Theatre , appearing alongside Matthew Broderick , Nathan Lane , Stockard Channing , and Megan Mullally . Grint 's first performance was on 28 August 2014 and his last performance was on 4 January 2015 . </P> <H2> Personal life ( edit ) </H2> <P> Grint is involved with charity , having donated items such as clothes to charity auctions , as well as participating in the Wacky Rally in 2010 with James and Oliver Phelps , which raised money for Britain 's Royal National Lifeboat Institution . He was one of more than forty participants to produce designs for Chrysalis Collection for Keech Hospice Care in London .
