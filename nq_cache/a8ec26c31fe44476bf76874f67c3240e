As of September 2017 , there were 57 Pak'nSave stores operating across the North and South Islands of New Zealand . </P> <P> Pak'nSave's key policy is to provide everyday food and groceries at low prices , which they state in their current slogan ( as of March 2013 ) ' Our Policy : NZ 's Lowest Food Prices ' . Stores are large and have a no - frills environment , often with unlined interiors and concrete floors . Customers are left to pack their own bags , and charged for plastic bags in most stores . Many stores offer boxes set on or under a large desk where customers can pack their groceries for easier convenience . Pak'nSave is still the cheapest supermarket in New Zealand . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 History </Li> <Li> 2 Operations <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Competition </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Marketing </Li> <Li> 4 Fuel discounts <Ul> <Li> 4.1 Fuel sites </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 5 Fundraising </Li> <Li> 6 References </Li> <Li> 7 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> History ( edit ) </H2> <P> Pak'nSave was developed following a trip by a group of Foodstuffs executives to the United States in 1985 . On that visit they saw Cub Foods , operated by SuperValu , Pak ' n Save operated by Safeway , and other box warehouse supermarkets . Foodstuffs then copied this format in New Zealand . The original Pak'nSave format was almost an identical copy of Safeway 's Pak ' n Save chain in northern California . </P> <P> The first store , styled `` PAK ' N SAVE '' , opened in June 1985 at Kaitaia in the North Island . </P> <H2> Operations ( edit ) </H2> Pak'nSave store in New Plymouth <P> As of September 2017 , there were 57 Pak'nSave stores across New Zealand . </P> <P> The name probably originates from the cost - saving practice of leaving customers to pack their own groceries , with checkout operators simply placing the products purchased back into a trolley . Pak'nSave provides the cardboard boxes used for shipping products to the store , or plastic supermarket bags can be purchased at the checkout for 10 cents . Customers are encouraged to purchase longer - lasting bags or to bring their own . </P> <P> The stores are laid out as supermarket aisles , but with minimalistic design , and often perpendicular to the checkout lanes rather than the traditional parallel found in other New Zealand supermarkets and retailers . Extra products that are not on shelves are stacked above the shelves on the pallets they were delivered in . meaning that the floor space can be used for retail and storage . The stores are supplied daily from their co-operative distributor Foodstuffs . </P> <P> Pak'nSave stores often buys stock in bulk . This process means that stores do n't offer a wide variety of brands and pack sizes as full - service supermarkets , with products often restricted to market leaders and store brands . A 2009 Consumer magazine survey noticed the lack of range especially in the pet food and toilet paper categories . </P> <P> Most stores have self checkout and some have self scanning facilities . Self - checkout facilities are small checkout for express ( 15 items or less ) purchases , where customers scan and bag their own groceries , with several self - checkouts monitored over by a single staff member for assistance and to clear any restricted transactions ( e.g. alcohol ) . Self - scanning facilities ( Shop n ' Go ) are where a pre-registered customer scans each item with a hand - held scanner as they put them in their trolley . This reduces waiting time at the checkout , with most customers only requiring to pay for the groceries , although random rescans do take place . All stores have conventional checkout operator scanning available . </P> <H3> Competition ( edit ) </H3> <P> Pak'nSave's main competitors are Countdown , owned by Progressive Enterprises , and Foodstuffs ' full - service supermarket , New World . </P> <P> In the annual Consumer magazine survey of supermarket prices , Pak'nSave has been named the country 's cheapest supermarket ( either unanimously or by majority of centres surveyed ) in all eleven surveys since the current survey methodology was adopted in 2003 . The latest survey was conducted in May 2013 , which was based on the purchase of forty common products , including food , non-alcoholic drinks , personal care and cleaning items ( but excluding meat , fresh fruit and vegetables due to quality comparison issues and alcohol due to local licensing rules and heavy discounting practises ) . In the survey , Pak'nSave was named cheapest in six of the seven centres surveyed ( north Auckland , south - east Auckland , Tauranga , Napier - Hastings , Christchurch and Dunedin ) , and was named second - cheapest in the remaining centre ( Wellington ) behind Countdown . </P> <P> Pak'nSave also came out the cheapest supermarkets in the 2001 and 2002 Consumer magazine surveys . These surveys were paper surveys where prices on 140 items were recorded by surveyors visiting the supermarket and recording the shelf prices . However , the method was prone to supermarkets cheating by temporarily marking down shelf prices while the surveyor was in store , and the method was scrapped in 2003 . Since then , the survey is conducted on only forty items , purchased by undercover surveyors through the checkouts and the prices taken from the till receipt , with the food purchased donated to local food banks . </P> <H2> Marketing ( edit ) </H2> <P> Pak'nSave is well known for its `` cut price '' television and print adverts utilising a stick figure , named `` Stickman '' , in black on a yellow background ( occasionally , the colour scheme is reversed , including during the 2011 Rugby World Cup and the 2012 Summer Olympics ) . The television adverts are voiced by comedian Paul Ego . </P> <P> In 2011 , the Stickman adverts were one of the finalists for Best Ad in the annual Fair Go Ad Awards , but ultimately lost ( by landslide ) to the New Zealand Lotteries Commission 's `` Wilson the Dog '' adverts . </P> <H2> Fuel discounts ( edit ) </H2> <P> Pak'nSave offers fuel discounts to shoppers for spending a qualifying amount on shopping . Pak'nSave stores with on - site Pak'nSave fuel filling stations offer vouchers to use at these stations . The Pak'nSave fuel vouchers are unique in that they can only be used at the fuel site associated with the store of purchase , whereas all other New Zealand supermarkets ' fuel discount vouchers operate at any participating station across the country . Stores without on - site Pak'nSave fuel filling stations offer vouchers for use at Mobil service stations ( before January 2013 , the vouchers were accepted at Mobil instead ) . Competition for fuel discounts has grown in the past few years , with cases of offering discounts of 50 cents per litre to customers when they spend at least $400 in store . The standard fuel price at the Pak'nSave pump can often be higher than that of neighbouring service stations , thereby partially negating the Pak'nSave discount . </P> <H3> Fuel sites ( edit ) </H3> <P> In December 2002 , the first Pak'nSave fuel site was opened at the Pak'nSave in Tamatea . It was originally owned by BP New Zealand and Foodstuffs . More fuel sites were opened in more Pak'nSave stores and New World joined for the fuel sites later . In 2012 , when BP New Zealand ended its contract with Foodstuffs , they changed ownership to Mobil and Foodstuffs . </P> <H2> Fundraising ( edit ) </H2> <P> In November 2015 Pak'nSave stores around New Zealand participated in the annual Movember fundraising effort , raising NZ $106,000 for Movember New Zealand . This was the largest sum ever raised by a New Zealand company for the charity . </P> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ `` Pak'nSave wins price fight again '' .
