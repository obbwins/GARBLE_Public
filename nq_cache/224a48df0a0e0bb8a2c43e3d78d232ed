{"document_text": "List of Texas Revolution battles - wikipedia <H1> List of Texas Revolution battles </H1> Jump to : navigation , search <P> When General Santa Anna changed the constitution and began operating as a dictator , Federalists throughout the country revolted ; in Texas , an armed uprising began on October 2 when settlers refused to return a small cannon to Mexican troops . This ( Battle of Gonzales ) ended with Mexican troops retreating empty handed to San Antonio de Bexar ( now the U.S. city of San Antonio , Texas ) . Emboldened by their victory , the Texans formed a volunteer army . A small force of Texans traveled down the Texas coastline , defeating Mexican troops at Goliad and at Fort Lipantitl\u00e1n . The majority of the Texan troops followed General Stephen F. Austin to Bexar , where they initiated a siege of the Mexican garrison . After victories in several skirmishes , including the Battle of Concepci\u00f3n and the Grass Fight , the Texans attacked Bexar . After several days of fighting , the Siege of Bexar ended with the surrender of Mexican general The youngest person in the Alamo was 16 years old </P> <P> Many Texans believed the war was now over , and the majority of the settlers returned to their homes . The remaining troops were garrisoned at the Alamo Mission in Bexar and at Presidio La Bahia in Goliad . In early January , a large number of the remaining soldiers , most of them adventurers recently arrived from the United States , began clamoring to invade Mexico . Colonel Frank W. Johnson and Dr. James Grant began preparing to attack Matamoros . </P> <P> Even before Cos 's defeat , Santa Anna had been making plans to retake Texas . In January , he led the `` Army of Operations in Texas '' towards the rebellious territory . At the Rio Grande , the army divided ; Santa Anna led the bulk of the troops toward Bexar , where he laid siege to the Alamo . The remaining troops , under General Jose de Urrea , traveled up the coastline , easily defeating Johnson and Grant at the battles of San Patricio and Agua Dulce . News of these first Mexican victories cheered the Mexican force gathered at Bexar . On March 6 , Santa Anna ordered an assault on the Alamo ; all but a few of the defenders were killed . A woman , the wife of an Alamo defender , her baby , and a slave of an Alamo defender were released to tell Sam Houston what had happened . They were told to say that everyone would either surrender or die . News of the Texan defeat and approach of the Mexican army terrified the settlers ; in an event later known as the Runaway Scrape , settlers , the Texas government , and the remnants of the Texan army under the command of Sam Houston fled east , away from the approaching army . Houston ordered Colonel James Fannin to abandon Goliad and join his retreat . However , Fannin delayed his departure and sent a quarter of his troops to help evacuate the settlers at Refugio . Centralist forces in the area were stronger than the Texans expected at Refugio and defeated them . After receiving word of the defeat , Fannin finally began his retreat . His men were quickly overtaken and surrounded by Mexican soldiers . Fannin fought courageously at the Battle of Coleto , but was forced to surrender . He and his 300 men were taken prisoner , but just days later were executed in the Goliad Massacre . </P> <P> The only remaining Texan troops were those retreating with Houston . After learning that Santa Anna had again divided his forces , Houston ordered an attack on April 21 , 1836 . Crying `` Remember the Alamo '' and `` Remember Goliad '' , the Texans showed little mercy during the Battle of San Jacinto . Santa Anna was captured in hiding the following day and he ordered his army to return to Mexico , ending the Texas Revolution . </P> <Dl> <Dt> Key </Dt> <Dd> ( M ) -- Mexican victory </Dd> <Dd> ( T ) -- Texan victory </Dd> </Dl> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Battle </Th> <Th> Location </Th> <Th> Date ( s ) </Th> <Th> Engagement remarks </Th> <Th> Victor </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Battle of Gonzales </Td> <Td> Gonzales </Td> <Td> October 2 , 1835 </Td> <Td> This battle resulted in the first casualties of the Texas Revolution .

One Texan was injured , and Richard Andrews became the first Texan soldier to die in battle . Between 14 and 76 Mexican soldiers were killed .
