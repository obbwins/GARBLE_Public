D. ( born Joy Keenan ) is a fictional character portrayed by Emily Deschanel in the American Fox television series Bones . An anthropologist , forensic anthropologist , and kinesiologist , she is described in the series as a leading authority in the field of forensic anthropology . Brennan first appeared on television , along with other series characters , in the `` Pilot '' episode of Bones on September 13 , 2005 . She is the main protagonist of the series along with FBI Special Agent Seeley Booth ( David Boreanaz ) . </P> <P> Brennan is loosely based on author Kathy Reichs . Her name originates from the heroine in Reichs 's crime novel series , also named Temperance Brennan . The main similarity the two share is their occupation as forensic anthropologists . Brennan appeared in Comcast 's list of TV 's Most Intriguing Characters . She was included in AfterEllen.com 's Top 50 Favorite Female TV Characters . Her relationship with Seeley Booth was listed in Entertainment Weekly 's `` 30 Best ' Will They / Wo n't They ? ' TV Couples '' . </P> <H2> Contents </H2> <Ul> <Li> 1 Character history <Ul> <Li> 1.1 Family and early life </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 Characterization </Li> <Li> 3 Relationships <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Seeley Booth </Li> <Li> 3.2 Tim `` Sully '' Sullivan </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 References </Li> <Li> 5 Further reading </Li> </Ul> <H2> Character history ( edit ) </H2> <P> Temperance `` Bones '' Brennan is a forensic anthropologist who works in the Medico - Legal lab at the Jeffersonian Institute in Washington , D.C. She received her Ph. D. from Northwestern University , as stated in `` The Girl in the Fridge '' . She has three doctorates , as referred to by Dr. Jack Hodgins in the episode `` The Parts of the Sum in the Whole '' , in anthropology , forensic anthropology and kinesiology ; it is implied that most of her work at the lab was related to either long - dead bodies or victims of genocide . </P> <P> Her occasional contract work for the FBI shifted the focus of her work . She was paired with FBI Special Agent Seeley Booth , and helped to solve two difficult cases ; since then , they have worked together almost exclusively on modern - day murder cases . </P> <P> Brennan works with a group of other well - qualified colleagues , including the entomologist Jack Hodgins , her boss and forensic pathologist Camille Saroyan , forensic artist Angela Montenegro , and a host of eager graduate students . Booth refers to her crew of colleagues as `` squints '' , because they come to crime scenes and squint at evidence . He is also responsible for her nickname , `` Bones '' , which she initially detested . </P> <P> In the first - season finale ( which aired on May 17 , 2006 ) , Brennan stated that she was born in 1976 , which would have made her either 29 or 30 ( approximately the same age as Deschanel , who was born on October 11 , 1976 ) . In the fifth - season episode `` The Death of the Queen Bee '' ( which aired nearly four years later , on April 15 , 2010 ) , it is implied that her then - current age was 33 years ( based on Brennan 's identification of a former high school classmate as the victim and statement that the classmate was 33 ) . </P> <P> First mentioned in season 1 , Brennan has a love of dolphins , which she shared with her late mother : in the season one finale , `` The Woman in Limbo '' , Brennan examines a custom - made belt with a dolphin on the buckle , which had belonged to her mother , and which she mentions having once borrowed without asking first . Brennan 's love of dolphins is highlighted again in season 2 episodes `` The Titan on the Tracks '' , `` The Killer in the Concrete '' and `` Stargazer in a Puddle '' , when she mentions the constellation Delphinus , ( the Dolphin ) , her and her mother 's favorite . In season 6 , `` The Doctor in the Photo '' , she is shown to wear a dolphin ring . </P> <P> In `` Mummy in the Maze '' , Brennan exhibited ophidiophobia when confronted with snakes , but later only shows a moment of fright when confronted with another snake in `` The Mastodon in the Room '' . She takes note of this , voicing her observation that she only seems to lose her head around snakes when Booth is also `` there to be jumped upon '' , and also she mentions that she once had a pet snake during high school . It should also be noted that , in `` The Man in the Morgue , '' Brennan handled a snake without any trace of fear , even while Booth is in the room . </P> <P> In season one , in `` A Man on Death Row '' , Dr. Brennan expresses her stance on the death penalty ; `` I believe in the death penalty . There are certain people who should n't be in this world . The people who hacked hundreds of innocent children to death in Rwanda ; beheaded them at their desks at school ! The people who did that , they should be executed . '' In `` The Woman at the Airport '' , Dr. Brennan is shown to have a strong dislike for plastic surgeons , believing them to be no more than `` glorified butchers with medical degrees '' , and this dislike is voiced again in season 4 , in `` Cinderella in the Cardboard '' . In `` The Woman in the Car '' , Dr. Brennan reveals that her third doctorate is in kinesiology , a field that would allow her and Angela to unravel how one of the bodies that had been found had been killed . </P> <P> In season two , she expressed the desire to get a pet pig , whom she would have named `` Jasper '' . Brennan 's expertise in kinesiology would again prove its worth in `` The Truth in the Lye '' ( she could tell that one of the murder suspects was pregnant just from having observed her gait ) , in `` The Girl with the Curl '' ( she could tell if one of the young beauty pageant contestants was suffering from scoliosis just by watching them perform on stage ) , and in `` The Woman in the Sand '' ( while undercover with Booth , she was able to tell Booth exactly how to beat his opponent from just having watched his moves ) . In `` Judas on a Pole '' , she and her brother are identified as having the same blood type , blood type O. In `` Glowing Bones in the Old Stone House '' , she is shown to be a good cook : Booth 's comment on her mac and cheese is that he 'd `` like to be alone with it '' . </P> <P> In the season 3 episode , `` Mummy in the Maze '' , it is revealed that Brennan 's favorite superhero is Wonder Woman , and that she always goes as Wonder Woman to the Jeffersonian 's Halloween party . In `` The Baby in the Bough '' , it is revealed that Brennan is a registered foster parent , at her brother 's request , to take in his stepdaughters in case anything should happen to him and his girlfriend . In the season 3 episode , `` Intern in the Incinerator '' , Booth reveals that Brennan 's favorite flower is a Daffodil , her second favorite flower is a Daisy , and her favorite planet is Jupiter . </P> <P> In season 5 , in `` The Death of the Queen Bee '' , when asked if she 'd had a pet rat , Brennan discloses that she , in fact , had a pet mouse , snake and some spiders . During her time at Burtonsville high school , her only friend was the school custodian , Ray Buxley , with whom she would enjoy long , in - depth conversations on life and death , and who would also provide her with dead animals to dissect ( Brennan having set out to become a forensic anthropologist , ) and who would later be one of her books ' biggest fans ( she having named the killer in her first book , Bred in the Bone , after him ) . According to the Burtonsville high school on - line yearbook entry on Brennan , in her senior year , she was a member of the Chemistry club and Math club , her interests were chemistry and mathematics , and she was a National Merit Scholar and an Academic All Star . </P> <P> In the season 6 episode , `` The Blackout in the Blizzard '' , Brennan mentions her pet iguana for the first time . This same episode show that one of the number of scientific publications that Brennan reads is Medicinal Physics Quarterly , with one article on electrostatics and triboluminescence proving useful during the lab 's power outage . Further concerning her pet iguana in `` The Truth in the Myth '' , as a part of his rehab from alcohol abuse , Vincent Nigel - Murry made apologies for , among other things , having borrowed her iguana one night , wearing him as a hat for a party . She comments that he must have taken good care of her iguana as she has observed nothing wrong with him and further expresses some surprise that Vincent Nigel - Murry was able to get her iguana to stay perched atop his head , to which he replies that he was good with ribbons . </P> <P> In season 8 , `` The Tiger in the Tale '' , Booth mentions to Sweets that Dr. Brennan once took Peyote with Native Americans . </P> <P> In season 11 , `` The Senator in the Street Sweeper '' , Dr. Brennan is mentioned to be a member of the Green Party of the United States along with Dr. Hodgins . </P> <H3> Family and early life ( edit ) </H3> <P> Although Brennan seemed to have a relatively normal childhood , her parents disappeared when she was 15 years old . Her older brother Russ , himself still an adolescent , was unable to care for her and she was put in the foster care system . By the time she started college she had been to twelve different schools and has specifically said that she hated the lack of consistency . </P> <P> There has been contradictory evidence about her time in the system ; in one episode , Brennan stated that her grandfather got her out of the foster system , but in a later episode , she indicates that she never knew her grandparents ( possibly the two references are to two separate sets of grandparents , paternal and maternal ) . However , taking into consideration the fact that Brennan 's parents had assumed new identities when she was 3 - years - old , the grandfather who had taken her in from her time in the foster system may not have been her biological grandfather . </P> <P> Her time in foster care was quite traumatic and abusive ; Brennan indicated that she was once locked in the trunk of a car for two days because she broke a plate , and in the episode `` The Finger in the Nest '' , she reveals to Booth that she walked into her elderly neighbor 's house to find the woman dead . In the same episode , she also mentions to Booth that her parents were very concerned about her afterwards , because she started faking her own death . In Season 2 , she mentions that during her time in the foster care system , she kept a list of foster homes she had been kicked out of on the bottom of her shoe . </P> <P> In the first season she hands Booth the file on her parents ' disappearance and he agrees to look into it as a personal favor . It is later revealed in Season 2 that her parents , who were bank robbers specializing in safety deposit boxes , changed the family 's identity after they stole some damaging FBI documents regarding the murder of an FBI agent and the false imprisonment of civil rights activist Marvin Beckett . Brennan 's birth name was Joy Keenan . Her mother ( real name Ruth Keenan , known under the assumed identity of Christine Brennan ) had hoped to someday return to her children and family , but made a tape for Brennan to watch on her 16th birthday in case that never happened . Brennan later discovered that Ruth / Christine was murdered in 1993 , two years after she and her husband went on the run . </P> <P> Her father Max Keenan re-entered Brennan 's life when she and her brother were being threatened by an old acquaintance , who turned out to be Booth 's boss , Deputy Director Kirby . Max evades capture after killing Kirby , and takes Russ into hiding to protect him . Later , Max allows Booth to arrest him in order to improve his relationship with his daughter . At trial , Max is acquitted of murdering Director Kirby ( due in large part to a defense Booth indirectly came up with , positing an alternate theory of the crime in which Temperance was the killer instead , creating reasonable doubt ) , and he begins to rebuild his life . </P> <P> He temporarily works at the Jeffersonian as a guide for children visiting the place and demonstrates his brilliant talent as a former science teacher . However , Brennan is concerned about a convicted felon having access to a lab that investigates crimes . Max also introduces Brennan to her cousin Margaret Whitesell , portrayed by Deschanel 's real - life sister Zooey Deschanel . </P> <P> Brennan is best friends with her coworker , Angela , saying in the 6th - season premiere she loves Angela `` like a sister '' and is going to be an aunt to Hodgins ' and Angela 's newborn child . It is revealed at the end of the season six finale `` The Change in the Game '' that Brennan is pregnant and the father is Booth . </P> <P> In Season 7 , episode 2 `` The Hot Dog in the Competition '' , Brennan and Booth found out they were having a baby girl . Their daughter , Christine Angela Booth ( named for Brennan 's mother and her best friend ) , was born in a stable during the episode `` The Prisoner in the Pipe '' . In the Season 7 finale , `` The Past in the Present '' , key evidence in the death of her friend , Ethan Sawyer , is linked to Brennan . Max convinces her to go on the run along with Christine , saying that if she is arrested , even if she is found innocent , she may never see her daughter again . </P> <P> In Season 8 premiere , it is revealed that while on the run , Brennan was communicating with Angela , via flowers , and eventually used this as a way to communicate with Booth . Despite being on the run , Brennan risks her safety and decides to meet directly with Booth in a hotel room after months of being a single mother . Eventually , they arrest Christopher Pelant , who was the real murderer of Ethan Sawyer , and Brennan is allowed to return to her family . Although Pelant blackmails Booth to prevent him from accepting Brennan 's proposal by threatening to kill five innocent people if Booth accepted , also warning Booth not to give a reason for his refusal , this threat is removed when the team manage to kill Pelant , and Booth and Brennan marry in the Season 9 episode ' The Woman in White ' . </P> <P> In the Season 10 episode , `` The Eye in the Sky '' , Brennan learns that she is pregnant with her and Booth 's second child . </P> <H2> Characterization ( edit ) </H2> <P> Throughout the course of the series , Brennan is portrayed as a straightforward , brilliant anthropologist , who lacks social skills . Her social ineptitude is especially apparent when it comes to sarcasm , metaphors which she often interprets literally , and pop culture jokes and is often the source of comedy in the show . An example of this is when she mistakes Colin Farrell for Will Ferrell . In earlier seasons , she was characterized as straightforward and unable to detect social cues -- she states that Booth once told her that she `` stinks at non-verbal communication '' -- and was well - known within the FBI for being extremely difficult to work with . She began to acknowledge her lack of sensitivity after Booth bluntly told her outright that she was `` bad with people '' in `` A Boy in a Tree '' . Her lack of `` political savvy '' and social skills was also a reason why she was passed over for Dr. Camille Saroyan as head of the Jeffersonian in Season 2 . Other characters have described her as `` no fun '' and `` a rigid traditionalist '' . </P> <P> She had a difficult adolescence , and it is implied , often by Sweets , that her withdrawn social tendencies are a defense mechanism . She also sometimes struggles in identifying and explaining her emotions , and takes comfort in the rationality of her anthropological discipline . Although it has been stated that Brennan was based on a person with Asperger syndrome , this has never been confirmed in the plot of the series . The creator of the series has stated that the character was never labeled as having the syndrome in order to increase the appeal of the show on network television . This influence on her character also helps to explain her extreme rationality in early seasons , as well as some of her social difficulties . Brennan is a self - proclaimed atheist and often points out what she believes to be the irrationality of religious and spiritual beliefs . This has led to more than one argument with Booth , who is a devout Roman Catholic ; he becomes particularly irate when she compares less common religions , such as voodoo , to Christianity . During the Sleepy Hollow crossover episode `` Dead Men Tell No Tales '' , Sleepy Hollow protagonist Ichabod Crane notes that Brennan is so sceptical that she would dismiss the demon Moloch -- the primary antagonist in the first two seasons of Sleepy Hollow -- as nothing more than a tall man with a skin condition , although this does leave him reassured that she will not realise the nature of the secret tomb they have uncovered underneath the White House . </P> <P> Brennan is a bestselling author , who has been on the New York Times Best Seller List for 18 weeks . She is trained in three types of martial arts , has hunting licenses in four states , and has a legally registered gun as well as a diving certificate . She promised to consider becoming a vegetarian after seeing how pigs were slaughtered ( which was also the way her mother had been killed ) . However , in `` The Tough Man in the Tender Chicken '' ( season 5 , episode 6 ) Angela cites health reasons for Brennan 's vegetarian diet . Brennan is also a trained amateur highwire performer , and speaks at least seven other languages , including Spanish , French , Latin , Chinese , Pashto Japanese , Norwegian ( although she says only `` skull '' and avers that , as a forensic anthropologist , this is a word she knows `` in just about every language '' ) , Farsi , and German . She has also admitted to knowing a bit of Russian . She often says she does not `` put much stock in psychology '' and makes a point of noting that Dr. Sweets is not a real scientist as he `` bases his life on the vagary of psychology and emotions '' . </P> <P> Brennan 's personality undergoes significant changes throughout the course of the series . Her thinking becomes less rigid in later seasons , something which is observed by Dr. Gordon Wyatt , who notes that she is now able to distinguish the difference between accuracy and truth . In season 4 , Booth takes her along to his interrogations and helps her learn how to set aside her scientific perspective and relate with the victim 's family and suspects on a more interpersonal level . She is also able to put aside her rationality to support her friends in sometimes irrational pursuits , such as Angela 's quest to raise money to save a pig from slaughter , and to comfort Booth , even using science or quoting directly from the Bible to rationalize his religious beliefs . Her sensitivity and empathy towards others are also much improved , seen quite strongly when she comforts his grandfather , and when she attends a funeral so that the victim 's single mother wo n't be alone . She also displays more `` typical '' human emotions when in extreme stress . One example of this is her fear of snakes in `` The Mummy in the Maze , '' when a girl is in the process of being scared to death in a room , the floor teeming with snakes . This goes against her empirical nature , as , when Booth tells her that the snakes are n't venomous , she states that she is aware , but still refuses to step in the room , causing Booth to carry her on his back . </P> <P> Brennan begins to feel both dissatisfaction and discomfort with her work toward the end of the fifth season . She also sees some futility in her work , stating that no matter how many killers they catch , there will always be more . To help her gain new perspective , she later decides to head up an anthropological expedition to Indonesia for a year to identify some ancient proto - human remains , after mulling it over during the episode . However , 7 months later , she and everyone else return to D.C. in order to save Cam 's job , and they all decide to stay . </P> <P> As season 6 progresses , Brennan must confront her feelings for Booth , whom she rejected in the 100th episode from the previous season . Having returned from 7 months of introspection , she has come to terms with her romantic affection towards him , even admitting that she regretted not having given them a chance together , midway through the season . However , Booth returns from Afghanistan with a new love interest , war correspondent Hannah Burley , whom Brennan befriends . When Hannah rejects Booth 's marriage proposal , Brennan must help him through the emotional fallout . </P> <P> In the second to last episode of season 6 Booth and Brennan had sex , consummating their relationship , and it is revealed in the last few moments of the season finale that as a result , Brennan has become pregnant , with Booth the father . Throughout the episode ( `` The Change in the Game '' ) Brennan has been seen asking Angela questions and making comments that make her seem excited and apprehensive ; when she sees that Booth is happy with the news , she also seems overjoyed . This reflects her earlier desire to become a mother , circa season 4 , as well as her desire that Booth be the father of the baby . </P> <P> In the Season 8 episode `` The Shot in the Dark '' , Brennan is shot while working in the lab late at night . While undergoing emergency surgery , she experiences a vision of meeting with her deceased mother , Christine Brennan . Initially dismissing this as a hallucination , Brennan experiences several more visions throughout the episode . During these discussions , it 's revealed that Brennan 's hyper rationalization originates from the very last piece of advice her mother gave to her ( before going on the run ) which was to use her brain instead of her heart . While that advice enabled Brennan to survive all these years , the vision of her mother explains , it 's now time for Brennan to do more than just survive . </P> <P> Since entering a relationship with and marrying Booth and then having children , the character has undergone development personally and is shown to be a caring wife and protective mother . She would often put aside her own atheistic views and uses her hyper - rationality to justify Booth 's religious beliefs , as shown in season 8 where she references the Bible in order to persuade Booth to forgive his mother and in the season finale where she agrees to a church wedding , rationalizing that she could appreciate the `` beauty '' of the ceremony and its significance to Booth . </P> <H2> Relationships ( edit ) </H2> <P> Brennan has had a number of relatively short relationships , including an ill - fated date with a man who turned out to be a murderer and the re-kindling of a romance with her former thesis supervisor . She has stated that although she does not always feel the need for a committed emotional relationship , she has engaged in casual relationships to `` satisfy biological urges '' . In one episode , she was spending time with two men , one for his intelligence and the other for his sexual skills . In Season 5 , episode `` The Plain in the Prodigy '' , she tells Booth she lost her virginity at the age of 22 and when asked why she waited so long , she said it was because the decision was `` important to her '' . FBI psychologist Lance Sweets postulates in a number of episodes that Brennan 's apprehension over having relationships is largely due in part to the abandonment and abuse she experienced as a teenager after her parents disappeared . It is said that she `` hides '' herself behind a front of hyper - rationalism and she always keeps people at arms ' length , except for those closest to her ( namely FBI partner Seeley Booth and best friend Angela Montenegro ) . After much character growth , Temperance Brennan is now married to her principal love interest of the series Seeley Booth , and they have a daughter ( Season 7 ) and a son together . </P> <H3> Seeley Booth ( edit ) </H3> <P> FBI Special Agent Seeley Booth is Brennan 's husband and partner , and the principal liaison between the Jeffersonian and law enforcement agencies . Prior to their marriage , he is also Brennan 's principal love interest throughout the series . Although his working style initially clashed with Brennan 's , they have since become full - fledged partners . Their compatibility has become one of the central points of the show , with many new characters mistaking them for a couple and co-workers , especially Angela , constantly speculating that they were `` more than partners '' . Booth and Brennan have repeatedly risked their safety to save each other , including when Booth took a bullet meant for Brennan . After Booth rescues Brennan from the corrupt Agent Kenton , Booth lifts her off the hook she was hung on by putting her tied hands around his neck even though he himself was severely injured . In `` Two Bodies in the Lab '' , in season 1 , and in `` The Rocker in the Rinse Cycle '' , in season 5 , Brennan and Booth 's mutual love for Foreigner 's Hot Blooded is mentioned ; Booth even refers to it as ' their song ' in `` The Rocker in the Rinse Cycle '' . Brennan once commented to Dr. Gordon Wyatt ( Stephen Fry ) that she `` ( could n't ) think of anything ( she ) would n't do to help Booth . '' Brennan 's novels are also dedicated to him and the character Special Agent Andy Lister is based on him even though she still denies it . </P> <P> Initially Brennan was mostly dismissive of Booth due to their opposing worldviews and work styles -- which is a source of friction and banter between them . Although she refused to admit it at first , Brennan enjoyed working with him from the beginning , even after their falling out when Booth got her drunk and `` fired '' her , and , in Season 1 , she cajoled him into launching an investigation after finding three bone fragments on a golf course so he could work with the Jeffersonian team on the case despite the fact that the FBI technically had no jurisdiction . She often unknowingly offends him on a number of occasions during the first few seasons with her tactlessness , only realizing after being gently admonished by Angela or another member of the team . She comes to admire his ability to connect with people and read behavioral cues when interrogating suspects after coming to terms with her own lack of social skills . After finding out about his abusive childhood and haunted past in the Army , she also begins to respect him as a person . Booth , who is particularly taciturn in revealing emotions or speaking about his past , begins to open up to and confide in her . Since entering a relationship with ( and eventually marrying ) Booth , she is shown to be extremely supportive of him , even at the expense of her friendship with Angela . Additionally , she put aside her own misgivings several times for Booth 's benefit ; for example , she agrees to have Christine christened into the Catholic church and referenced the Bible when trying to talk Booth into forgiving his mother . </P> <P> Brennan acquired the nickname `` Bones '' from Booth . She initially disliked it but comes to regard it with affection . Booth and his son Parker are the only characters in the show she permits to use it and the former rarely addresses her by her first name or `` Tempe '' . </P> <P> In Season 2 Brennan shot and killed a person for the first time while working on a string of murders connected to serial killer Howard Epps . She was forced to pull the trigger after Epps ' accomplice attacked and injured Booth with a pipe . At the end of the episode she confides in Booth of her conflicted feelings and finds comfort in the fact that Booth understood how she felt . </P> <P> The relationship between Brennan and Booth has often become strained when either partner has a significant other . For example , Booth was quite irritable when Brennan dated Agent Sully , and their relationship was also strained when Booth 's brother Jared was showing an interest in Brennan . Brennan constantly needled Booth while he was dating Tessa . </P> <P> When Brennan decided that she wanted to have a baby , she asked Booth if he would be the sperm donor . He agrees to Brennan 's request at first , but subsequently struggles with the thought of not being involved in the life of his prospective child . Eventually he tells Brennan he can not let her have his child if he is not allowed to be a father to it . Soon thereafter , it is discovered that he has a ( benign ) brain tumour . He has to undergo surgery , and though the surgery is successful , a poor reaction to anesthesia left him in a coma for several days . While in his coma , Brennan reads to him from her new novel , and he has an elaborate dream in which Brennan is his wife and that she is pregnant , and that the staff at the Jeffersonian play the characters in the novel . When he awakens , he initially suffers from amnesia , not recognizing Brennan . </P> <P> Although for the majority of the series Booth and Brennan denied that their relationship was anything more than friendly professionalism , they admitted to Dr. Sweets that they kissed and nearly spent the night together after their very first case together . After this discussion , Booth attempted to convince Brennan to give a relationship a try . However , she declined , telling him that she , unlike him , is not a gambler , and is n't able to take that kind of a chance . They have subsequently attempted to date other people , although the fact that Booth once comments that he regards Brennan as his `` standard '' for other women suggests that he , at least , has not completely moved on . Brennan does admit to her best friend Angela Montenegro that as time has gone on , she is unsure if she wants to keep doing consulting work for the FBI , citing that she is tired of murderers and victims , and is constantly worried that something will happen to Booth and she will be unable to save him . In the climax of Season Five , Brennan and Booth part ways for a year -- he goes to Afghanistan while she leaves for the Maluku Islands in Indonesia -- but they promise to meet , one year from that day , at the Lincoln Memorial . </P> <P> In the beginning of season six ( 7 months later ) , they reunite in the stated place . Booth came back from Afghanistan , along with everyone else from various places , to help save Cam 's job . They all decided to stay . Booth has a serious new girlfriend , Hannah , and despite the hints of her colleagues at Brennan 's unconscious jealousy of their relationship , she vehemently denies feeling uncomfortable with the new situation . Through subsequent episodes her jealousy and resentfulness began becoming more apparent as Hannah and Booth started becoming more serious . In the episode `` The Doctor in the Photo '' , Brennan realizes she is in love with Booth and confronts him , but she is let down when Booth says that he loves Hannah and she is not a `` consolation prize '' , prompting Brennan to conclude that she has missed her chance , later reflecting that she should move on . In episode 10 of the sixth season `` The Body in the Bag '' , Booth tells his girlfriend about the incident , stating that it ( his love for Temperance ) was all in the past and whatever he felt , he does not feel it anymore , except for Hannah . However it was clear in the following episode that he still has feelings for Brennan . </P> <P> Despite her apparent resolve to move on , Brennan later showed sorrow when her father noted that he always thought she and Booth would end up together . During a subsequent case involving a polygamist who would spend the night with his first wife on the night he was scheduled to sleep alone , Booth commented that , while you can love several people , there is only ever one person you love the most , prompting Brennan to ask what happens when you push that person away , something Booth answered saying that it never truly leaves , adding further weight to the implication that he still has feelings for Brennan . Following Hannah 's departure , the two have begun to reconnect , to the point that , during a case that saw the two trapped in an elevator during a blackout for several hours , Booth and Brennan admitted that they are each interested in a relationship , but require more time to sort out their own feelings before they make such a commitment . </P> <P> In episode 22 of season 6 , `` The Hole in the Heart '' , which saw the death of Vincent Nigel - Murray ( Brennan 's favorite intern ) at the hands of renegade sniper Jacob Broadsky , Booth has Brennan stay at his apartment for her safety . Later that night , Brennan , still overcome with shock and grief over Vincent 's death , goes into Booth 's bedroom and they talk about the events of that day , and then allows Booth to hold her in bed . It is implied in the following day that they had sex . In the last scene of the season 6 finale , `` The Change in the Game '' , after the birth of Angela and Hodgins ' son , Brennan tells Booth that she is pregnant and that he is the father . </P> <P> At the start of Season 7 , a very pregnant Brennan and Booth are a couple but are going back and forth between apartments . Booth suggests that they should have their own place , whereas Brennan wants Booth to move into her apartment . It causes a minor rift between them , but is resolved when Booth admits why he wants to move into a new house and Brennan having some time to think over it says it 's a good idea because she 'd need him practically , emotionally and sexually . In episode 6 , `` The Crack in the Code , '' they decide to buy a two - story house in the suburbs -- which they jokingly called `` The Mighty Hut '' -- that Booth found at a police auction and renovate it , ( according to a mailed check sent to Brennan in `` The Heiress in the Hill '' , in season 9 , the `` Mighty Hut '' 's address is `` 1297 Janus Street , Washington DC , 20002 '' ) . In episode 7 , `` The Prisoner in the Pipe '' , Brennan goes into labor inside a prison just as she discovers who killed in an inmate there and Booth rushes her out with the intention to take her to the nearest hospital , but they both know she wo n't make it in time . This leads them to driving to an inn close to the prison . At first , they are rejected and are told to leave , but after some desperate pleading from an agonized Brennan , the two of them are led to a stall where she gives birth to their daughter , Christine Angela Booth ( named after Temperance 's mother , Christine Brennan , and Temperance 's best friend Angela Montenegro ) . Some time after the delivery , Temperance and Seeley both go back to their home where they celebrate with their friends from the Jeffersonian , who brought dinners that would last a few nights as well as a few baby supplies . In `` The Past in the Present '' , Brennan becomes the prime suspect in the murder of her schizophrenic friend , Ethan Sawyer , after supposedly threatening to kill Christine . Max advises Brennan to get off the grid and go into hiding , but she and Booth do not follow up at this suggestion . However , at the end of the episode , after Christine is christened in a Catholic church , it is revealed Brennan decided to take her father 's advice and flee with her daughter until her name is cleared . Just before Brennan flees town with Christine , she tells Booth she loves him and not just because of their daughter . After she is cleared of Sawyer 's murder , Brennan , Booth and Christine resume their family life . </P> <P> At the end of Season 8 , Brennan finally decides to marry Booth . However , their plans are ruined when a vengeful Christopher Pelant blackmails Booth , threatening to kill five random people if Booth marries Brennan . Booth calls off the wedding , but does not explain the real reason to Brennan . Brennan is devastated but pretends to be fine with this . In the season 9 premiere , Brennan fears that since Booth turned down her proposal , she fears that the love from their life is fading . After talking with bartender Aldo Clemens , a former priest and Army chaplain Booth confessed to , she realizes that it was uncharacteristic for Booth to suddenly cancel the wedding as he believed in marriage and that he likely had a legitimate reason to do so . Despite her colleagues ' anger at Booth , she decides to stay with him , telling him that she understands that he has his reasons and has faith that he will resolve the issue . In the episode 4 , `` The Sense in the Sacrifice '' , after Booth singlehandedly tracks Pelant down through an abandoned building and kills him with a single gunshot , he reveals to her that Pelant had blackmailed him . Pelant had threatened to kill five innocent people if Booth continued with the wedding or went to the police or FBI . At the end of the episode he proposes and she happily accepts ; unknown to them , Caroline , Angela and Hodgins witnessed it via the security cameras . In `` The Woman in White '' , Booth and Brennan marry at a small garden ceremony outside the Jeffersonian . </P> <P> Their infant son Hank Jr. ( named after Booth 's grandfather ) was born off - screen sometime after season 10 and before the beginning of season 11 . </P> <H3> Tim `` Sully '' Sullivan ( edit ) </H3> <P> Brennan had a brief relationship with FBI Agent Tim Sullivan ( Eddie McClintock ) , also known as Sully , whom she met while on a case when Booth was in therapy due to his grief - induced rage over his self - perceived role in the death of serial killer Howard Epps . Sully asked Dr. Brennan out on a date after their case was completed , and they began a relationship . Their relationship ended , however , when Sully decided to sail a boat down to the Caribbean , and Brennan declined to leave the Jeffersonian to go with him despite Angela trying to persuade her to follow him ; psychiatrist Doctor Gordon Wyatt ( Stephen Fry ) speculated that this was due to Brennan being unable to live a life without purpose . Despite Dr. Wyatt 's original perception as to why she stayed , there exist strong indications , especially through Angela 's observations of the situation , that the real reason she stayed was because of Booth . Sully returns in Season 12 . </P> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ Goldman , Eric , `` Digging Up Secrets With the Cast of Bones '' , IGN , May 31 , 2007 .
