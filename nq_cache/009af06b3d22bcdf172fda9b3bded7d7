She drew upon her own childhood experiences in rural Prince Edward Island , Canada . Montgomery used a photograph of Evelyn Nesbit , which she had clipped from New York 's Metropolitan Magazine and put on the wall of her bedroom , as the model for the face of Anne Shirley and a reminder of her `` youthful idealism and spirituality . '' </P> <P> Montgomery was also inspired by the `` formula Ann '' orphan stories ( called such because they followed such a predictable formula ) which were popular at the time and distinguished her character by spelling her name with an extra `` e '' . She based other characters , such as Gilbert Blythe , in part on people she knew . She said she wrote the novel in the twilight of the day , while sitting at her window and overlooking the fields of Cavendish . </P> <H2> Plot summary ( edit ) </H2> Anne attacks Gilbert <P> Anne Shirley , a young orphan from the fictional community of Bolingbroke , Nova Scotia ( based upon the real community of New London , Prince Edward Island ) , is sent to live with Marilla and Matthew Cuthbert , siblings in their fifties and sixties , after a childhood spent in strangers ' homes and orphanages . Marilla and Matthew had originally decided to adopt a boy from the orphanage to help Matthew run their farm at Green Gables , which is set in the fictional town of Avonlea . Through a misunderstanding , the orphanage sends Anne instead . </P> <P> Anne is highly imaginative , eager to please and quite dramatic at times . However , she is defensive about her appearance , despising her red hair and pale , thin frame . She is often quite talkative , especially when it comes to describing her fantasies and dreams . At first , stern and sharp Marilla says Anne must return to the orphanage , but after much observation and considering , along with Matthew 's strong liking to Anne , she decides to let her stay . </P> <P> As a child of imagination , Anne takes much joy in life and adapts quickly , thriving in the close - knit farming village . Her imagination and talkativeness soon brighten up Green Gables . </P> <P> The book recounts Anne 's adventures in making a home : the country school where she quickly excels in her studies ; her friendship with Diana Barry , the girl living next door ( her best or `` bosom friend '' as Anne fondly calls her ) ; her budding literary ambitions ; and her rivalry with her classmate Gilbert Blythe , who teases her about her red hair . For that , he earns her instant hatred , although he apologizes many times . As time passes , Anne realizes she no longer hates Gilbert but can not bring herself to speak to him . </P> <P> The book also follows Anne 's adventures with her new - found friends . Episodes include her play - time with her friends Diana , a calm girl named Jane Andrews and a good - natured but often hysterical girl called Ruby Gillis , and her run - ins with the unpleasant Pye sisters Gertie and Josie ; and domestic mishaps such as dyeing her hair green while intending to dye it black , and accidentally getting Diana drunk by giving her what she thought was raspberry cordial but turned out to be currant wine . </P> <P> At sixteen , Anne goes to Queen 's Academy to earn a teaching license , along with Gilbert , Ruby , Josie , Jane , and several other students , excluding Diana much to Anne 's dismay . She obtains her license in one year instead of the usual two and wins the Avery Scholarship for the top student in English . Her attainment of this scholarship would allow her to pursue a Bachelor of Arts ( B.A. ) degree at the fictional Redmond College ( based on the real Dalhousie University ) on the mainland in Nova Scotia . </P> <P> Near the end of the book however , tragedy strikes when Matthew dies of a heart attack after learning that all of his and Marilla 's money has been lost in a bank failure . Out of devotion to Marilla and Green Gables , Anne gives up the scholarship to stay at home and help Marilla , whose eyesight is failing . She plans to teach at the Carmody school , the nearest school available , and return to Green Gables on weekends . In an act of friendship , Gilbert Blythe gives up his teaching position at the Avonlea School to work at the White Sands School instead , knowing that Anne wants to stay close to Marilla after Matthew 's death . After this kind act , Anne and Gilbert 's friendship is cemented , and Anne looks forward to what life will bring next . </P> <H2> Characters ( edit ) </H2> Diana and Anne <P> Green Gables household : </P> <Ul> <Li> Anne Shirley : An imaginative , talkative , red - headed orphan who comes to live with Matthew Cuthbert and Marilla Cuthbert . Anne is very sensitive and is very insecure about the color of her hair . She exhibits categorical interest in everything romantic . </Li> <Li> Marilla Cuthbert : Matthew 's sister , she is an austere but fair woman who objects to Anne 's imaginative , unusual conduct on the grounds of its being part of the same group of behavioral misconducts that bring about dereliction of responsibility or produce a disrespectful personal image . Life experience with Anne , however , profoundly affects Marilla 's ways ; in a very early instance , she experiences first - hand how worthless a confession under duress could be . Although conservative and austere , she is fond of Anne and has the glimmerings of a sense of humor . </Li> <Li> Matthew Cuthbert : Marilla 's brother , he is an overly shy , albeit kind , old man with a lumbering frame and above - average strength . Matthew takes a liking to Anne from the start and the two become fast friends . Because Marilla has primary responsibility for rearing the girl , he has no qualms about `` spoiling '' her and indulging her in pretty clothes and other frivolities . </Li> </Ul> <P> Anne 's schoolmates : </P> <Ul> <Li> Diana Barry : Anne 's bosom friend and a kindred spirit . Anne and Diana become best friends from the moment they meet . She is the only girl of Anne 's age who lives close to Green Gables . Anne admires Diana for being pretty and for her amiable disposition . Diana lacks Anne 's powerful imagination but is a loyal friend . </Li> <Li> Gilbert Blythe : A handsome , smart , witty and chivalrous classmate who has a crush on Anne the moment he sees her . Unaware of Anne 's near - pathological sensitivity about her red hair , he tries to get Anne 's attention by holding her braid and calling her `` Carrots ! '' Anne 's explosively hostile reaction only causes Gilbert to be more smitten . He makes several attempts to apologize , the failure of all of which do not seem to mar his admiration . He attempts to apologize one last time when he saves Anne from drowning ; Anne crassly rebuffs this attempt , only to regret it almost immediately . Years later , he gives up his job offer of teaching at the Avonlea school so that Anne may live at Green Gables , upon which the two reconcile and become good friends . </Li> <Li> Ruby Gillis : Another of Anne 's friends . Having several `` grown up '' sisters , Ruby loves to share her knowledge of beaus with her friends . Ruby is portrayed as traditionally beautiful with long golden hair . She is hysterical and suffers from consumption ( tuberculosis ) . </Li> <Li> Jane Andrews : One of Anne 's friends from school , she is plain and sensible . She does well enough academically to join Anne 's class at Queen 's . </Li> <Li> Josie Pye : A classmate generally disliked by the other girls ( as are her siblings ) , Josie is vain , dishonest , and jealous of Anne 's popularity . </Li> </Ul> <P> Avonlea 's locals : </P> <Ul> <Li> Mrs. Rachel Lynde : A neighbour of Matthew and Marilla , Mrs. Lynde is an amalgamation of vices and virtues . She is industrious and helpful , and does work for the church , yet she is famous for being nosy and condescending . Although she and Anne start off the wrong foot , owing to Mrs. Lynde 's obnoxious criticism and Anne 's lack of tolerance for such , as well as her temper , they soon become quite close . Mrs. Lynde is married and has raised ten children , although her husband , Thomas Lynde , is mentioned briefly and never speaks . </Li> <Li> Mr. Phillips : Anne 's first teacher at Avonlea , Mr. Phillips is unpopular with students , because of his boring and crude ways . In Anne 's case , he continually misspells her name ( without the `` E '' ) and punishes only her among twelve pupils who arrive late . He is described as lacking discipline , and `` courts '' one of his pupils openly ( this was less frowned upon then as opposed to more contemporary times ) . </Li> <Li> Miss Muriel Stacy : Anne 's energetic replacement teacher . Her warm and sympathetic nature appeals to her students , but Avonlea 's conservative parents disapprove of her liberal teaching methods . She forms a special relationship with Anne , who views her as a mentor . Miss Stacy encourages Anne to develop her character and intellect and helps prepare her for the entrance exam at Queen 's Academy , where she finishes in a tie for first with Gilbert Blythe . </Li> <Li> Reverend and Mrs. Allan : The minister and his wife also befriend Anne , with Mrs. Allan becoming particularly close . She is described as pretty . </Li> <Li> Mr. & Mrs. Barry : Diana 's parents . Mr. Barry farms . Near the end of the book , he offers to rent some tracts to help out Anne and Marilla , after Matthew 's passing . Mrs. Barry has a severe personality , expecting her children to follow strict rules . After Anne accidentally gets Diana drunk , Mrs. Barry rejects the girl , forbidding Diana to have anything to do with Anne . This sanction is repealed after Anne saves Minnie May . </Li> <Li> Minnie May Barry : Diana 's baby sister , whose life is saved by Anne when she comes down with croup . </Li> </Ul> <P> Others : </P> <Ul> <Li> Miss Josephine Barry : Diana 's great - aunt . Initially portrayed in a negative light , she is quickly charmed by Anne 's imagination , and eventually invites her and Diana to tea . She refers to Anne as `` the Anne - girl '' and even sends Anne beaded slippers as a Christmas present . </Li> <Li> Mrs Hammond : Anne had lived with her for a portion of her pre-Green - Gables life . She was very mean as a result of her husband \u2032 s death . Anne was treated more as a maid in her home than as a daughter or friend . </Li> </Ul> <H2> Related works ( edit ) </H2> <P> Based on the popularity of her first book , Montgomery wrote a series of sequels to continue the story of her heroine Anne Shirley .
