It is located on the southeast coast of the Persian Gulf and is the capital of the Emirate of Dubai , one of the seven emirates that make up the country . Abu Dhabi and Dubai are the only two emirates to have veto power over critical matters of national importance in the country 's Federal Supreme Council . The city of Dubai is located on the emirate 's northern coastline and heads the Dubai - Sharjah - Ajman metropolitan area . Dubai will host World Expo 2020 . </P> <P> Dubai emerged as a global city and business hub of the Middle East . It is also a major transport hub for passengers and cargo . By the 1960s , Dubai 's economy was based on revenues from trade and , to a smaller extent , oil exploration concessions , but oil was not discovered until 1966 . Oil revenue first started to flow in 1969 . Dubai 's oil revenue helped accelerate the early development of the city , but its reserves are limited and production levels are low : today , less than 5 % of the emirate 's revenue comes from oil . </P> <P> The Emirate 's Western - style model of business drives its economy with the main revenues now coming from tourism , aviation , real estate , and financial services . Dubai was recently named the best destination for Muslim travellers by Salam Standard . Dubai has recently attracted world attention through many innovative large construction projects and sports events . The city has become iconic for its skyscrapers and high - rise buildings , in particular the world 's tallest building , the Burj Khalifa . Dubai has been criticised for human rights violations concerning the city 's largely South Asian and Filipino workforce . Dubai 's property market experienced a major deterioration in 2008 -- 09 following the financial crisis of 2007 -- 08 , but the emirate 's economy has made a return to growth , with a projected 2015 budget surplus . </P> <P> As of 2012 , Dubai was the 22nd most expensive city in the world and the most expensive city in the Middle East . In 2014 , Dubai 's hotel rooms were rated as the second most expensive in the world , after Geneva . In 2013 , U.S. global consulting firm Mercer rated Dubai the best place to live in the Middle East . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Etymology </Li> <Li> 2 History <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Pre-oil Dubai </Li> <Li> 2.2 Oil era </Li> <Li> 2.3 Reaching the UAE 's Act of Union </Li> <Li> 2.4 Modern Dubai </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Geography </Li> <Li> 4 Climate </Li> <Li> 5 Governance and politics <Ul> <Li> 5.1 Law enforcement </Li> <Li> 5.2 Sharia laws </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 6 Human rights </Li> <Li> 7 Demographics <Ul> <Li> 7.1 Ethnicity and languages </Li> <Li> 7.2 Religion <Ul> <Li> 7.2. 1 Minorities </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 8 Economy <Ul> <Li> 8.1 Tourism and retail <Ul> <Li> 8.1. 1 Ski Dubai </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 8.2 Expo 2020 </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 9 Cityscape <Ul> <Li> 9.1 Architecture <Ul> <Li> 9.1. 1 Burj Al Arab </Li> <Li> 9.1. 2 Burj Khalifa </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 9.2 Artificial Islands <Ul> <Li> 9.2. 1 Palm Jumeirah </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 9.3 Dubai Miracle Garden </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 10 Transportation <Ul> <Li> 10.1 Road </Li> <Li> 10.2 Air </Li> <Li> 10.3 Metro rail </Li> <Li> 10.4 Palm Jumeirah Monorail </Li> <Li> 10.5 Tram </Li> <Li> 10.6 High speed rail </Li> <Li> 10.7 Waterways </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 11 Culture <Ul> <Li> 11.1 Food <Ul> <Li> 11.1. 1 Dubai Food Festival </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 11.2 Entertainment </Li> <Li> 11.3 Dubai Shopping Festival </Li> <Li> 11.4 Media </Li> <Li> 11.5 Sports <Ul> <Li> 11.5. 1 Cricket </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 11.6 Dress code </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 12 Education </Li> <Li> 13 Healthcare </Li> <Li> 14 Notable people </Li> <Li> 15 International relations <Ul> <Li> 15.1 Twin towns and sister cities </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 16 See also </Li> <Li> 17 References </Li> <Li> 18 Further reading </Li> <Li> 19 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Etymology ( edit ) </H2> <P> Many theories have been proposed as to the origin of the word `` Dubai '' . One theory suggests the word was used to describe the souq , which was similar to the souq in Ba . An Arabic proverb says `` Daba Dubai '' ( Arabic : \u062f\u0628\u0627 \u062f\u0628\u064a \u200e ) , meaning `` They came with a lot of money . '' According to Fedel Handhal , a scholar on the UAE 's history and culture , the word Dubai may have come from the word daba ( Arabic : \u062f\u0628\u0627 \u200e ) ( a past tense derivative of yadub ( Arabic : \u064a\u062f\u0628 \u200e ) , which means `` to creep '' ) , referring to the slow flow of Dubai Creek inland . The poet and scholar Ahmad Mohammad Obaid traces it to the same word , but to its alternative meaning of `` baby locust '' ( Arabic : \u062c\u0631\u0627\u062f \u200e ) due to the abundant nature of locusts in the area before settlement . An inhabitant or native of the city is a Dubaian . </P> <H2> History ( edit ) </H2> Main articles : History of Dubai and Timeline of Dubai Typical scene in old Dubai , Old District of Al Bastakiya <P> Although stone tools have been found at many archaeological sites , little is known about the UAE 's early inhabitants as only a few settlements have been found . Many ancient towns in the area were trading centres between the Eastern and Western worlds . The remnants of an ancient mangrove swamp , dated at 7000 BC , were discovered during the construction of sewer lines near Dubai Internet City . The area was covered with sand about 5,000 years ago as the coast retreated inland , becoming part of the city 's present coastline . Pre-Islamic ceramics have been found from the 3rd and 4th centuries . Prior to the introduction of Islam to the area , the people in this region worshiped Bajir ( or Bajar ) . After the spread of Islam in the region , the Umayyad Caliph of the eastern Islamic world invaded south - east Arabia and drove out the Sassanians . Excavations by the Dubai Museum in the region of Al - Jumayra ( Jumeirah ) found several artefacts from the Umayyad period . </P> <P> The earliest recorded mention of Dubai is in 1095 in the Book of Geography by the Andalusian - Arab geographer Abu Abdullah al - Bakri . The Venetian pearl merchant Gasparo Balbi visited the area in 1580 and mentioned Dubai ( Dibei ) for its pearling industry . </P> <P> Dubai is thought to have been established as a fishing village in the early 18th century and was , by 1822 , a town of some 7 -- 800 members of the Baniyas tribe and subject to the rule of Sheikh Tahnoon of Abu Dhabi . </P> <P> In 1833 , following tribal feuding , members of the Al Bu Falasa tribe seceded from Abu Dhabi and established themselves in Dubai . The exodus from Abu Dhabi was led by Ubaid bin Saeed and Maktum bin Butti who became joint leaders of Dubai until Ubaid died in 1836 , leaving Maktum to establish the Maktoum dynasty . </P> <P> Dubai signed the first treaty of Perpetual Maritime Truce in 1820 along with other Trucial States , which was followed by a further treaty in 1853 . It also -- like its neighbours on the Trucial Coast -- entered into an exclusivity agreement in which the United Kingdom took responsibility for the emirate 's security in 1892 . </P> <P> Two catastrophes struck the town during the 1800s . First , in 1841 , a smallpox epidemic broke out in the Bur Dubai locality , forcing residents to relocate east to Deira . Then , in 1894 , fire swept through Deira , burning down most homes . However , the town 's geographical location continued to attract traders and merchants from around the region . The emir of Dubai was keen to attract foreign traders and lowered trade tax brackets , which lured traders away from Sharjah and Bandar Lengeh , the region 's main trade hubs at the time . Persian merchants naturally looked across to the Arab shore of the Persian Gulf finally making their homes in Dubai . They continued to trade with Lingah , however , as do many of the dhows in Dubai Creek today , and they named their district Bastakiya , after the Bastak region in southern Persia . </P> <H3> Pre-oil Dubai ( edit ) </H3> Typical Bastakiya street in Deira <P> Dubai 's geographical proximity to Iran made it an important trade location . The town of Dubai was an important port of call for foreign tradesmen , chiefly those from Iran , many of whom eventually settled in the town . By the beginning of the 20th century , it was an important port . </P> <P> Dubai was known for its pearl exports until the 1930s ; the pearl trade was damaged irreparably by the Great Depression in the 1930s and the innovation of cultured pearls . With the collapse of the pearling industry , Dubai fell into a deep depression and many residents starved or migrated to other parts of the Persian Gulf . </P> <P> In the early days since its inception , Dubai was constantly at odds with Abu Dhabi . In 1947 , a border dispute between Dubai and Abu Dhabi on the northern sector of their mutual border escalated into war . Arbitration by the British and the creation of a buffer frontier running south eastwards from the coast at Ras Hasian resulted in a temporary cessation of hostilities . </P> <P> Despite a lack of oil , Dubai 's ruler from 1958 , Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum , used revenue from trading activities to build infrastructure . Private companies were established to build and operate infrastructure , including electricity , telephone services and both the ports and airport operators . An airport of sorts ( a runway built on salt flats ) was established in Dubai in the 1950s and , in 1959 , the emirate 's first hotel , the Airlines Hotel , was constructed . This was followed by the Ambassador and Carlton Hotels in 1968 . </P> The Al Ras district in Deira , Dubai in the 1960s <P> On 7 April 1961 , the Dubai - based MV Dara , a five thousand ton British flagged vessel that plied the route between Basra ( Iraq ) , Kuwait and Bombay ( India ) , was caught in unusually high winds off Dubai . Early the next morning in heavy seas off Umm al - Quwain , an explosion tore out the second class cabins and started fires . The captain gave the order to abandon ship but two lifeboats capsized and a second explosion occurred . A flotilla of small boats from Dubai , Sharjah , Ajman and Umm al - Quwain picked up survivors but in all 238 lives were lost in the disaster . </P> <P> In 1962 the British Political Agent noted that `` Many new houses and blocks of offices and flats are being built ... the Ruler is determined , against advice ( from the British ) to press on with the construction of a jet airport ... More and more European and Arab firms are opening up and the future looks bright . '' </P> <P> In 1962 , with expenditure on infrastructure projects already approaching levels some thought imprudent , Sheikh Rashid approached his brother in law , the Ruler of Qatar , for a loan to build the first bridge crossing Dubai 's creek . This crossing was finished in May 1963 and was paid for by a toll levied on the crossing from the Dubai side of the creek to the Deira side . </P> <P> BOAC was originally reluctant to start regular flights between Bombay and Dubai , fearing a lack of demand for seats . However , by the time the asphalt runway of Dubai Airport was constructed in 1965 , opening Dubai to both regional and long haul traffic , a number of foreign airlines were competing for landing rights . In 1970 a new airport terminal building was constructed which included Dubai 's first duty - free shops . </P> <H3> Oil era ( edit ) </H3> View of Downtown Dubai from Burj Khalifa <P> After years of exploration following large finds in neighbouring Abu Dhabi , oil was eventually discovered in territorial waters off Dubai in 1966 , albeit in far smaller quantities . The first field was named ' Fateh ' or ' good fortune ' . This led the emirate to grant concessions to international oil companies , thus leading to a massive influx of foreign workers , mainly Asians and Middle easterners . Between 1968 and 1975 the city 's population grew by over 300 % . </P> <P> As part of the infrastructure for pumping and transporting oil from the Fateh field , located offshore of the Jebel Ali area of Dubai , a number of 50,000 gallon storage tanks were built , known locally as ' Kazzans ' , by welding them together on the beach and then digging them out and floating them to drop onto the seabed at the Fateh field . These were constructed by the Chicago Bridge and Iron Company , which gave the beach its local name ( Chicago Beach ) until the Chicago Beach Hotel was demolished and replaced by the Jumeirah Beach Hotel in the late 1990s . </P> <P> Dubai had already embarked on a period of infrastructural development and expansion . Oil revenue , flowing from 1969 onwards supported a period of growth with Sheikh Rashid embarking on a policy of building infrastructure and a diversified trading economy before the emirate 's limited reserves were depleted . Oil accounted for 24 % of GDP in 1990 , but had reduced to 7 % of GDP by 2004 . </P> <P> Critically , one of the first major projects Sheikh Rashid embarked upon when oil revenue started to flow was the construction of Port Rashid , a deep water free port constructed by British company Halcrow . Originally intended to be a four - berth port , it was extended to sixteen berths as construction was ongoing . The project was an outstanding success , with shipping queuing to access the new facilities . The port was inaugurated on 5 October 1972 , although its berths were each pressed into use as soon as they had been built . Port Rashid was to be further expanded in 1975 to add a further 35 berths before the larger port of Jebel Ali was constructed . </P> <P> Port Rashid was the first of a swath of projects designed to create a modern trading infrastructure , including roads , bridges , schools and hospitals . </P> <H3> Reaching the UAE 's Act of union ( edit ) </H3> Adi Bitar in a meeting with Sheiks Rashid Al Maktoum , Mohammad Al Maktoum , and Maktoum Al Maktoum in Dubai , 1968 <P> Dubai and the other ' trucial states ' had long been a British protectorate where the British took care of foreign policy and defence , as well as arbitrating between the rulers of the Eastern Gulf . This was to change with PM Harold Wilson 's announcement , on 16 January 1968 , that all British troops were to be withdrawn from ' East of Aden ' . The decision was to pitch the coastal emirates , together with Qatar and Bahrain , into fevered negotiations to fill the political vacuum that the British withdrawal would leave behind . </P> <P> The principle of union was first agreed between the ruler of Abu Dhabi , Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan , and Sheikh Rashid of Dubai on 18 February 1968 meeting in an encampment at Argoub Al Sedirah , near Al Semeih , a desert stop between the two emirates . The two agreed to work towards bringing the other emirates , including Qatar and Bahrain , into the union . Over the next two years , negotiations and meetings of the rulers followed - often stormy - as a form of union was thrashed out . The nine - state union was never to recover from the October 1969 meeting where heavy - handed British intervention resulted in a walk - out by Qatar and Ras Al Khaimah . Bahrain and Qatar were to drop out of talks , leaving six emirates to agree on union on 18 July 1971 . </P> <P> On 2 December 1971 , Dubai , together with Abu Dhabi , Sharjah , Ajman , Umm al - Quwain and Fujairah joined in the Act of Union to form the United Arab Emirates . The seventh emirate , Ras Al Khaimah , joined the UAE on 10 February 1972 , following Iran 's annexation of the RAK - claimed Tunbs islands . </P> <P> In 1973 , Dubai joined the other emirates to adopt a uniform currency : the UAE dirham . In that same year , the prior monetary union with Qatar was dissolved and the UAE Dirham was introduced throughout the Emirates . </P> <H3> Modern Dubai ( edit ) </H3> Dubai Palm Jumeirah and Marina in 2011 <P> During the 1970s , Dubai continued to grow from revenues generated from oil and trade , even as the city saw an influx of immigrants fleeing the Lebanese civil war . Border disputes between the emirates continued even after the formation of the UAE ; it was only in 1979 that a formal compromise was reached that ended disagreements . The Jebel Ali port was established in 1979 . JAFZA ( Jebel Ali Free Zone ) was built around the port in 1985 to provide foreign companies unrestricted import of labour and export capital . Dubai airport and the aviation industry also continued to grow . </P> <P> The Gulf War of 1990 had a negative financial effect on the city , as depositors withdrew their money and traders withdrew their trade , but subsequently , the city recovered in a changing political climate and thrived . Later in the 1990s , many foreign trading communities -- first from Kuwait , during the Gulf War , and later from Bahrain , during the Shia unrest -- moved their businesses to Dubai . Dubai provided refuelling bases to allied forces at the Jebel Ali Free Zone during the Gulf War , and again during the 2003 Invasion of Iraq . Large increases in oil prices after the Gulf War encouraged Dubai to continue to focus on free trade and tourism . </P> <H2> Geography ( edit ) </H2> Main article : Geography of Dubai See also : List of communities in Dubai Play media This time - lapse video shows the rate of Dubai 's growth at one frame per year from 2000 through 2011 . In the false - color satellite images making up the video , bare desert is tan , plant - covered land is red , water is black and urban areas are silver . Sand dunes on the city outskirts Abras across the Dubai Creek <P> Dubai is situated on the Persian Gulf coast of the United Arab Emirates and is roughly at sea level ( 16 m or 52 ft above ) . The emirate of Dubai shares borders with Abu Dhabi in the south , Sharjah in the northeast , and the Sultanate of Oman in the southeast . Hatta , a minor exclave of the emirate , is surrounded on three sides by Oman and by the emirates of Ajman ( in the west ) and Ras Al Khaimah ( in the north ) . The Persian Gulf borders the western coast of the emirate . Dubai is positioned at 25 \u00b0 16 \u2032 11 '' N 55 \u00b0 18 \u2032 34 '' E \ufeff / \ufeff 25.2697 \u00b0 N 55.3095 \u00b0 E \ufeff / 25.2697 ; 55.3095 and covers an area of 1,588 sq mi ( 4,110 km ) , which represents a significant expansion beyond its initial 1,500 sq mi ( 3,900 km ) designation due to land reclamation from the sea . </P> <P> Dubai lies directly within the Arabian Desert . However , the topography of Dubai is significantly different from that of the southern portion of the UAE in that much of Dubai 's landscape is highlighted by sandy desert patterns , while gravel deserts dominate much of the southern region of the country . The sand consists mostly of crushed shell and coral and is fine , clean and white . East of the city , the salt - crusted coastal plains , known as sabkha , give way to a north - south running line of dunes . Farther east , the dunes grow larger and are tinged red with iron oxide . </P> <P> The flat sandy desert gives way to the Western Hajar Mountains , which run alongside Dubai 's border with Oman at Hatta . The Western Hajar chain has an arid , jagged and shattered landscape , whose mountains rise to about 1,300 metres ( 4,265 feet ) in some places . Dubai has no natural river bodies or oases ; however , Dubai does have a natural inlet , Dubai Creek , which has been dredged to make it deep enough for large vessels to pass through . Dubai also has multiple gorges and waterholes , which dot the base of the Western Al Hajar mountains . A vast sea of sand dunes covers much of southern Dubai and eventually leads into the desert known as The Empty Quarter . Seismically , Dubai is in a very stable zone -- the nearest seismic fault line , the Zagros Fault , is 200 kilometres ( 124 miles ) from the UAE and is unlikely to have any seismic impact on Dubai . Experts also predict that the possibility of a tsunami in the region is minimal because the Persian Gulf waters are not deep enough to trigger a tsunami . </P> <P> The sandy desert surrounding the city supports wild grasses and occasional date palms . Desert hyacinths grow in the sabkha plains east of the city , while acacia and ghaf trees grow in the flat plains within the proximity of the Western Al Hajar mountains . Several indigenous trees such as the date palm and neem as well as imported trees such as the eucalypts grow in Dubai 's natural parks . The houbara bustard , striped hyena , caracal , desert fox , falcon and Arabian oryx are common in Dubai 's desert . Dubai is on the migration path between Europe , Asia and Africa , and more than 320 migratory bird species pass through the emirate in spring and autumn . The waters of Dubai are home to more than 300 species of fish , including the hammour . The typical marine life off the Dubai coast includes tropical fish , jellyfish , coral , dugong , dolphins , whales and sharks . Various types of turtles can also be found in the area including the hawksbill turtle and green turtle , which are listed as endangered species . </P> <P> Dubai Creek runs northeast - southwest through the city . The eastern section of the city forms the locality of Deira and is flanked by the emirate of Sharjah in the east and the town of Al Aweer in the south . The Dubai International Airport is located south of Deira , while the Palm Deira is located north of Deira in the Persian Gulf . Much of Dubai 's real - estate boom is concentrated to the west of Dubai Creek , on the Jumeirah coastal belt . Port Rashid , Jebel Ali , Burj Al Arab , the Palm Jumeirah and theme - based free - zone clusters such as Business Bay are all located in this section . Dubai is notable for sculpted artificial island complexes including the Palm Islands and The World archipelago . </P> <H2> Climate ( edit ) </H2> Main article : Climate of Dubai <P> Dubai has a hot desert climate . Summers in Dubai are extremely hot , windy , and humid , with an average high around 41 \u00b0 C ( 106 \u00b0 F ) and overnight lows around 30 \u00b0 C ( 86 \u00b0 F ) in the hottest month , August . Most days are sunny throughout the year . Winters are warm with an average high of 24 \u00b0 C ( 75 \u00b0 F ) and overnight lows of 14 \u00b0 C ( 57 \u00b0 F ) in January , the coldest month . Precipitation , however , has been increasing in the last few decades , with accumulated rain reaching 94.3 mm ( 3.71 in ) per year . Dubai summers are also known for the very high humidity level , which can make it very uncomfortable for many with exceptionally high dewpoints in summer . The highest recorded temperature in the UAE is 52.1 \u00b0 C ( 126 \u00b0 F ) , reached in July 2002 . </P> <Table> <Tr> <Th_colspan=\"14\"> ( hide ) Climate data for Dubai </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Month </Th> <Th> Jan </Th> <Th> Feb </Th> <Th> Mar </Th> <Th> Apr </Th> <Th> May </Th> <Th> Jun </Th> <Th> Jul </Th> <Th> Aug </Th> <Th> Sep </Th> <Th> Oct </Th> <Th> Nov </Th> <Th> Dec </Th> <Th> Year </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Record high \u00b0 C ( \u00b0 F ) </Th> <Td> 31.8 ( 89.2 ) </Td> <Td> 37.9 ( 100.2 ) </Td> <Td> 41.3 ( 106.3 ) </Td> <Td> 43.5 ( 110.3 ) </Td> <Td> 47.0 ( 116.6 ) </Td> <Td> 48.5 ( 119.3 ) </Td> <Td> 52.1 ( 125.8 ) </Td> <Td> 51.3 ( 124.3 ) </Td> <Td> 45.1 ( 113.2 ) </Td> <Td> 42.4 ( 108.3 ) </Td> <Td> 41.0 ( 105.8 ) </Td> <Td> 35.0 ( 95 ) </Td> <Td> 52.1 ( 125.8 ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Average high \u00b0 C ( \u00b0 F ) </Th> <Td> 25.4 ( 77.7 ) </Td> <Td> 24.8 ( 76.6 ) </Td> <Td> 29.1 ( 84.4 ) </Td> <Td> 35.7 ( 96.3 ) </Td> <Td> 39.4 ( 102.9 ) </Td> <Td> 41.7 ( 107.1 ) </Td> <Td> 44.3 ( 111.7 ) </Td> <Td> 43.6 ( 110.5 ) </Td> <Td> 41.3 ( 106.3 ) </Td> <Td> 37.9 ( 100.2 ) </Td> <Td> 30.7 ( 87.3 ) </Td> <Td> 27.8 ( 82 ) </Td> <Td> 33.4 ( 92.1 ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Daily mean \u00b0 C ( \u00b0 F ) </Th> <Td> 21.1 ( 70 ) </Td> <Td> 20.6 ( 69.1 ) </Td> <Td> 24.8 ( 76.6 ) </Td> <Td> 30.1 ( 86.2 ) </Td> <Td> 33.4 ( 92.1 ) </Td> <Td> 35.8 ( 96.4 ) </Td> <Td> 38.7 ( 101.7 ) </Td> <Td> 38.5 ( 101.3 ) </Td> <Td> 35.2 ( 95.4 ) </Td> <Td> 32.6 ( 90.7 ) </Td> <Td> 25.4 ( 77.7 ) </Td> <Td> 23.4 ( 74.1 ) </Td> <Td> 29.97 ( 85.94 ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Average low \u00b0 C ( \u00b0 F ) </Th> <Td> 16.5 ( 61.7 ) </Td> <Td> 16.6 ( 61.9 ) </Td> <Td> 20.4 ( 68.7 ) </Td> <Td> 24.4 ( 75.9 ) </Td> <Td> 27.4 ( 81.3 ) </Td> <Td> 30.0 ( 86 ) </Td> <Td> 33.1 ( 91.6 ) </Td> <Td> 33.3 ( 91.9 ) </Td> <Td> 29.0 ( 84.2 ) </Td> <Td> 27.2 ( 81 ) </Td> <Td> 20.0 ( 68 ) </Td> <Td> 19.0 ( 66.2 ) </Td> <Td> 22.5 ( 72.5 ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Record low \u00b0 C ( \u00b0 F ) </Th> <Td> 6.1 ( 43 ) </Td> <Td> 6.9 ( 44.4 ) </Td> <Td> 9.0 ( 48.2 ) </Td> <Td> 13.4 ( 56.1 ) </Td> <Td> 15.1 ( 59.2 ) </Td> <Td> 18.2 ( 64.8 ) </Td> <Td> 20.4 ( 68.7 ) </Td> <Td> 23.1 ( 73.6 ) </Td> <Td> 16.5 ( 61.7 ) </Td> <Td> 15.0 ( 59 ) </Td> <Td> 11.8 ( 53.2 ) </Td> <Td> 8.2 ( 46.8 ) </Td> <Td> 6.1 ( 43 ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Average precipitation mm ( inches ) </Th> <Td> 18.8 ( 0.74 ) </Td> <Td> 25.0 ( 0.984 ) </Td> <Td> 22.1 ( 0.87 ) </Td> <Td> 7.2 ( 0.283 ) </Td> <Td> 0.4 ( 0.016 ) </Td> <Td> 0.0 ( 0 ) </Td> <Td> 0.0 ( 0 ) </Td> <Td> 0.0 ( 0 ) </Td> <Td> 0.0 ( 0 ) </Td> <Td> ( 0.043 ) </Td> <Td> 2.7 ( 0.106 ) </Td> <Td> 16.2 ( 0.638 ) </Td> <Td> 93.5 ( 3.68 ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Average precipitation days </Th> <Td> 2.0 </Td> <Td> 4.7 </Td> <Td> 4.0 </Td> <Td> 2.6 </Td> <Td> 0.3 </Td> <Td> 0.0 </Td> <Td> 0.0 </Td> <Td> 0.5 </Td> <Td> 0.1 </Td> <Td> 0.2 </Td> <Td> 1.3 </Td> <Td> 3.8 </Td> <Td> 19.5 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Average relative humidity ( % ) </Th> <Td> 65 </Td> <Td> 65 </Td> <Td> 63 </Td> <Td> 55 </Td> <Td> 53 </Td> <Td> 58 </Td> <Td> 56 </Td> <Td> 57 </Td> <Td> 60 </Td> <Td> 60 </Td> <Td> 61 </Td> <Td> 64 </Td> <Td> 59.8 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Mean monthly sunshine hours </Th> <Td> 254.2 </Td> <Td> 229.6 </Td> <Td> 254.2 </Td> <Td> 294.0 </Td> <Td> 344.1 </Td> <Td> 342.0 </Td> <Td> 322.4 </Td> <Td> 316.2 </Td> <Td> 309.0 </Td> <Td> 303.8 </Td> <Td> 285.0 </Td> <Td> 254.2 </Td> <Td> 3,508.7 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Percent possible sunshine </Th> <Td> 75 </Td> <Td> 75 </Td> <Td> 68 </Td> <Td> 75 </Td> <Td> 85 </Td> <Td> 81 </Td> <Td> 74 </Td> <Td> 78 </Td> <Td> 86 </Td> <Td> 82 </Td> <Td> 86 </Td> <Td> 75 </Td> <Td> 78.3 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan=\"14\"> Source #

The ruler , His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum , is also the Vice President and Prime Minister of the United Arab Emirates and member of the Supreme Council of the Union ( SCU ) . Dubai appoints 8 members in two - term periods to the Federal National Council ( FNC ) of the UAE , the supreme federal legislative body . </P> <P> The Dubai Municipality ( DM ) was established by the then - ruler of Dubai , Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum , in 1954 for purposes of city planning , citizen services and upkeep of local facilities . DM is chaired by Hamdan bin Rashid Al Maktoum , deputy ruler of Dubai , and comprises several departments such as the Roads Department , Planning and Survey Department , Environment and Public Health Department and Financial Affairs Department . In 2001 , Dubai Municipality embarked on an e-Government project with the intention of providing 40 of its city services through its web portal , ( dubai.ae ) . Thirteen such services were launched by October 2001 , while several other services were expected to be operational in the future . Dubai Municipality is also in charge of the city 's sanitation and sewage infrastructure . </P> <P> The UAE has a Minister of Happiness , appointed by Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum . The UAE has also appointed a Minister of Tolerance to promote tolerance as a fundamental value of the UAE , a country filled with a diverse range of faiths and ethnicities , and also a Minister for Youth Affairs . </P> <H3> Law enforcement ( edit ) </H3> <P> The Dubai Police Force , founded in 1956 in the locality of Naif , has law enforcement jurisdiction over the emirate . The force is under direct command of Mohammed bin Rashid al Maktoum . </P> Dubai Police operates a fleet of exotic cars . <P> Dubai and Ras al Khaimah are the only emirates that do not conform to the federal judicial system of the United Arab Emirates . The emirate 's judicial courts comprise the Court of First Instance , the Court of Appeal , and the Court of Cassation . The Court of First Instance consists of the Civil Court , which hears all civil claims ; the Criminal Court , which hears claims originating from police complaints ; and Sharia Court , which is responsible for matters between Muslims . Non-Muslims do not appear before the Sharia Court . The Court of Cassation is the supreme court of the emirate and hears disputes on matters of law only . </P> <H3> Sharia laws ( edit ) </H3> <P> Kissing in certain places is illegal and can result in deportation . Sometimes , certain narrow exemptions to Islamic law are made for adult non-Muslims . Adult non-Muslims are allowed to consume alcohol in licensed venues , typically within hotels , or at home with the possession of an alcohol license . Restaurants outside hotels in Dubai are typically not permitted to sell alcohol . Like other parts of the world , drinking and driving is illegal . </P> <H2> Human rights ( edit ) </H2> Main article : Human rights in Dubai <P> Human rights organisations have heavily criticised violations of human rights in Dubai . In a notorious case , a Norwegian businesswoman who claimed to have been raped was arrested and sentenced to sixteen months in prison for having extra-marital sex . </P> <P> Some of the 250,000 foreign labourers in the city have been alleged to live in conditions described by Human Rights Watch as `` less than humane '' . The mistreatment of foreign workers was a subject of the difficult - to - make documentary , Slaves in Dubai ( 2009 ) . The Dubai government has denied labour injustices and stated that the watchdog 's ( Human Rights Watch ) accusations were ' misguided ' . The filmmaker explained in interviews how it was necessary to go undercover to avoid discovery by the authorities , who impose high fines on reporters attempting to document human rights abuses , including the conditions of construction workers . Towards the end of March 2006 , the government had announced steps to allow construction unions . UAE labour minister Ali al - Kaabi said : `` Labourers will be allowed to form unions .

As of June 2017 , the population is 2,789,000 . The region covers 1,287.5 square kilometres ( 497.1 sq mi ) . The population density is 408.18 / km -- more than eight times that of the entire country . Dubai is the second most expensive city in the region and 20th most expensive city in the world . </P> <P> As of 2013 , only about 15 % of the population of the emirate was made up of UAE nationals , with the rest comprising expatriates , many of whom either have been in the country for generations or were born in the UAE . Approximately 85 % of the expatriate population ( and 71 % of the emirate 's total population ) was Asian , chiefly Indian ( 51 % ) and Pakistani ( 16 % ) ; other significant Asian groups include Bangladeshis ( 9 % ) and Filipinos ( 3 % ) . There is a sizable community of Somalis numbering around 30,000 , as well as other communities of various nationalities . A quarter of the population ( local and foreign ) reportedly traces their origins to Iran . In addition , 16 % of the population ( or 288,000 persons ) living in collective labour accommodation were not identified by ethnicity or nationality , but were thought to be primarily Asian . There are over 100,000 British expatriates in Dubai , by far the largest group of Western expatriates in the city . The median age in the emirate was about 27 years . In 2014 , there were estimated to be 15.54 births and 1.99 deaths per 1,000 people . There are other Arab nationals , including GCC nationals . </P> <P> Arabic is the national and official language of the United Arab Emirates . The Gulf dialect of Arabic is spoken natively by the Emirati people . English is used as a second language . Other major languages spoken in Dubai due to immigration are Malayalam , Hindi - Urdu ( or Hindustani ) , Gujarati , Persian , Sindhi , Tamil , Punjabi , Pashto , Bengali , Balochi , Tulu , Kannada , Sinhala , Marathi , Telugu , Tagalog and Chinese , in addition to many other languages . </P> <H3> Religion ( edit ) </H3> See also : Islam in the United Arab Emirates and Religion in the United Arab Emirates Jumeirah Mosque <P> Article 7 of the UAE 's Provisional Constitution declares Islam the official state religion of the UAE . The government subsidises almost 95 % of mosques and employs all Imams ; approximately 5 % of mosques are entirely private , and several large mosques have large private endowments . All mosques in Dubai are managed by the Islamic Affairs and Charitable Activities Department also known as `` Awqaf '' under the Government of Dubai and all Imams are appointed by the Government . Any person held preaching racism , religious hatred or promoting religious extremism is usually jailed and deported . </P> Minorities ( edit ) Evangelical church in Dubai <P> Dubai also has large Christian , Hindu , Sikh , Bah\u00e1'\u00ed , Buddhist and other religious communities residing in the city . </P> <P> Non-Muslim groups can own their own houses of worship , where they can practice their religion freely , by requesting a land grant and permission to build a compound . Groups that do not have their own buildings must use the facilities of other religious organisations or worship in private homes . Non-Muslim religious groups are permitted to advertise group functions openly and distribute various religious literature . However , outright proselytising is strictly prohibited under penalty of criminal prosecution , imprisonment and deportation for engaging in behaviour offensive to Islam . Catholics are served pastorally by the Apostolic Vicariate of Southern Arabia . British preacher Reverend Andrew Thompson claimed that the United Arab Emirates is one of the most tolerant places in the world towards Christians , and that it is easier to be a Christian in the UAE , than in the UK . </P> <H2> Economy ( edit ) </H2> Main article : Economy of Dubai Jebel Ali Port <P> One of the world 's fastest growing economies , Dubai 's gross domestic product is projected at US $107.1 billion , with a growth rate of 6.1 % in 2014 . Although a number of core elements of Dubai 's trading infrastructure were built on the back of the oil industry , revenues from oil and natural gas account for less than 5 % of the emirate 's revenues . It is estimated that Dubai produces 50,000 to 70,000 barrels ( 7,900 to 11,100 m ) of oil a day and substantial quantities of gas from offshore fields . The emirate 's share in the UAE 's total gas revenues is about 2 % . Dubai 's oil reserves have diminished significantly and are expected to be exhausted in 20 years . Real estate and construction ( 22.6 % ) , trade ( 16 % ) , entrep\u00f4t ( 15 % ) and financial services ( 11 % ) are the largest contributors to Dubai 's economy . </P> <P> Dubai 's non-oil foreign trade stood at $362 billion in 2014 . Of the overall trade volumes , imports had the biggest share with a value of $230 billion while exports and re-exports to the emirate stood at $31 billion and $101 billion respectively . </P> <P> By 2014 , China had emerged as Dubai 's largest international trading partner , with a total of $47.7 billion in trade flows , up 29 % from 2013 . India was second among Dubai 's key trading partners with a trade of $29.7 billion , followed by the United States at $22.62 billion . The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was Dubai 's fourth trading partner globally and first in the GCC and Arab world with a total trade value of $14.2 billion . Trade with Germany in 2014 totalled $12.3 , Switzerland and Japan both at $11.72 billion and UK trade totalled $10.9 billion . </P> Dubai Creek , which separates Deira from Bur Dubai , played a vital role in the economic development of the city <P> Historically , Dubai and its twin across Dubai Creek , Deira ( independent of Dubai City at that time ) , were important ports of call for Western manufacturers . Most of the new city 's banking and financial centres were headquartered in the port area . Dubai maintained its importance as a trade route through the 1970s and 1980s . Dubai has a free trade in gold and , until the 1990s , was the hub of a `` brisk smuggling trade '' of gold ingots to India , where gold import was restricted . Dubai 's Jebel Ali port , constructed in the 1970s , has the largest man - made harbour in the world and was ranked seventh globally for the volume of container traffic it supports . Dubai is also a hub for service industries such as information technology and finance , with industry - specific free zones throughout the city . Dubai Internet City , combined with Dubai Media City as part of TECOM ( Dubai Technology , Electronic Commerce and Media Free Zone Authority ) , is one such enclave , whose members include IT firms such as Hewlett Packard Enterprise , HP Inc. , Google , EMC Corporation , Oracle Corporation , Microsoft , Dell and IBM , and media organisations such as MBC , CNN , BBC , Reuters , Sky News and AP . </P> <P> The government 's decision to diversify from a trade - based , oil - reliant economy to one that is service - and tourism - oriented made property more valuable , resulting in the property appreciation from 2004 to 2006 . A longer - term assessment of Dubai 's property market , however , showed depreciation ; some properties lost as much as 64 % of their value from 2001 to November 2008 . The large - scale real estate development projects have led to the construction of some of the tallest skyscrapers and largest projects in the world such as the Emirates Towers , the Burj Khalifa , the Palm Islands and the most expensive hotel , the Burj Al Arab . Dubai 's property market experienced a major downturn in 2008 and 2009 as a result of the slowing economic climate . By early 2009 , the situation had worsened with the Great Recession taking a heavy toll on property values , construction and employment . This has had a major impact on property investors in the region , some of whom were unable to release funds from investments made in property developments . As of February 2009 , Dubai 's foreign debt was estimated at approximately $80 billion , although this is a tiny fraction of the sovereign debt worldwide . Dubai real estate and UAE property experts believe that by avoiding the mistakes of the past , Dubai 's realty market can achieve stability in the future . </P> Downtown Dubai <P> The Dubai Financial Market ( DFM ) was established in March 2000 as a secondary market for trading securities and bonds , both local and foreign . As of fourth quarter 2006 , its trading volume stood at about 400 billion shares , worth $95 billion in total . The DFM had a market capitalisation of about $87 billion . The other Dubai - based stock exchange is NASDAQ Dubai , which is the international stock exchange in the Middle East . It enables a range of companies , including UAE and regional small and medium - sized enterprises , to trade on an exchange with an international brand name , with access by both regional and international investors . </P> <P> DMCC ( Dubai Multi Commodities Centre ) was established in 2002 . It 's world 's fastest growing free zone and been nominated as `` Global Free Zone of the Year 2016 '' by The Financial Times fDi Magazine . </P> <P> Dubai is also known as the City of Gold , because a major part of the economy is based on gold trades , with Dubai 's total gold trading volumes in H1 2011 reaching 580 tonnes , with an average price of US $1,455 per troy ounce . </P> <P> A City Mayors survey ranked Dubai 44th among the world 's best financial cities in 2007 , while another report by City Mayors indicated that Dubai was the world 's 27th richest city in 2012 , in terms of purchasing power parity ( PPP ) . Dubai is also an international financial centre ( IFC ) and has been ranked 37th within the top 50 global financial cities as surveyed by the MasterCard Worldwide Centres of Commerce Index ( 2007 ) , and 1st within the Middle East . Since it opened in September 2004 , the Dubai IFC has attracted , as a regional hub , leading international firms and set - up the NASDAQ Dubai which lists equity , derivatives , structured products , Islamic bonds ( sukuk ) and other bonds . The Dubai IFC model is an independent risk - based regulator with a legislative system consistent with English common law . </P> <P> In 2012 , the Global City Competitiveness Index by the Economist Intelligence Unit ranked Dubai at No. 40 with a total score of 55.9 . According to its 2013 research report on the future competitiveness of cities , in 2025 , Dubai will have moved up to 23rd place overall in the Index . Indians , followed by Britons and Pakistanis are the top foreign investors in Dubai realty . </P> <P> Dubai has launched several major projects to support its economy and develop different sectors . These include Dubai Fashion 2020 , and Dubai Design District , expected to become a home to leading local and international designers . The AED 4 billion first phase of the project will be complete by January 2015 . </P> <H3> Tourism and retail ( edit ) </H3> See also : Tourism in Dubai , List of tourist attractions in Dubai , and List of shopping malls in Dubai Dubai Marina beach in the Jumeirah Beach Residence ( JBR ) View of Atlantis , The Palm luxury hotel <P> Tourism is an important part of the Dubai government 's strategy to maintain the flow of foreign cash into the emirate . Dubai 's lure for tourists is based mainly on shopping , but also on its possession of other ancient and modern attractions . As of 2013 , Dubai was the 7th most visited city of the world based on air traffic and the fastest growing , increasing by a 10.7 % rate . Dubai hosted 14.9 million overnight visitors in 2016 , and is expected to reach 20 million tourists by 2020 . </P> The Dubai Fountain in Burj Khalifa lake , Dubai Mall <P> Dubai has been called the `` shopping capital of the Middle East '' . Dubai alone has more than 70 shopping centres , including the world 's largest shopping centre , Dubai Mall . Dubai is also known for the traditional souk districts located on either side of its creek . Traditionally , dhows from East Asia , China , Sri Lanka , and India would discharge their cargo and the goods would be bargained over in the souks adjacent to the docks . Dubai Creek played a vital role in sustaining the life of the community in the city and was the resource which originally drove the economic boom in Dubai . As of September 2013 , Dubai creek has been proposed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site . Many boutiques and jewellery stores are also found in the city . Dubai is also referred to as `` the City of Gold '' as the Gold Souk in Deira houses nearly 250 gold retail shops . </P> <P> Dubai Creek Park in Dubai Creek also plays a vital role in Dubai tourism as it showcase some of the most famous tourist attractions in Dubai such as Dolphinarium , Cable Car , Camel Ride , Horse Carriage and Exotic Birds Shows . </P> <P> Dubai has a wide range of parks like Safa park , Mushrif park , Hamriya park etc . Each park is uniquely distinct from the other . Mushrif park showcases different houses around the world . A visitor can check out the architectural features of the outside as well as the inside of each house . </P> Ski Dubai ( edit ) Ski slope in Ski Dubai Main article : Ski Dubai <P> Ski Dubai is a large indoor skiing facility at Mall of the Emirates , offering snowboarding , ski lessons , a children 's play area and a caf\u00e9 .

Many modern interpretations of Islamic architecture can be found here , due to a boom in construction and architectural innovation in the Arab World in general , and in Dubai in particular , supported not only by top Arab or international architectural and engineering design firms such as Al Hashemi and Aedas , but also by top firms of New York and Chicago . The most recent addition to the magnificent skyline of Dubai is the 150 meter high Dubai Frame ( Arabic : \u0628\u0631\u0648\u0627\u0632 \u062f\u0628\u064a \u200e ) located in Zabeel Park , Dubai .

A culmination point was reached in 2010 with the completion of the Burj Khalifa ( Khalifa Tower ) , now by far the world 's tallest building at 829.8 m ( 2,722 ft ) . The Burj Khalifa 's design is derived from the patterning systems embodied in Islamic architecture , with the triple - lobed footprint of the building based on an abstracted version of the desert flower hymenocallis which is native to the Dubai region . The completion of the Khalifa Tower , following the construction boom that began in the 1980s , accelerated in the 1990s , and took on a rapid pace of construction unparalleled in modern human history during the decade of the 2000s , leaves Dubai with the world 's tallest skyline as of 4 January 2010 .
