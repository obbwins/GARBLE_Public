Since its move to the last hour of primetime , several new episodes have been delayed a week at the last minute due to games overrunning into the 8 : 00 pm timeslot to allow local newscasts to start as close to 11 : 00 pm ET / 10 : 00 pm CT as possible ; in this case , a repeat of the series airs in the Mountain Time Zone westward instead , with Canada 's Global following CBS 's scheduling in order to take advantage of simsub opportunities . </Li> </Ul> <H3> Critical reception ( edit ) </H3> <P> Madam Secretary has been met with generally positive reviews from TV critics . On Metacritic , the show has a score of 66 out of 100 , based on 31 critics , indicating `` generally favorable reviews '' . On Rotten Tomatoes , the show holds a rating of 66 % , based on 50 reviews , with an average rating of 6.9 / 10 . The site 's consensus reads , `` Bolstered by Tea Leoni 's strong central performance , Madam Secretary is a solid but unspectacular political drama . '' </P> <H3> Criticism ( edit ) </H3> <P> Three women have served as Secretary of State to date : Madeleine Albright from 1997 to 2001 under Bill Clinton , Condoleezza Rice from 2005 to 2009 under George W. Bush , and Hillary Clinton from 2009 to 2013 under Barack Obama . Shortly after the series ' debut , Fox News asked if the show therefore served as a campaign ad supporting Hillary Clinton , but quoted the Los Angeles Times saying the lead character was `` no Hillary knockoff '' and a New York publicist calling the casting of a woman `` simple business and smart on CBS ' behalf '' . Conservative activist organization Culture and Media Institute , however , said the connection was clear , citing the women 's blond hair and pantsuits . </P> <P> When the trailer of the fifteenth episode of Season 3 ( Break in Diplomacy ) was released showing McCord responding to unwanted sexual advances by fictional Philippine president Datu Andrada by punching Andrada in the face , it became controversial in the Philippines due to perceived parallels between Andrada and real - life President Rodrigo Duterte , who was known for making inappropriate and sexist remarks . The Philippine Embassy in Washington even published a statement protesting the negative depiction on its Facebook page . </P> <P> The first episode of the fourth season , News Cycle , led to a hard protest from East Timor 's Minister of State and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Jos\u00e9 Ramos - Horta . `` It 's a slander against a country that only shows ignorance and racism , '' he explained . The TV show used the border dispute between Australia and East Timor in the Timor Sea ( The dispute is transferred in the TV show to the South China Sea , although neither Australia nor East Timor is bordering to it ) as background story . East Timor is shown as a country controlled by a Mexican drug cartel and used for drug transfer .
