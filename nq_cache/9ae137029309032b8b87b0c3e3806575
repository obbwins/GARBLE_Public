{"document_text": "Train horn - wikipedia <H1> Train horn </H1> Jump to : navigation , search Train horns are made of multiple horn units called chimes which produce different notes ; sounded together they make a chord . The Nathan model M5 pictured is a 5 chime horn . <P> A train horn is a powerful air horn that serves as an audible warning device on electric and Diesel locomotives . The horn 's primary purpose is to alert persons and animals to an oncoming train , especially when approaching a grade crossing . The horn is also used for acknowledging signals given by railroad employees , such as during switching operations . </P> Leslie S3L locomotive horn , once the most common horn in use on North American railroads <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 History and background </Li> <Li> 2 Operation <Ul> <Li> 2.1 United States </Li> <Li> 2.2 Germany </Li> <Li> 2.3 France </Li> <Li> 2.4 India </Li> <Li> 2.5 United Kingdom </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Placement on locomotives </Li> <Li> 4 Audio samples </Li> <Li> 5 Manufacturers <Ul> <Li> 5.1 North America <Ul> <Li> 5.1. 1 AirChime , Ltd . </Li> <Li> 5.1. 2 Buell Air Horns </Li> <Li> 5.1. 3 Gustin Bacon Mfg.

This susceptibility is exacerbated by the enormous weight and inertia of a train , which make it difficult to quickly stop when encountering an obstacle . Also , trains generally do not stop at grade crossings ( level crossings ) , instead relying upon pedestrians and vehicles to clear the tracks when they pass . Therefore , from their beginnings locomotives have been equipped with loud horns or bells to warn vehicles or pedestrians that they are coming . Steam locomotives had steam whistles , operated from steam produced by their boilers . </P> <P> As Diesel locomotives began to replace steam on most railroads during the mid-20th century , it was realized that the new locomotives were unable to utilize the steam whistles then in use . Early internal combustion locomotives were initially fitted with small truck horns or exhaust - powered whistles , but these were found to be unsuitable and hence the air horn design was scaled up and modified for railroad use . Early train horns often were tonally similar to the air horns still heard on road - going trucks today . It was found that this caused some confusion among people who were accustomed to steam locomotives and the sound of their whistles ; when approaching a grade crossing , when some people heard an air horn they expected to see a truck , not a locomotive , and accidents happened . So , locomotive air horns were created that had a much higher , more musical note , tonally much more like a steam whistle . This is why most train horns have a unique sound , different from that of road going trucks , although many switch engines , which did n't see road service ( service on the main lines ) , retained the deeper truck - like horns . </P> <P> Strict regulations specific to each country specify how loud horns must be , and how far in advance of grade crossings and other locations locomotive engineers are required to sound their horns to give adequate time to clear the tracks . Standard signals consisting of different sequences of horn blasts must be given in different circumstances . </P> <P> Due to the encroachment of development , some suburban dwellers have opposed railroad use of the air horn as a trackside warning device . Residents in some communities have attempted to establish quiet zones , in which train crews are instructed not to sound their horns , except in case of emergency . </P> <P> Recent years have seen an increase of horn theft from railroad property . </P> <H2> Operation ( edit ) </H2> Diagram of a typical locomotive air horn power chamber , showing operation <P> Train horns are operated by compressed air , typically 125 - 140 psi ( 8.6 - 9.6 bar ) , and fed from a locomotive main air reservoir . When the engineer opens the horn valve , air flows through a supply line into the power chamber at the base of the horn ( diagram , right ) . It passes through a narrow opening between a nozzle and a circular diaphragm in the power chamber , then out through the flaring horn bell . The flow of air past the diaphragm causes it to vibrate or oscillate against the nozzle , producing sound . </P> <P> Keep in mind that when an Air horn is not operating and has no Fluid pressure flowing through it , the interior of the power chamber housing is completely air tight , as the Diaphragm disc creates a full air tight seal against the nozzle surface . Referring to the cut - away blueprint diagram of a conventional air horn power chamber on the right , when a constant stream of pressurised Fluid enters through the small inlet at the bottom , the pressure in the power chamber increases as it is air tight internally . The pressure continues rising in Chamber ' A ' until the air pressure overcomes the spring tension of the Diaphragm . Once this occurs , the Diaphragm is deflected back , and in such , is no longer sealed against the nozzle . From this , the interior of the power chamber is now no longer air tight , as the Diaphragm has deflected off the nozzle . As a result , the pressurised Fluid now escapes out of the horn bell . Because the pressurised Fluid exits through the horn bell at a much faster rate than the Fluid enters into the power chamber through the base air inlet , the air pressure in the power chamber drops rapidly . As such , the Diaphragm re-seats itself against the nozzle surface . This entire process is one cycle of the Diaphragm operating . In reality , this operation process occurs much faster in accordance to the Frequency produced by the horn . The constant back and forth Oscillation of the Diaphragm creates sound waves , which are then amplified by the large flared horn bell . The length , thickness and diameter of the horn bell contribute to the Frequency of the note produced by the horn . </P> <P> When vibrated by the diaphragm , the column of air in the bell oscillates with standing waves . The length of the bell determines the wavelength of the sound waves , and thus the fundamental frequency ( pitch ) of the note produced by the horn ( measured in hertz ) . The longer the horn bell , the lower the note . </P> <P> North American diesel locomotives manufactured prior to the 1990s utilized an air valve actuated by the engineer through the manipulation of a lever or pull cord . Use of this method made possible a practice known as `` feathering '' , meaning that modulation of the horn 's volume was possible through finer regulation of the air valve . </P> <P> Many locomotives manufactured during the 1990s made use of pushbutton controls . In addition , several North American locomotives incorporated a sequencer pedal built into the cab floor beneath the operators position ; that when depressed , sounded the grade crossing sequence . </P> <P> Locomotives of European origin have featured pushbutton control of air horns since the mid-1960s . </P> <P> Current production locomotives from GE Transportation Systems and Electro - Motive Diesel utilize a lever - actuated solenoid valve . </P> <H3> United States ( edit ) </H3> Leslie A200 - 156 , a single chime horn used on locomotives in the early days of dieselization <P> On April 27 , 2005 , the Federal Railroad Administration ( FRA ) , which enforces rail safety regulations , published the final rule on the use of locomotive horns at highway - rail grade crossings . Effective June 24 , 2005 , the rule requires that locomotive horns be sounded at all public grade crossings at least 15 seconds , but not more than 20 seconds before entering a crossing . This rule applies when the train speed is below 45 mph ( 70 km / h ) . At 45 mph or above , trains are still required to sound their horn at the designated location ( usually denoted with a whistle post ) . </P> <P> The pattern for blowing the horn remains two long , one short , and one long . This is to be repeated or prolonged as necessary until the lead locomotive fully occupies the crossing . Locomotive engineers retain the authority to vary this pattern as necessary for crossings in close proximity , and are allowed to sound the horn in emergency situations no matter where the location . </P> <P> A ban on sounding locomotive horns in Florida was ordered removed by the FRA after it was shown that the accident rate doubled during the ban . The new ruling preempts any state or local laws regarding the use of the train horn at public crossings . This also provides public authorities the option to maintain and / or establish quiet zones provided certain supplemental or alternative safety measures are in place , and the crossing accident rate meets government standards . </P> <P> The following are the required horn signals listed in the operating rules of most North American railroads , along with their meanings . Signals are illustrated by an `` o '' for short sounds , and `` -- '' for longer sounds . ( Note that these signals and their indications are updated to reflect modern practice . ) Those rules marked with an asterisk ( * ) must be sounded when and / or where applicable . Those signals without an asterisk convey information to employees ; they must be used when voice communication is not available . </P> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Rule </Th> <Th> </Th> <Th> Sequence </Th> <Th> Indication </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 14 ( a ) </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> o </Td> <Td> Applying air brakes while standing . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 14 ( b ) </Td> <Td> * </Td> <Td> -- -- </Td> <Td> Proceeding .

( edit ) <P> AirChime , Ltd. traces their beginnings through the work of Robert Swanson in 1949 . Prior to the early 1950s , locomotives were equipped with air horns that sounded a singular note . </P> <P> Swanson sought to develop an air horn which would mimic the sound of a classic steam whistle . Using ancient Chinese musical theory , Swanson produced the six - note model ' H6 ' . This was impractical for railroad use , due to its relatively large size . Railroad equipment operates over routes restricted by loading gauge , a difference of only a few inches may prohibit that equipment from operating on the line in question . </P> <P> Swanson would later refine his ' H6 ' into the model ' H5 ' . As the numeric designation indicates , the horn sounds a five - note chord . </P> <P> In 1950 , AirChime introduced the ' M ' series , a further improvement on the earlier horns through elimination of unnecessary moving parts . Among the earliest customers of the AirChime ' M ' was the Southern Railway , which sought replacement horns for their motive power . The company announced this program through the placement of a full - page advertisement in the May 25 , 1951 edition of the Washington Times - Herald . </P> Refurbished Nathan - AirChime model P5 <P> Under Swanson 's guidance , AirChime would focus on ease of mass production , low maintenance , and reliability in their air horn design , with the development of the ' P ' ( 1953 ) , and ' K ' ( 1954 ) series </P> AirChime model K3L , shown here in an Auburn University - inspired livery <P> AirChime has been sold to their American licensee , Nathan Manufacturing , Inc. , a division of Micro Precision Group , Inc , in Windham , Connecticut . </P> Buell air horns ( edit ) An air horn manufactured by the American Strombos Co. , used on early locomotives as well as trucks <P> Founded in 1912 as The American Strombos Co. of Philadelphia , PA , Buell sold modified marine horns for rail use . They were often installed on small locomotives , electric interurban equipment . and railcars ( for example the Doodlebugs ) . </P> <P> Buell has recently made available a line of air horns specific for railroad equipment . </P> Gustin Bacon Mfg. Co. ( edit ) <P> The Gustin Bacon Mfg. Co. of Kansas City , MO offered airhorns for use on railroad equipment prior to the Second World War . </P> Leslie Controls , Inc. ( edit ) Leslie Tyfon model A200 - 154 air horn , used on many first - generation diesel locomotives <P> Leslie Controls , Inc. ( originally the Leslie Company of Lyndhurst , New Jersey , later Parsippany , finally relocating to Tampa , Florida in 1985 ) began horn production by obtaining the rights to manufacture the Kockums Mekaniska Verkstad product line of `` Tyfon '' brand airhorns , marketing these for railroad use beginning in the 1930s . Their model A200 series would later grace the rooftops of countless locomotives , such as the legendary Pennsylvania Railroad GG1 , as well as thousands of EMD E and F - units . Leslie eventually introduced their own line of multi-note airhorns , known as the `` Chime - Tone '' series , in direct competition with AirChime . </P> <P> Poor sales of the Chime - Tones ( due to the horns requiring an ample volume of air ) led the Leslie Company to introduce a new line of air horns utilizing interchangeable components while using less air to produce greater sound volume than the earlier `` Tyfon '' series . Developed by Kockums , this horn utilized a back - pressure power chamber design in order to enhance diaphragm oscillation . Known as the `` SuperTyfon '' series , these horns would eventually supplant the `` Tyfon '' in railroad service . </P> Leslie SuperTyfon model S - 5T , regarded by many aficionados as the ' king of horns ' <P> `` SuperTyfon '' horns were offered in single , dual , triple , quad , and five note configurations . </P> <P> Leslie Controls continues to manufacture `` SuperTyfon '' air horns for the railroad industry . </P> Prime Manufacturing , Inc. ( edit ) Prime model PM - 990 locomotive air horn <P> Prime Manufacturing , Inc. had produced locomotive appliances for many years prior to their entry into the air horn market in 1972 . Their line of `` Pneumatic Horns '' was basically a derivative of the Leslie SuperTyfon design ( having taken advantage of a patent expiration at the time ) , though their horns employed heavier castings than equivalents from Leslie , and sounding a somewhat richer timbre as a result . </P> <P> Sales were brisk ( railroads such as Union Pacific and the Burlington Northern were notable customers ) but ultimately disappointing . Finding themselves increasingly unable to compete in a niche market dominated by Leslie Controls and AirChime , Prime ceased air horn production c. 1999 . </P> Westinghouse air Brake Co. ( edit ) Westinghouse model E2 - B1 locomotive air horn consisting of three ' singles ' bolted onto a common plate <P> Westinghouse Air Brake Company ( known throughout the 19th and 20th Century as WABCO ) was the first to offer air horns specifically for use with railroad equipment , as early as the 1910s . Their model E2 was recognized by many for the deep , commanding tone it produced . </P> <P> In response to the Leslie multi-note `` Chime - Tone '' series , Westinghouse offered a bracket to which three of their single - note `` honkers '' could be bolted onto , achieving the same result as what the Chime - Tones did for Leslie . </P> <P> Overshadowed later on by Leslie and AirChime , WABCO eventually ceased production of most horns for the North American market . </P> <P> At present , the company is known as Wabtec , Inc. , and continues to offer their line of ' Pneumatic horns ' for the export market . </P> <H3> Australia ( edit ) </H3> <P> Railways in Australia often utilize the same type of air horns as their North American counterparts . Examples from both the Leslie Co. and AirChime Ltd. can be found there . </P> <P> Notable horns used in Australian railways , sourced from the United States include the Leslie S5T , Leslie RS5T , Nathan Airchime P3 , Nathan Airchime P5 , and the unique Nathan Airchime K5UL - AU - LS . </P> <P> In the earlier years of dieselisation in Australia , during the 1950 's , the earliest diesel locomotives were fitted with two chime horns manufactured by the Westinghouse Air Brake Company in Australia . These two chime horns were the WABCO Pneuphonic AB , consisting of an ' A ' single chime , and a ' B ' single chime . When played together , the combination often sounded melodious due to the ' perfect 4th chord ' produced when blowing in unison . </P> <P> Throughout the early 1960 's , the Roy - Victor - Butler ( REMOVED_SECRET ) company of Spotswood , Victoria , manufactured and supplied the majority of horns fitted to the locomotives constructed from the late 1950 's , to the late 1960 's . </P> <P> The REMOVED_SECRET horns fitted to the majority of locomotives used in Victoria ( Australia ) during the late 1950 's to 1960 's , were the 3 chime models . They were not very effective and seldom operated as intended . Not to mention , they produced a very displeasing sound , eventually resulting in their nickname `` screaming cats '' . </P> <P> The company specialised in producing pneumatic tyre pressure gauge meters , tyre air pumps , valves , as well as small automotive klaxons . In fact , many vintage Holden and Ford vehicles may be found to have REMOVED_SECRET electric snail horns fitted to them . </P> <P> Three chime REMOVED_SECRET horns have also been fitted to the older Electric Multiple Units ( EMU 's ) operating in Victoria . The old Swing Door ( train ) and Tait ( train ) EMU 's of the 1920 's and 1930 's , were fitted with REMOVED_SECRET three chimes , while the Harris ( train ) ( 1950 's & 60 's ) , Hitachi ( train ) ( 1970 's ) , and Comeng ( train ) ( 1980 's ) were also fitted with REMOVED_SECRET three chime horns . </P> <P> From the mid 1960 's , the railroads in Australia commenced sourcing horns from the United States . These horns were manufactured by the two main companies : Nathan Manufacturing , and Leslie Controls . </P> <P> Many of the older Australian Commonwealth Railways GM class diesel locomotives were re-fitted with Leslie S5T 's , as did the Commonwealth Railways CL class , with their horns re-located behind the pilot after their rebuild and consequent re-classing to CLP , and CLF . </P> <P> A large order of Leslie S5T 's took place in 1976 - 1977 in preparation for the Clyde Engineering built ' C ' class diesel locomotives , which were constructed from 1977 - 1978 . All the C classes were fitted with round - back Leslie S5T 's as standard . </P> <P> Through to the early to mid 1980 's , with the Leslie company replacing their ' S ' line of horns with the more improved ' RS ' line of horns , the A class ( rebuilt from B classes in 1983 ) , N class , 1st & 2nd order G class and BL class diesel locomotives all received Leslie RS5T 's as standard horns . </P> <P> The RS5T 's are somewhat more reliable than the previous S5T horns , however the sound produced by the RS5T tends to be flatter sounding , and harsher compared to the deeper and throatier sound emitted by the earlier S5T 's . </P> <P> Most of the X class diesel locomotives received Nathan Airchime P5 horns in the mid 1980 's , to replace the wretched and unpopular fleet of REMOVED_SECRET 3 chime horns originally mounted on the X class . Originally , it was thought of to replace the REMOVED_SECRET 's on the X classes , with the Leslie RS5T , however , this was deemed inappropriate due to the large size of the Leslie 5 chime horns , which would consequently reduce visibility significantly . Another factor was the Leslie horns were much dearer in price than the Nathan P5 . And so the X classes received Nathan P5 's , one mounted on the nose and one on the roof . </P> <P> Third and fourth order G class diesel locomotives all received the identical Nathan P5 's which the X classes received during the mid 1980 's . This was to reduce costs , as the Leslie RS5T 's were much dearer , as stated earlier . </P> <P> The AN class diesel locomotive is thought to be the final class fitted with Leslie RS5T 's in the factory . </P> <P> The older S class diesel locomotives were fitted with REMOVED_SECRET 3 chime horns originally . Only a very small amount still retain these . Most have been replaced with Nathan P5 's . S307 and S317 were fitted with Leslie 5 chime horns . 307 was fitted with a Leslie RS5T , while 317 was fitted with a Leslie S5T . Both locomotives have air restricting components built in to the air feed to the horns , to reduce noise pollution . </P> <P> Locomotives built from the mid 2000 's to current , were fitted with Nathan Airchime K5UL - AU - LS five chime horns . The ' UL ' in K5UL , denotes an ' Ultra-Low ' manifold , which was fabricated in order for the horn to be as low as possible when mounted , in order to comply with the tight loading gauge in Australia . The AU , in K5UL - AU , denotes ' Australian market ' as these horns were designed by Nathan Airchime in the United States specially for use in Australia . The ' LS ' in K5UL - AU - LS , denotes ' Low - Sound ' as these horns have multiple air inlets on the manifold , enabling low sound output in populated areas , as well as regular loud operation for general use . </P> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Air horn </Li> <Li> Hancock air whistle </Li> <Li> Steam whistle </Li> <Li> Train whistle </Li> <Li> Whistle post </Li> </Ul> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ `` Noise Abatement Society '' .
