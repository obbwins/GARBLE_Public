The current situation is different only in that six Indiana counties have since been moved from the Central time zone to the Eastern time zone . <P> The history of standard time in the United States began November 18 , 1883 , when United States and Canadian railroads instituted standard time in time zones . Before then , time of day was a local matter , and most cities and towns used some form of local solar time , maintained by some well - known clock ( for example , on a church steeple or in a jeweler 's window ) . The new standard time system was not immediately embraced by all . </P> <P> Use of standard time gradually increased because of its obvious practical advantages for communication and travel . Standard time in time zones was not established in U.S. law until the Standard Time Act of 1918 of March 19 , 1918 , also known as the Calder Act ( 15 USC 260 ) . The act also established daylight saving time , itself a contentious idea . </P> <P> Daylight saving time was repealed in 1919 , but standard time in time zones remained in law , with the Interstate Commerce Commission ( ICC ) having the authority over time zone boundaries . Daylight time became a local matter . It was re-established nationally early in World War II , and was continuously observed until the end of the war . </P> <P> After the war its use varied among states and localities . The Uniform Time Act of 1966 provided standardization in the dates of beginning and end of daylight time in the U.S. but allowed for local exemptions from its observance . The act also continued the authority of the ICC over time zone boundaries . In subsequent years , the United States Congress transferred the authority over time zones to the U.S. Department of Transportation ( DOT ) , modified ( several times ) the beginning date of daylight time , and renamed the three westernmost time zones . </P> <P> Time zone boundaries have changed greatly since their original introduction and changes still occasionally occur . DOT issues press releases when these changes are made . Generally , time zone boundaries have tended to shift westward . Places on the eastern edge of a time zone can effectively move sunset an hour later ( by the clock ) by shifting to the time zone immediately to their east . </P> <P> If they do so , the boundary of that zone is locally shifted to the west ; the accumulation of such changes results in the long - term westward trend . The process is not inexorable , however , since the late sunrises experienced by such places during the winter may be regarded as too undesirable . Furthermore , under the law , the principal standard for deciding on a time zone change is the `` convenience of commerce '' . Proposed time zone changes have been both approved and rejected based on this criterion , although most such proposals have been accepted . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 War Time 1918 and 1942 </Li> <Li> 2 Daylight Saving Time 1945 to 1966 </Li> <Li> 3 DST 1966 </Li> <Li> 4 DST 2007 </Li> <Li> 5 Start and end dates of United States Daylight Saving Time </Li> <Li> 6 See also </Li> <Li> 7 Notes </Li> <Li> 8 References </Li> <Li> 9 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> War time 1918 and 1942 ( edit ) </H2> `` War Time '' redirects here . This usage refers to the changes of the US War Time Act , not a general period of war . <P> Daylight saving time was established by the Standard Time Act of 1918 . The Act was intended to save electricity for seven months of the year , during World War I. DST was repealed in 1919 over a Presidential veto , but standard time in time zones remained in law , with the Interstate Commerce Commission ( ICC ) having the authority over time zone boundaries . Daylight time became a local matter . </P> <P> During World War II , Congress enacted the War Time Act ( 56 Stat. 9 ) on January 20 , 1942 . Year - round DST was reinstated in the United States on February 9 , 1942 , again as a wartime measure to conserve energy resources . This remained in effect until after the end of the war . The Amendment to the War Time Act ( 59 Stat. 537 ) , enacted September 25 , 1945 , ended DST as of September 30 , 1945 . During this period , the official designation War Time was used for year - round DST . For example , Eastern War Time ( EWT ) would be the equivalent of Eastern Daylight Time during this period . </P> <H2> Daylight saving time 1945 to 1966 ( edit ) </H2> <P> From 1945 to 1966 U.S. federal law did not address DST . States and cities were free to observe DST or not , and most places that did observe DST did so from the last Sunday in April to the last Sunday in September . In the mid-1950s many areas in the northeastern United States began extending DST to the last Sunday in October . The lack of standardization led to a patchwork where some areas observed DST while adjacent areas did not , and it was not unheard of to have to reset a clock several times during a short trip ( e.g. , bus drivers operating on West Virginia Route 2 between Moundsville , West Virginia , and Steubenville , Ohio had to reset their watches seven times over 35 miles ) . </P> <P> In summer 1960 April -- October Daylight Time was nearly universal in Pennsylvania , Maryland , Delaware and states east and north of there . In Minnesota , Iowa , Missouri , Kentucky and Virginia and states north and east of there , some areas had it and some did not . Except for California and Nevada , which had April - Sept Daylight Time , 99 % of the rest of the country used Standard Time year - round . ( The Official Guide says `` State law prohibits the observance of `` Daylight Saving '' time in Kentucky but Anchorage , Louisville and Shelbyville will advance their clocks one hour from Central Standard time for the period April 24 to October 29 , inclusive. `` ) </P> <P> In the middle 1960s the airline and other transportation industries lobbied for uniformity of Daylight dates in the United States . </P> <H2> DST 1966 ( edit ) </H2> <P> The U.S. federal Uniform Time Act became law on April 13 , 1966 and it mandated that DST begin nationwide on the last Sunday in April and end on the last Sunday in October , effective in 1967 . The act explicitly preempted all previously enacted state laws related to the beginning and ending of DST . Any state that wanted to be exempt from DST could do so by passing a state law , provided that it exempted the entire state , and Alaska , Arizona , Hawaii , Indiana , and Michigan chose to do so . However , Alaska , Indiana , and Michigan subsequently chose to observe DST . The law was amended in 1972 to permit states that straddle a time zone boundary to exempt the entire area of the state lying in one time zone . Indiana chose to exempt the portion of the state lying in the Eastern Time Zone ; however , that exemption was eliminated in 2006 and the entire state of Indiana now observes DST , leaving Arizona ( with the exception of the Navajo Indian Reservation ) and Hawaii as the only two states not to observe DST . On July 8 , 1986 , President Ronald Reagan signed the Federal Fire Prevention and Control Act of 1986 into law that contained a daylight saving rider authored by Senator Slade Gorton ( R - WA ) . The starting date of DST was amended to the first Sunday in April effective in 1987 . DST continued to end on the last Sunday in October . While the states retain the capability to exempt themselves from DST , they are forbidden by the 1966 federal law ( 15 USC 260a ( b ) ) from increasing a state 's time spent on DST , unless the United States Congress does this for the entire nation . </P> <P> In response to the 1973 energy crisis , DST in the United States began earlier in both 1974 and 1975 , commencing on the first Sunday in January ( January 6 ) in the former year and the last Sunday in February ( February 23 ) in the latter . The extension of daylight saving time was not continued due to public opposition to late sunrise times during the winter months . In 1976 , the United States reverted to the schedule set in the Uniform Time Act . </P> <H2> DST 2007 ( edit ) </H2> <P> Starting March 11 , 2007 , DST was extended another four to five weeks , from the second Sunday of March to the first Sunday of November . The change was introduced by Representatives Fred Upton ( R - MI ) and Edward Markey ( D - MA ) and added to the Energy Policy Act of 2005 ; the House had originally approved a motion that would have extended DST even farther from the first Sunday in March to the last Sunday in November , but Senators Jeff Bingaman ( D - NM ) and Pete Domenici ( R - NM ) agreed to scale back the proposal in conference committee due to complaints from farmers and the airline industry . Proponents claimed that the extension would save `` the equivalent of '' 10,000 barrels ( 1,600 m ) of oil per day , but this figure was based on U.S. Department of Energy information from the 1970s , the accuracy and relevance of which the DoE no longer stands by . Later studies by the U.S. Department of Energy and the California Energy Commission have predicted much smaller energy benefits . There is very little recent research on what the actual positive effects , if any , might be . </P> <P> Since DST moves sunrise one hour later by the clock , late sunrise times become a problem when DST is observed either too far before the vernal equinox or too far after the autumnal equinox . Because of this , the extension was greeted with criticism by those concerned for the safety of children who would have been forced to travel to school before sunrise , especially in the month of March . In addition , the airline industry was especially concerned if DST were to be extended through to the last Sunday in November , as this is very often ( 6 out of every 7 years ) the Sunday after Thanksgiving . This is one of the busiest travel days at American airports , and could have resulted in much havoc among travelers who forgot that the clocks were changing that day . </P> <P> If the original proposal to extend DST through the last Sunday in November had been adopted , the entire United States , with the exception of the states that exempted themselves , would have experienced the latest sunrises of the year during the month of November , which would have approached the extremely late sunrise times when DST went into effect on January 6 , 1974 due to the 1973 energy crisis creeping after 9 am in places like New Salem , North Dakota at the northwestern edges of time zones . </P> <H2> Start and end dates of United States Daylight Saving Time ( edit ) </H2> <Table> Key to colors
