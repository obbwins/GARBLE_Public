{"document_text": "Lake Nyos disaster - wikipedia <H1> Lake Nyos disaster </H1> Jump to : navigation , search Lake Nyos as it appeared eight days after the eruption <P> On 21 August 1986 , a limnic eruption at Lake Nyos in northwestern Cameroon killed 1,746 people and 3,500 livestock . </P> <P> The eruption triggered the sudden release of about 100,000 -- 300,000 tons ( 1.6 m tons , according to some sources ) of carbon dioxide ( CO ) . The gas cloud initially rose at nearly 100 kilometres per hour ( 62 mph ) and then , being heavier than air , descended onto nearby villages , displacing all the air and suffocating people and livestock within 25 kilometres ( 16 mi ) of the lake . </P> <P> A degassing system has since been installed at the lake , with the aim of reducing the concentration of CO in deep waters and therefore the risk of further eruptions . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Eruption and gas cloud </Li> <Li> 2 Effects on survivors </Li> <Li> 3 Aftermath </Li> <Li> 4 In popular culture </Li> <Li> 5 References </Li> <Li> 6 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Eruption and gas cloud ( edit ) </H2> <P> It is not known what triggered the catastrophic outgassing . Most geologists suspect a landslide , but some believe that a small volcanic eruption may have occurred on the bed of the lake . A third possibility is that cool rainwater falling on one side of the lake triggered the overturn . Others still believe there was a small earthquake , but as witnesses did not report feeling any tremors on the morning of the disaster , this hypothesis is unlikely . Whatever the cause , the event resulted in the supersaturated deep water rapidly mixing with the upper layers of the lake , where the reduced pressure allowed the stored CO to effervesce out of solution . </P> <P> It is believed that about 1.2 cubic kilometres ( 0.29 cu mi ) of gas was released . The normally blue waters of the lake turned a deep red after the outgassing , due to iron - rich water from the deep rising to the surface and being oxidised by the air . The level of the lake dropped by about a meter and trees near the lake were knocked down . </P> <P> Scientists concluded from evidence that a 100 m ( 330 ft ) column of water and foam formed at the surface of the lake , spawning a wave of at least 25 metres ( 82 ft ) that swept the shore on one side . </P> <P> Carbon dioxide , being about 1.5 times as dense as air , caused the cloud to `` hug '' the ground and move down the valleys , where there were various villages . The mass was about 50 meters ( 160 ft ) thick , and travelled downward at 20 -- 50 kilometres per hour ( 12 -- 31 mph ) . For roughly 23 kilometres ( 14 mi ) , the gas cloud was concentrated enough to suffocate many people in their sleep in the villages of Nyos , Kam , Cha , and Subum . About 4,000 inhabitants fled the area , and many of these developed respiratory problems , lesions , and paralysis as a result of the gas cloud . </P> <H2> Effects on survivors ( edit ) </H2> Cattle suffocated by carbon dioxide from Lake Nyos <P> One survivor , Joseph Nkwain from Subum , described himself when he awoke after the gases had struck : </P> <P> `` I could not speak . I became unconscious . I could not open my mouth because then I smelled something terrible ... I heard my daughter snoring in a terrible way , very abnormal ... When crossing to my daughter 's bed ... I collapsed and fell . I was there till nine o'clock in the ( Friday ) morning ... until a friend of mine came and knocked at my door ... I was surprised to see that my trousers were red , had some stains like honey . I saw some ... starchy mess on my body . My arms had some wounds ... I did n't really know how I got these wounds ... I opened the door ... I wanted to speak , my breath would not come out ... My daughter was already dead ... I went into my daughter 's bed , thinking that she was still sleeping . I slept till it was 4 : 30 p.m. in the afternoon ... on Friday . ( Then ) I managed to go over to my neighbors ' houses . They were all dead ... I decided to leave ... ( because ) most of my family was in Wum ... I got my motorcycle ... A friend whose father had died left with me ( for ) Wum ... As I rode ... through Nyos I did n't see any sign of any living thing ... ( When I got to Wum ) , I was unable to walk , even to talk ... my body was completely weak . '' </P> <P> Following the eruption , many survivors were treated at the main hospital in Yaound\u00e9 , the country 's capital . It was believed that many of the victims had been poisoned by a mixture of gases that included hydrogen and sulfur . Poisoning by these gases would lead to burning pains in the eyes and nose , coughing and signs of asphyxiation similar to being strangled . </P> <H2> Aftermath ( edit ) </H2> <P> The scale of the disaster led to much study on how a recurrence could be prevented . Several researchers proposed the installation of degassing columns from rafts in the middle of the lake . The principle is to slowly vent the CO by lifting heavily saturated water from the bottom of the lake through a pipe , initially by using a pump , but only until the release of gas inside the pipe naturally lifts the column of effervescing water , making the process self - sustaining . </P> <P> Starting from 1995 , feasibility studies were successfully conducted , and the first permanent degassing tube was installed at Lake Nyos in 2001 . Two additional pipes were installed in 2011 </P> <P> Following the Lake Nyos disaster , scientists investigated other African lakes to see if a similar phenomenon could happen elsewhere . Lake Kivu in the Democratic Republic of Congo , 2,000 times larger than Lake Nyos , was also found to be supersaturated , and geologists found evidence that outgassing events around the lake happened about every thousand years . </P> <H2> In popular culture ( edit ) </H2> <P> A Greek novel by Basileios Drolias focusing on the lake Nyos disaster and the degassing of the lake was published in 2016 . </P> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ `` Can We Bury Global Warming ?
