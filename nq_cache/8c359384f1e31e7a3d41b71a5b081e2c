It has land borders with Lebanon to the north , Syria to the northeast , Jordan on the east , the Palestinian territories of the West Bank and Gaza Strip to the east and west , respectively , and Egypt to the southwest . The country contains geographically diverse features within its relatively small area . Israel 's economy and technology center is Tel Aviv , while its seat of government and proclaimed capital is Jerusalem , although the state 's sovereignty over East Jerusalem is not recognised internationally . </P> <P> The Kingdoms of Israel and Judah emerged during the Iron Age . The Neo-Assyrian Empire destroyed Israel around 720 BCE . The Jewish -- Babylonian war resulted in the Babylonian conquest of Judah in 586 BCE and the formation of the province of Yehud . During the Persian rule , the Jewish autonomous province , Yehud Medinata , had existed for two centuries until the conquest of Alexander the Great . The successful Maccabean Revolt against the Seleucid Empire led to an independent Jewish kingdom in 110 BCE , which came to an end in 63 BCE when Judea became a client state of the Roman Republic under the Herodian dynasty . Judea lasted as a Roman province until the subsequent failed Jewish revolts resulted in widespread destruction , the sack of Jerusalem , expulsion of Jewish population and the renaming of the region from Iudaea to Syria Palaestina . Jewish presence in the Land of Israel has persisted over the centuries . During the 19th century , national awakening among Jews led to the establishment of the Zionist movement followed by waves of immigration to Ottoman and later British Palestine . </P> <P> In 1947 , the United Nations adopted a Partition Plan for Palestine recommending the creation of independent Arab and Jewish states and an internationalized Jerusalem . The plan was accepted by the Jewish Agency for Palestine , and rejected by Arab leaders . Next year , the Jewish Agency declared `` the establishment of a Jewish state in Eretz Israel , to be known as the State of Israel . '' Israel has since fought several wars with neighboring Arab states , in the course of which it has occupied territories including the West Bank , Golan Heights and the Gaza Strip ( still considered occupied after 2005 disengagement ) . It extended its laws to the Golan Heights and East Jerusalem , but not the West Bank . Israel 's occupation of the Palestinian territories is the world 's longest military occupation in modern times . Efforts to resolve the Israeli -- Palestinian conflict have not resulted in peace . However , peace treaties between Israel and both Egypt and Jordan have successfully been implemented . </P> <P> The population of Israel , as defined by the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics , was estimated in 2017 to be 8,753,100 people . It is the world 's only Jewish - majority state , with 74.8 % being designated as Jewish . The country 's second largest population group are Arabs , at 20.8 % ( including most East Jerusalem Arabs ) . The great majority of Israeli Arabs are Sunni Muslims , including significant numbers of semi-settled Negev Bedouins ; the rest are Christians and Druze . Other minorities include Arameans , Armenians , Assyrians , Black Hebrew Israelites , Circassians , Maronites and Samaritans . Israel also hosts a significant population of non-citizen foreign workers and asylum seekers from Africa and Asia , including illegal migrants from Sudan , Eritrea and other Sub-Saharan Africans . </P> <P> In its Basic Laws , Israel defines itself as a Jewish and democratic state . Israel is a representative democracy with a parliamentary system , proportional representation and universal suffrage . The prime minister is head of government and the Knesset is the legislature . Israel is a developed country and an OECD member , with the 34th - largest economy in the world by nominal gross domestic product as of 2016 . The country benefits from a highly skilled workforce and is among the most educated countries in the world with one of the highest percentages of its citizens holding a tertiary education degree . Israel has the highest standard of living in the Middle East , and has one of the highest life expectancies in the world . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Etymology </Li> <Li> 2 History <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Prehistory </Li> <Li> 2.2 Antiquity </Li> <Li> 2.3 Classical period </Li> <Li> 2.4 Middle Ages and modern history </Li> <Li> 2.5 Zionism and British mandate </Li> <Li> 2.6 After World War II </Li> <Li> 2.7 Early years of the State of Israel </Li> <Li> 2.8 Further conflict and peace process </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Geography and environment <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Tectonics and seismicity </Li> <Li> 3.2 Climate </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Demographics <Ul> <Li> 4.1 Major urban areas </Li> <Li> 4.2 Language </Li> <Li> 4.3 Religion </Li> <Li> 4.4 Education </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 5 Government and politics <Ul> <Li> 5.1 Legal system </Li> <Li> 5.2 Administrative divisions </Li> <Li> 5.3 Israeli - occupied territories </Li> <Li> 5.4 Foreign relations </Li> <Li> 5.5 International humanitarian efforts </Li> <Li> 5.6 Military </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 6 Economy <Ul> <Li> 6.1 Science and technology </Li> <Li> 6.2 Transportation </Li> <Li> 6.3 Tourism </Li> <Li> 6.4 Energy </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 7 Culture <Ul> <Li> 7.1 Literature </Li> <Li> 7.2 Music and dance </Li> <Li> 7.3 Cinema and theatre </Li> <Li> 7.4 Media </Li> <Li> 7.5 Museums </Li> <Li> 7.6 Cuisine </Li> <Li> 7.7 Sports </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 8 See also </Li> <Li> 9 Notes </Li> <Li> 10 References </Li> <Li> 11 Bibliography </Li> <Li> 12 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Etymology </H2> The Merneptah Stele ( 13th century BCE ) . The majority of biblical archeologists translate a set of hieroglyphs as `` Israel , '' the first instance of the name in the record . <P> Upon independence in 1948 , the country formally adopted the name `` State of Israel '' ( Hebrew : \u05de\u05b0\u05d3\u05b4\u05d9\u05e0\u05b7\u05ea \u05d9\u05b4\u05e9\u05b0\u05c2\u05e8\u05b8\u05d0\u05b5\u05dc \u200e Med\u012bnat Yisr\u0101'el ( medi\u02c8nat jis\u0281a\u02c8\u0294el ) ; Arabic : \u062f\u064e\u0648\u0652\u0644\u064e\u0629 \u0625\u0650\u0633\u0652\u0631\u064e\u0627\u0626\u0650\u064a\u0644 \u200e \u200e Dawlat Isr\u0101\u02bc\u012bl ( dawlat \u0294isra\u02d0\u02c8\u0294i\u02d0l ) ) after other proposed historical and religious names including Eretz Israel ( `` the Land of Israel '' ) , Zion , and Judea , were considered but rejected . In the early weeks of independence , the government chose the term `` Israeli '' to denote a citizen of Israel , with the formal announcement made by Minister of Foreign Affairs Moshe Sharett . </P> <P> The names Land of Israel and Children of Israel have historically been used to refer to the biblical Kingdom of Israel and the entire Jewish people respectively . The name `` Israel '' ( Standard Yisra\u02beel , Isr\u0101\u02be\u012bl ; Septuagint Greek : \u1f38\u03c3\u03c1\u03b1\u03ae\u03bb Isra\u0113l ; ' El ( God ) persists / rules ' , though after Hosea 12 : 4 often interpreted as `` struggle with God '' ) in these phrases refers to the patriarch Jacob who , according to the Hebrew Bible , was given the name after he successfully wrestled with the angel of the Lord . Jacob 's twelve sons became the ancestors of the Israelites , also known as the Twelve Tribes of Israel or Children of Israel . Jacob and his sons had lived in Canaan but were forced by famine to go into Egypt for four generations , lasting 430 years , until Moses , a great - great grandson of Jacob , led the Israelites back into Canaan during the `` Exodus '' . The earliest known archaeological artifact to mention the word `` Israel '' as a collective is the Merneptah Stele of ancient Egypt ( dated to the late 13th century BCE ) . </P> <P> The area is also known as the Holy Land , being holy for all Abrahamic religions including Judaism , Christianity , Islam and the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith . From 1920 , the whole region was known as Palestine ( under British Mandate ) until the Israeli Declaration of Independence of 1948 . Through the centuries , the territory was known by a variety of other names , including Canaan , Djahy , Samaria , Judea , Yehud , Iudaea , Coele - Syria , Syria Palaestina and Southern Syria . </P> <H2> History </H2> Main article : History of Israel <H3> Prehistory </H3> Further information : Prehistory of the Levant <P> The oldest evidence of early humans in the territory of modern Israel , dating to 1.5 million years ago , was found in Ubeidiya near the Sea of Galilee . Other notable Paleolithic sites include caves Tabun , Qesem and Manot . The oldest fossils of anatomically modern humans found outside Africa are the Skhul and Qafzeh hominins , who lived in the area that is now northern Israel 120,000 years ago . Around 10th millennium BCE , the Natufian culture existed in the area . </P> <H3> Antiquity </H3> Main article : History of ancient Israel and Judah Further information : Israelites , Kingdom of Israel ( Samaria ) , and Kingdom of Judah The Large Stone Structure , archaeological site of ancient Jerusalem <P> The early history of the territory is unclear . Modern archaeology has largely discarded the historicity of the narrative in the Torah concerning the patriarchs , The Exodus , and the conquest described in the Book of Joshua , and instead views the narrative as constituting the Israelites ' inspiring national myth . Ancestors of the Israelites may have included ancient Semitic - speaking peoples native to Canaan . The Israelites and their culture , according to the modern archaeological account , did not overtake the region by force , but instead branched out of the Canaanite peoples and culture through the development of a distinct monolatristic -- and later monotheistic -- religion centered on Yahweh . The archaeological evidence indicates a society of village - like centres , but with more limited resources and a small population . Villages had populations of up to 300 or 400 , which lived by farming and herding , and were largely self - sufficient ; economic interchange was prevalent . Writing was known and available for recording , even in small sites . </P> Map of Israel and Judah in the 9th century BCE <P> While it is unclear if there was ever a United Monarchy , there is well accepted archeological evidence referring to `` Israel '' in the Merneptah Stele which dates to about 1200 BCE ; and the Canaanites are archeologically attested in the Middle Bronze Age . There is debate about the earliest existence of the Kingdoms of Israel and Judah and their extent and power , but historians agree that a Kingdom of Israel existed by ca . 900 BCE and that a Kingdom of Judah existed by ca . 700 BCE . The Kingdom of Israel was destroyed around 720 BCE , when it was conquered by the Neo-Assyrian Empire . </P> <P> In 586 BCE , King Nebuchadnezzar II of Babylon conquered Judah . According to the Hebrew Bible , he destroyed Solomon 's Temple and exiled the Jews to Babylon . The defeat was also recorded in the Babylonian Chronicles . The Babylonian exile ended around 538 BCE under the rule of the Persian Cyrus the Great after he captured Babylon . The Second Temple was constructed around 520 BCE . As part of the Persian Empire , the former Kingdom of Judah became the province of Judah ( Yehud Medinata ) with different borders , covering a smaller territory . The population of the province was greatly reduced from that of the kingdom , archaeological surveys showing a population of around 30,000 people in the 5th to 4th centuries BCE . </P> <H3> Classical period </H3> Main article : Second Temple period Further information : Hasmonean dynasty , Herodian dynasty , and Jewish -- Roman wars Portion of the Temple Scroll , one of the Dead Sea Scrolls written during the Second Temple period <P> With successive Persian rule , the autonomous province Yehud Medinata was gradually developing back into urban society , largely dominated by Judeans . The Greek conquests largely skipped the region without any resistance or interest . Incorporated into Ptolemaic and finally Seleucid empires , the southern Levant was heavily hellenized , building the tensions between Judeans and Greeks . The conflict erupted in 167 BCE with the Maccabean Revolt , which succeeded in establishing an independent Hasmonean Kingdom in Judah , which later expanded over much of modern Israel , as the Seleucids gradually lost control in the region . </P> Masada fortress , location of the final battle in the First Jewish -- Roman War <P> The Roman Empire invaded the region in 63 BCE , first taking control of Syria , and then intervening in the Hasmonean Civil War . The struggle between pro-Roman and pro-Parthian factions in Judea eventually led to the installation of Herod the Great and consolidation of the Herodian kingdom as a vassal Judean state of Rome . With the decline of the Herodian dynasty , Judea , transformed into a Roman province , became the site of a violent struggle of Jews against Greco - Romans , culminating in the Jewish -- Roman wars , ending in wide - scale destruction , expulsions , and genocide . Jewish presence in the region significantly dwindled after the failure of the Bar Kokhba revolt against the Roman Empire in 132 CE . </P> <P> Nevertheless , there was a continuous small Jewish presence and Galilee became its religious center . The Mishnah and part of the Talmud , central Jewish texts , were composed during the 2nd to 4th centuries CE in Tiberias and Jerusalem . The region came to be populated predominantly by Greco - Romans on the coast and Samaritans in the hill - country . Christianity was gradually evolving over Roman paganism , when the area stood under Byzantine rule . Through the 5th and 6th centuries , the dramatic events of the repeated Samaritan revolts reshaped the land , with massive destruction to Byzantine Christian and Samaritan societies and a resulting decrease of the population . After the Persian conquest and the installation of a short - lived Jewish Commonwealth in 614 CE , the Byzantine Empire reconquered the country in 628 . </P> <H3> Middle ages and modern History </H3> Further information : History of Jerusalem during the Middle Ages , Islamization of Palestine , and Old Yishuv Kfar Bar'am , an ancient Jewish village , abandoned some time between the 7th -- 13th centuries AD . <P> In 634 -- 641 CE , the region , including Jerusalem , was conquered by the Arabs who had just recently adopted Islam . Control of the region transferred between the Rashidun Caliphs , Umayyads , Abbasids , Fatimids , Seljuks , Crusaders , and Ayyubids throughout the next three centuries . </P> <P> During the siege of Jerusalem by the First Crusade in 1099 , the Jewish inhabitants of the city fought side by side with the Fatimid garrison and the Muslim population who tried in vain to defend the city against the Crusaders . When the city fell , about 60,000 people were massacred , including 6,000 Jews seeking refuge in a synagogue . At this time , a full thousand years after the fall of the Jewish state , there were Jewish communities all over the country . Fifty of them are known and include Jerusalem , Tiberias , Ramleh , Ashkelon , Caesarea , and Gaza . According to Albert of Aachen , the Jewish residents of Haifa were the main fighting force of the city , and `` mixed with Saracen ( Fatimid ) troops '' , they fought bravely for close to a month until forced into retreat by the Crusader fleet and land army . However , Joshua Prawer expressed doubt over the story , noting that Albert did not attend the Crusades and that such a prominent role for the Jews is not mentioned by any other source . </P> <P> In 1165 , Maimonides visited Jerusalem and prayed on the Temple Mount , in the `` great , holy house . '' In 1141 the Spanish - Jewish poet Yehuda Halevi issued a call for Jews to migrate to the Land of Israel , a journey he undertook himself . In 1187 Sultan Saladin , founder of the Ayyubid dynasty , defeated the Crusaders in the Battle of Hattin and subsequently captured Jerusalem and almost all of Palestine . In time , Saladin issued a proclamation inviting Jews to return and settle in Jerusalem , and according to Judah al - Harizi , they did : `` From the day the Arabs took Jerusalem , the Israelites inhabited it . '' Al - Harizi compared Saladin 's decree allowing Jews to re-establish themselves in Jerusalem to the one issued by the Persian king Cyrus the Great over 1,600 years earlier . </P> The 13th - century Ramban Synagogue in Jerusalem <P> In 1211 , the Jewish community in the country was strengthened by the arrival of a group headed by over 300 rabbis from France and England , among them Rabbi Samson ben Abraham of Sens. Nachmanides ( Ramban ) , the 13th - century Spanish rabbi and recognised leader of Jewry greatly praised the land of Israel and viewed its settlement as a positive commandment incumbent on all Jews . He wrote `` If the gentiles wish to make peace , we shall make peace and leave them on clear terms ; but as for the land , we shall not leave it in their hands , nor in the hands of any nation , not in any generation . '' </P> <P> In 1260 , control passed to the Mamluk sultans of Egypt . The country was located between the two centres of Mamluk power , Cairo and Damascus , and only saw some development along the postal road connecting the two cities . Jerusalem , although left without the protection of any city walls since 1219 , also saw a flurry of new construction projects centred around the Al - Aqsa Mosque compound on the Temple Mount . In 1266 the Mamluk Sultan Baybars converted the Cave of the Patriarchs in Hebron into an exclusive Islamic sanctuary and banned Christians and Jews from entering , which previously would be able to enter it for a fee . The ban remained in place until Israel took control of the building in 1967 . </P> Jews at the Western Wall , 1870s <P> In 1470 , Isaac b . Meir Latif arrived from Italy and counted 150 Jewish families in Jerusalem . Thanks to Joseph Saragossi who had arrived in the closing years of the 15th century , Safed and its environs had developed into the largest concentration of Jews in Palestine . With the help of the Sephardic immigration from Spain , the Jewish population had increased to 10,000 by the early 16th century . </P> <P> In 1516 , the region was conquered by the Ottoman Empire ; it remained under Turkish rule until the end of the First World War , when Britain defeated the Ottoman forces and set up a military administration across the former Ottoman Syria . In 1920 the territory was divided between Britain and France under the mandate system , and the British - administered area which included modern day Israel was named Mandatory Palestine . </P> <H3> Zionism and British Mandate </H3> Further information : Zionism , Yishuv , Mandatory Palestine , and Balfour Declaration Theodor Herzl , visionary of the Jewish state <P> Since the existence of the earliest Jewish diaspora , many Jews have aspired to return to `` Zion '' and the `` Land of Israel '' , though the amount of effort that should be spent towards such an aim was a matter of dispute . The hopes and yearnings of Jews living in exile are an important theme of the Jewish belief system . After the Jews were expelled from Spain in 1492 , some communities settled in Palestine . During the 16th century , Jewish communities struck roots in the Four Holy Cities -- Jerusalem , Tiberias , Hebron , and Safed -- and in 1697 , Rabbi Yehuda Hachasid led a group of 1,500 Jews to Jerusalem . In the second half of the 18th century , Eastern European opponents of Hasidism , known as the Perushim , settled in Palestine . </P> `` Therefore I believe that a wonderous generation of Jews will spring into existence . The Maccabaeans will rise again . Let me repeat once more my opening words : The Jews wish to have a State , and they shall have one . We shall live at last as free men on our own soil , and die peacefully in our own home . The world will be freed by our liberty , enriched by our wealth , magnified by our greatness . And whatever we attempt there to accomplish for our own welfare will react with beneficent force for the good of humanity . '' Theodor Herzl ( 1896 ) . A Jewish State . Wikisource . ( scan ) <P> The first wave of modern Jewish migration to Ottoman - ruled Palestine , known as the First Aliyah , began in 1881 , as Jews fled pogroms in Eastern Europe . Although the Zionist movement already existed in practice , Austro - Hungarian journalist Theodor Herzl is credited with founding political Zionism , a movement which sought to establish a Jewish state in the Land of Israel , thus offering a solution to the so - called Jewish question of the European states , in conformity with the goals and achievements of other national projects of the time . In 1896 , Herzl published Der Judenstaat ( The Jewish State ) , offering his vision of a future Jewish state ; the following year he presided over the First Zionist Congress . </P> <P> The Second Aliyah ( 1904 -- 14 ) , began after the Kishinev pogrom ; some 40,000 Jews settled in Palestine , although nearly half of them left eventually . Both the first and second waves of migrants were mainly Orthodox Jews , although the Second Aliyah included socialist groups who established the kibbutz movement . During World War I , British Foreign Secretary Arthur Balfour sent the Balfour Declaration of 1917 to Baron Rothschild ( Walter Rothschild , 2nd Baron Rothschild ) , a leader of the British Jewish community , that stated that Britain intended for the creation of a Jewish `` national home '' within the Palestinian Mandate . </P> <P> In 1918 , the Jewish Legion , a group primarily of Zionist volunteers , assisted in the British conquest of Palestine . Arab opposition to British rule and Jewish immigration led to the 1920 Palestine riots and the formation of a Jewish militia known as the Haganah ( meaning `` The Defense '' in Hebrew ) , from which the Irgun and Lehi , or the Stern Gang , paramilitary groups later split off . In 1922 , the League of Nations granted Britain a mandate over Palestine under terms which included the Balfour Declaration with its promise to the Jews , and with similar provisions regarding the Arab Palestinians . The population of the area at this time was predominantly Arab and Muslim , with Jews accounting for about 11 % , and Arab Christians at about 9.5 % of the population . </P> <P> The Third ( 1919 -- 23 ) and Fourth Aliyahs ( 1924 -- 29 ) brought an additional 100,000 Jews to Palestine . The rise of Nazism and the increasing persecution of Jews in 1930s Europe led to the Fifth Aliyah , with an influx of a quarter of a million Jews . This was a major cause of the Arab revolt of 1936 -- 39 during which the British Mandate authorities alongside the Zionist militias of Haganah and Irgun killed 5,032 Arabs and wounded 14,760 , resulting in over ten percent of the adult male Palestinian Arab population killed , wounded , imprisoned or exiled . The British introduced restrictions on Jewish immigration to Palestine with the White Paper of 1939 . With countries around the world turning away Jewish refugees fleeing the Holocaust , a clandestine movement known as Aliyah Bet was organized to bring Jews to Palestine . By the end of World War II , the Jewish population of Palestine had increased to 33 % of the total population . </P> <H3> After world War II </H3> Further information : Intercommunal conflict in Mandatory Palestine , United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine , and Israeli Declaration of Independence <P> After World War II , Britain found itself in intense conflict with the Jewish community over Jewish immigration limits , as well as continued conflict with the Arab community over limit levels . The Haganah joined Irgun and Lehi in an armed struggle against British rule . At the same time , hundreds of thousands of Jewish Holocaust survivors and refugees sought a new life far from their destroyed communities in Europe . The Yishuv attempted to bring these refugees to Palestine but many were turned away or rounded up and placed in detention camps in Atlit and Cyprus by the British . </P> UN Map , `` Palestine plan of partition with economic union '' <P> On 22 July 1946 , Irgun attacked the British administrative headquarters for Palestine , which was housed in the southern wing of the King David Hotel in Jerusalem . A total of 91 people of various nationalities were killed and 46 were injured . The hotel was the site of the Secretariat of the Government of Palestine and the Headquarters of the British Armed Forces in Palestine and Transjordan . The attack initially had the approval of the Haganah . It was conceived as a response to Operation Agatha ( a series of widespread raids , including one on the Jewish Agency , conducted by the British authorities ) and was the deadliest directed at the British during the Mandate era . It was characterized as one of the `` most lethal terrorist incidents of the twentieth century . '' In 1947 , the British government announced it would withdraw from Palestine , stating it was unable to arrive at a solution acceptable to both Arabs and Jews . </P> <P> On 15 May 1947 , the General Assembly of the newly formed United Nations resolved that the United Nations Special Committee on Palestine be created `` to prepare for consideration at the next regular session of the Assembly a report on the question of Palestine . '' In the Report of the Committee dated 3 September 1947 to the General Assembly , the majority of the Committee in Chapter VI proposed a plan to replace the British Mandate with `` an independent Arab State , an independent Jewish State , and the City of Jerusalem ... the last to be under an International Trusteeship System . '' On 29 November 1947 , the General Assembly adopted Resolution 181 ( II ) recommending the adoption and implementation of the Plan of Partition with Economic Union . The plan attached to the resolution was essentially that proposed by the majority of the Committee in the report of 3 September . The Jewish Agency , which was the recognized representative of the Jewish community , accepted the plan . The Arab League and Arab Higher Committee of Palestine rejected it , and indicated that they would reject any other plan of partition . On the following day , 1 December 1947 , the Arab Higher Committee proclaimed a three - day strike , and Arab gangs began attacking Jewish targets . The Jews were initially on the defensive as civil war broke out , but in early April 1948 moved onto the offensive . The Arab Palestinian economy collapsed and 250,000 Palestinian Arabs fled or were expelled . </P> David Ben - Gurion proclaiming the Israeli Declaration of Independence on 14 May 1948 <P> On 14 May 1948 , the day before the expiration of the British Mandate , David Ben - Gurion , the head of the Jewish Agency , declared `` the establishment of a Jewish state in Eretz - Israel , to be known as the State of Israel . '' The only reference in the text of the Declaration to the borders of the new state is the use of the term Eretz - Israel ( `` Land of Israel '' ) . The following day , the armies of four Arab countries -- Egypt , Syria , Transjordan and Iraq -- entered what had been British Mandatory Palestine , launching the 1948 Arab -- Israeli War ; contingents from Yemen , Morocco , Saudi Arabia and Sudan joined the war . The apparent purpose of the invasion was to prevent the establishment of the Jewish state at inception , and some Arab leaders talked about driving the Jews into the sea . According to Benny Morris , Jews felt that the invading Arab armies aimed to slaughter the Jews . The Arab league stated that the invasion was to restore law and order and to prevent further bloodshed . </P> Raising of the Ink Flag , marking the end of the 1948 Arab -- Israeli War <P> After a year of fighting , a ceasefire was declared and temporary borders , known as the Green Line , were established . Jordan annexed what became known as the West Bank , including East Jerusalem , and Egypt took control of the Gaza Strip . The United Nations estimated that more than 700,000 Palestinians were expelled by or fled from advancing Israeli forces during the conflict -- what would become known in Arabic as the Nakba ( `` catastrophe '' ) . </P> <H3> Early years of the state of Israel </H3> Further information : Arab -- Israeli conflict <P> Israel was admitted as a member of the United Nations by majority vote on 11 May 1949 . Both Israel and Jordan were genuinely interested in a peace agreement but the British acted as a brake on the Jordanian effort in order to avoid damaging British interests in Egypt . In the early years of the state , the Labor Zionist movement led by Prime Minister David Ben - Gurion dominated Israeli politics . The Kibbutzim , or collective farming communities , played a pivotal role in establishing the new state . </P> <P> Immigration to Israel during the late 1940s and early 1950s was aided by the Israeli Immigration Department and the non-government sponsored Mossad LeAliyah Bet ( `` Institution for Illegal Immigration '' ) . Both groups facilitated regular immigration logistics like arranging transportation , but the latter also engaged in clandestine operations in countries , particularly in the Middle East and Eastern Europe , where the lives of Jews were believed to be in danger and exit from those places was difficult . Mossad LeAliyah Bet was disbanded in 1953 . The immigration was in accordance with the One Million Plan . The immigrants came for differing reasons . Some believed in a Zionist ideology or did it for the promise of a better life in Israel , while others moved to escape persecution or were expelled . </P> <P> An influx of Holocaust survivors and Jews from Arab and Muslim countries to Israel during the first three years increased the number of Jews from 700,000 to 1,400,000 . By 1958 , the population of Israel rose to two million . Between 1948 and 1970 , approximately 1,150,000 Jewish refugees relocated to Israel . Some new immigrants arrived as refugees with no possessions and were housed in temporary camps known as ma'abarot ; by 1952 , over 200,000 people were living in these tent cities . Jews of European background were often treated more favorably than Jews from Middle Eastern and North African countries -- housing units reserved for the latter were often re-designated for the former , with the result that Jews newly arrived from Arab lands generally ended up staying in transit camps for longer . Tensions that developed between the two groups over such discrimination persist to the present day . During this period , food , clothes and furniture had to be rationed in what became known as the austerity period . The need to solve the crisis led Ben - Gurion to sign a reparations agreement with West Germany that triggered mass protests by Jews angered at the idea that Israel could accept monetary compensation for the Holocaust . </P> Play media U.S. newsreel on the trial of Adolf Eichmann <P> During the 1950s , Israel was frequently attacked by Palestinian fedayeen , nearly always against civilians , mainly from the Egyptian - occupied Gaza Strip , leading to several Israeli counter-raids . In 1956 , Great Britain and France aimed at regaining control of the Suez Canal , which the Egyptians had nationalized . The continued blockade of the Suez Canal and Straits of Tiran to Israeli shipping , together with the growing amount of Fedayeen attacks against Israel 's southern population , and recent Arab grave and threatening statements , prompted Israel to attack Egypt . Israel joined a secret alliance with Great Britain and France and overran the Sinai Peninsula but was pressured to withdraw by the United Nations in return for guarantees of Israeli shipping rights in the Red Sea via the Straits of Tiran and the Canal . The war , known as the Suez Crisis , resulted in significant reduction of Israeli border infiltration . In the early 1960s , Israel captured Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann in Argentina and brought him to Israel for trial . The trial had a major impact on public awareness of the Holocaust . Eichmann remains the only person executed in Israel by conviction in an Israeli civilian court . </P> Territory held by Israel : before the Six - Day War after the war The Sinai Peninsula was returned to Egypt in 1982 . <P> Since 1964 , Arab countries , concerned over Israeli plans to divert waters of the Jordan River into the coastal plain , had been trying to divert the headwaters to deprive Israel of water resources , provoking tensions between Israel on the one hand , and Syria and Lebanon on the other . Arab nationalists led by Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser refused to recognize Israel , and called for its destruction . By 1966 , Israeli - Arab relations had deteriorated to the point of actual battles taking place between Israeli and Arab forces . In May 1967 , Egypt massed its army near the border with Israel , expelled UN peacekeepers , stationed in the Sinai Peninsula since 1957 , and blocked Israel 's access to the Red Sea . Other Arab states mobilized their forces . Israel reiterated that these actions were a casus belli and , on 5 June , launched a pre-emptive strike against Egypt . Jordan , Syria and Iraq responded and attacked Israel . In a Six - Day War , Israel defeated Jordan and captured the West Bank , defeated Egypt and captured the Gaza Strip and Sinai Peninsula , and defeated Syria and captured the Golan Heights . Jerusalem 's boundaries were enlarged , incorporating East Jerusalem , and the 1949 Green Line became the administrative boundary between Israel and the occupied territories . </P> <P> Following the 1967 war and the `` three nos '' resolution of the Arab League , during the 1967 -- 1970 War of Attrition Israel faced attacks from the Egyptians in the Sinai , and from Palestinian groups targeting Israelis in the occupied territories , in Israel proper , and around the world . Most important among the various Palestinian and Arab groups was the Palestinian Liberation Organization ( PLO ) , established in 1964 , which initially committed itself to `` armed struggle as the only way to liberate the homeland '' . In the late 1960s and early 1970s , Palestinian groups launched a wave of attacks against Israeli and Jewish targets around the world , including a massacre of Israeli athletes at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich . The Israeli government responded with an assassination campaign against the organizers of the massacre , a bombing and a raid on the PLO headquarters in Lebanon . </P> <P> On 6 October 1973 , as Jews were observing Yom Kippur , the Egyptian and Syrian armies launched a surprise attack against Israeli forces in the Sinai Peninsula and Golan Heights , that opened the Yom Kippur War . The war ended on 25 October with Israel successfully repelling Egyptian and Syrian forces but having suffered over 2,500 soldiers killed in a war which collectively took 10 -- 35,000 lives in about 20 days . An internal inquiry exonerated the government of responsibility for failures before and during the war , but public anger forced Prime Minister Golda Meir to resign . In July 1976 an airliner was hijacked during its flight from Israel to France by Palestinian guerrillas and landed at Entebbe , Uganda . Israeli commandos carried out an operation in which 102 out of 106 Israeli hostages were successfully rescued . </P> <H3> Further conflict and peace process </H3> Further information : Israeli -- Palestinian peace process See also : One - state solution , Two - state solution , Three - state solution , and Lieberman Plan <P> The 1977 Knesset elections marked a major turning point in Israeli political history as Menachem Begin 's Likud party took control from the Labor Party . Later that year , Egyptian President Anwar El Sadat made a trip to Israel and spoke before the Knesset in what was the first recognition of Israel by an Arab head of state . In the two years that followed , Sadat and Begin signed the Camp David Accords ( 1978 ) and the Israel -- Egypt Peace Treaty ( 1979 ) . In return , Israel withdrew from the Sinai Peninsula and agreed to enter negotiations over an autonomy for Palestinians in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip . </P> <P> On 11 March 1978 , a PLO guerilla raid from Lebanon led to the Coastal Road massacre . Israel responded by launching an invasion of southern Lebanon to destroy the PLO bases south of the Litani River . Most PLO fighters withdrew , but Israel was able to secure southern Lebanon until a UN force and the Lebanese army could take over . The PLO soon resumed its policy of attacks against Israel . In the next few years , the PLO infiltrated the south and kept up a sporadic shelling across the border . Israel carried out numerous retaliatory attacks by air and on the ground . </P> Israel 's 1980 law declared that `` Jerusalem , complete and united , is the capital of Israel . '' <P> Meanwhile , Begin 's government provided incentives for Israelis to settle in the occupied West Bank , increasing friction with the Palestinians in that area . The Basic Law : Jerusalem , Capital of Israel , passed in 1980 , was believed by some to reaffirm Israel 's 1967 annexation of Jerusalem by government decree , and reignited international controversy over the status of the city . No Israeli legislation has defined the territory of Israel and no act specifically included East Jerusalem therein . The position of the majority of UN member states is reflected in numerous resolutions declaring that actions taken by Israel to settle its citizens in the West Bank , and impose its laws and administration on East Jerusalem , are illegal and have no validity . In 1981 Israel annexed the Golan Heights , although annexation was not recognized internationally . Israel 's population diversity expanded in the 1980s and 1990s . Several waves of Ethiopian Jews immigrated to Israel since the 1980s , while between 1990 and 1994 , immigration from the post-Soviet states increased Israel 's population by twelve percent . </P> <P> On 7 June 1981 , the Israeli air force destroyed Iraq 's sole nuclear reactor under construction just outside Baghdad , in order to impede Iraq 's nuclear weapons program . Following a series of PLO attacks in 1982 , Israel invaded Lebanon that year to destroy the bases from which the PLO launched attacks and missiles into northern Israel . In the first six days of fighting , the Israelis destroyed the military forces of the PLO in Lebanon and decisively defeated the Syrians . An Israeli government inquiry -- the Kahan Commission -- would later hold Begin , Sharon and several Israeli generals as indirectly responsible for the Sabra and Shatila massacre . In 1985 , Israel responded to a Palestinian terrorist attack in Cyprus by bombing the PLO headquarters in Tunisia . Israel withdrew from most of Lebanon in 1986 , but maintained a borderland buffer zone in southern Lebanon until 2000 , from where Israeli forces engaged in conflict with Hezbollah . The First Intifada , a Palestinian uprising against Israeli rule , broke out in 1987 , with waves of uncoordinated demonstrations and violence occurring in the occupied West Bank and Gaza . Over the following six years , the Intifada became more organised and included economic and cultural measures aimed at disrupting the Israeli occupation . More than a thousand people were killed in the violence . During the 1991 Gulf War , the PLO supported Saddam Hussein and Iraqi Scud missile attacks against Israel . Despite public outrage , Israel heeded American calls to refrain from hitting back and did not participate in that war . </P> Shimon Peres ( left ) with Yitzhak Rabin ( center ) and King Hussein of Jordan ( right ) , prior to signing the Israel -- Jordan peace treaty in 1994 . <P> In 1992 , Yitzhak Rabin became Prime Minister following an election in which his party called for compromise with Israel 's neighbors . The following year , Shimon Peres on behalf of Israel , and Mahmoud Abbas for the PLO , signed the Oslo Accords , which gave the Palestinian National Authority the right to govern parts of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip . The PLO also recognized Israel 's right to exist and pledged an end to terrorism . In 1994 , the Israel -- Jordan peace treaty was signed , making Jordan the second Arab country to normalize relations with Israel . Arab public support for the Accords was damaged by the continuation of Israeli settlements and checkpoints , and the deterioration of economic conditions . Israeli public support for the Accords waned as Israel was struck by Palestinian suicide attacks . In November 1995 , while leaving a peace rally , Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated by Yigal Amir , a far - right - wing Jew who opposed the Accords . </P> The site of the 2001 Tel Aviv Dolphinarium discotheque massacre , in which 21 Israelis were killed . <P> Under the leadership of Benjamin Netanyahu at the end of the 1990s , Israel withdrew from Hebron , and signed the Wye River Memorandum , giving greater control to the Palestinian National Authority . Ehud Barak , elected Prime Minister in 1999 , began the new millennium by withdrawing forces from Southern Lebanon and conducting negotiations with Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat and U.S. President Bill Clinton at the 2000 Camp David Summit . During the summit , Barak offered a plan for the establishment of a Palestinian state . The proposed state included the entirety of the Gaza Strip and over 90 % of the West Bank with Jerusalem as a shared capital . Each side blamed the other for the failure of the talks . After a controversial visit by Likud leader Ariel Sharon to the Temple Mount , the Second Intifada began . Some commentators contend that the uprising was pre-planned by Arafat due to the collapse of peace talks . Sharon became prime minister in a 2001 special election . During his tenure , Sharon carried out his plan to unilaterally withdraw from the Gaza Strip and also spearheaded the construction of the Israeli West Bank barrier , ending the Intifada . By this time 1,100 Israelis had been killed , mostly in suicide bombings . The Palestinian fatalities , from 2000 to 2008 , reached 4,791 killed by Israeli security forces , 44 killed by Israeli civilians , and 609 killed by Palestinians . </P> <P> In July 2006 , a Hezbollah artillery assault on Israel 's northern border communities and a cross-border abduction of two Israeli soldiers precipitated the month - long Second Lebanon War . On 6 September 2007 , the Israeli Air Force destroyed a nuclear reactor in Syria . At the end of 2008 , Israel entered another conflict as a ceasefire between Hamas and Israel collapsed . The 2008 -- 09 Gaza War lasted three weeks and ended after Israel announced a unilateral ceasefire . Hamas announced its own ceasefire , with its own conditions of complete withdrawal and opening of border crossings . Despite neither the rocket launchings nor Israeli retaliatory strikes having completely stopped , the fragile ceasefire remained in order . In what Israel described as a response to more than a hundred Palestinian rocket attacks on southern Israeli cities , Israel began an operation in Gaza on 14 November 2012 , lasting eight days . Israel started another operation in Gaza following an escalation of rocket attacks by Hamas in July 2014 . </P> <H2> Geography and environment </H2> Main articles : Geography of Israel and Wildlife of Israel Geography of Israel <Ul> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> </Ul> Golan Heights Galilee Coastal plain Judaean Mountains Jordan Valley Negev Levantine Sea ( Mediterranean ) Kinneret Dead Sea Gulf of Eilat West Bank Gaza Strip Lebanon Syria Jordan Egypt Satellite images of Israel and neighboring territories during the day ( left ) and night ( right ) <P> Israel is located in the Levant area of the Fertile Crescent region . The country is at the eastern end of the Mediterranean Sea , bounded by Lebanon to the north , Syria to the northeast , Jordan and the West Bank to the east , and Egypt and the Gaza Strip to the southwest . It lies between latitudes 29 \u00b0 and 34 \u00b0 N , and longitudes 34 \u00b0 and 36 \u00b0 E . </P> <P> The sovereign territory of Israel ( according to the demarcation lines of the 1949 Armistice Agreements and excluding all territories captured by Israel during the 1967 Six - Day War ) is approximately 20,770 square kilometers ( 8,019 sq mi ) in area , of which two percent is water . However Israel is so narrow that the exclusive economic zone in the Mediterranean is double the land area of the country . The total area under Israeli law , including East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights , is 22,072 square kilometers ( 8,522 sq mi ) , and the total area under Israeli control , including the military - controlled and partially Palestinian - governed territory of the West Bank , is 27,799 square kilometers ( 10,733 sq mi ) . </P> <P> Despite its small size , Israel is home to a variety of geographic features , from the Negev desert in the south to the inland fertile Jezreel Valley , mountain ranges of the Galilee , Carmel and toward the Golan in the north . The Israeli coastal plain on the shores of the Mediterranean is home to most of the nation 's population . East of the central highlands lies the Jordan Rift Valley , which forms a small part of the 6,500 - kilometer ( 4,039 mi ) Great Rift Valley . The Jordan River runs along the Jordan Rift Valley , from Mount Hermon through the Hulah Valley and the Sea of Galilee to the Dead Sea , the lowest point on the surface of the Earth . Further south is the Arabah , ending with the Gulf of Eilat , part of the Red Sea . Unique to Israel and the Sinai Peninsula are makhteshim , or erosion cirques . The largest makhtesh in the world is Ramon Crater in the Negev , which measures 40 by 8 kilometers ( 25 by 5 mi ) . A report on the environmental status of the Mediterranean Basin states that Israel has the largest number of plant species per square meter of all the countries in the basin . </P> <H3> Tectonics and seismicity </H3> Further information : List of earthquakes in the Levant <P> The Jordan Rift Valley is the result of tectonic movements within the Dead Sea Transform ( DSF ) fault system . The DSF forms the transform boundary between the African Plate to the west and the Arabian Plate to the east . The Golan Heights and all of Jordan are part of the Arabian Plate , while the Galilee , West Bank , Coastal Plain , and Negev along with the Sinai Peninsula are on the African Plate . This tectonic disposition leads to a relatively high seismic activity in the region . The entire Jordan Valley segment is thought to have ruptured repeatedly , for instance during the last two major earthquakes along this structure in 749 and 1033 . The deficit in slip that has built up since the 1033 event is sufficient to cause an earthquake of M ~ 7.4 . </P> <P> The most catastrophic known earthquakes occurred in 31 BCE , 363 , 749 , and 1033 CE , that is every ca . 400 years on average . Destructive earthquakes leading to serious loss of life strike about every 80 years . While stringent construction regulations are currently in place and recently built structures are earthquake - safe , as of 2007 the majority of the buildings in Israel were older than these regulations and many public buildings as well as 50,000 residential buildings did not meet the new standards and were `` expected to collapse '' if exposed to a strong quake . Given the fragile political situation of the Middle East region and the presence there of major holy sites , a quake reaching magnitude 7 on the Richter scale could have dire consequences for world peace . </P> <H3> Climate </H3> K\u00f6ppen climate classification map of Israel <P> Temperatures in Israel vary widely , especially during the winter . Coastal areas , such as those of Tel Aviv and Haifa , have a typical Mediterranean climate with cool , rainy winters and long , hot summers . The area of Beersheba and the Northern Negev have a semi-arid climate with hot summers , cool winters , and fewer rainy days than the Mediterranean climate . The Southern Negev and the Arava areas have a desert climate with very hot , dry summers , and mild winters with few days of rain . The highest temperature in the continent of Asia ( 54.0 \u00b0 C or 129.2 \u00b0 F ) was recorded in 1942 at Tirat Zvi kibbutz in the northern Jordan River valley . </P> <P> At the other extreme , mountainous regions can be windy and cold , and areas at elevation of 750 meters or more ( same elevation as Jerusalem ) will usually receive at least one snowfall each year . From May to September , rain in Israel is rare . With scarce water resources , Israel has developed various water - saving technologies , including drip irrigation . Israelis also take advantage of the considerable sunlight available for solar energy , making Israel the leading nation in solar energy use per capita ( practically every house uses solar panels for water heating ) . </P> <P> Four different phytogeographic regions exist in Israel , due to the country 's location between the temperate and tropical zones , bordering the Mediterranean Sea in the west and the desert in the east . For this reason , the flora and fauna of Israel are extremely diverse . There are 2,867 known species of plants found in Israel . Of these , at least 253 species are introduced and nonnative . There are 380 Israeli nature reserves . </P> <Ul> <Li> <P> Tiberias and the Sea of Galilee </P> </Li> <Li> <P> Field of Anemone coronaria , national flower of Israel </P> </Li> <Li> <P> Makhtesh Ramon , a type of crater unique to Israel and the Sinai Peninsula </P> </Li> <Li> <P> Snow in Galilee </P> </Li> <Li> <P> Flowers of Israel </P> </Li> </Ul> <H2> Demographics </H2> Main articles : Demographics of Israel and Israelis <P> In 2017 , Israel 's population was an estimated 8,680,600 people , of whom 6,484,000 ( 74.7 % ) were recorded by the civil government as Jews . 1,808,000 Arabs comprised 20.8 % of the population , while non-Arab Christians and people who have no religion listed in the civil registry made up 4.4 % . Over the last decade , large numbers of migrant workers from Romania , Thailand , China , Africa , and South America have settled in Israel . Exact figures are unknown , as many of them are living in the country illegally , but estimates run in the region of 203,000 . By June 2012 , approximately 60,000 African migrants had entered Israel . About 92 % of Israelis live in urban areas . </P> Immigration to Israel in the years 1948 -- 2015 . The two peaks were in 1949 and 1990 . <P> Israel was established as a homeland for the Jewish people and is often referred to as a Jewish state . The country 's Law of Return grants all Jews and those of Jewish ancestry the right to Israeli citizenship . Retention of Israel 's population since 1948 is about even or greater , when compared to other countries with mass immigration . Jewish emigration from Israel ( called yerida in Hebrew ) , primarily to the United States and Canada , is described by demographers as modest , but is often cited by Israeli government ministries as a major threat to Israel 's future . </P> <P> Three quarters of the population are Jews from a diversity of Jewish backgrounds . Approximately 77 % of Israeli Jews are born in Israel , 16 % are immigrants from Europe and the Americas , and 7 % are immigrants from Asia and Africa ( including the Arab world ) . Jews from Europe and the former Soviet Union and their descendants born in Israel , including Ashkenazi Jews , constitute approximately 50 % of Jewish Israelis . Jews who left or fled Arab and Muslim countries and their descendants , including both Mizrahi and Sephardi Jews , form most of the rest of the Jewish population . Jewish intermarriage rates run at over 35 % and recent studies suggest that the percentage of Israelis descended from both Sephardi and Ashkenazi Jews increases by 0.5 percent every year , with over 25 % of school children now originating from both communities . Around 4 % of Israelis ( 300,000 ) , ethnically defined as `` others '' , are Russian descendants of Jewish origin or family who are not Jewish according to rabbinical law , but were eligible for Israeli citizenship under the Law of Return . </P> <P> The total number of Israeli settlers beyond the Green Line is over 600,000 ( \u2248 10 % of the Jewish Israeli population ) . In 2016 , 399,300 Israelis lived in West Bank settlements , including those that predated the establishment of the State of Israel and which were re-established after the Six - Day War , in cities such as Hebron and Gush Etzion bloc . In addition to the West Bank settlements , there were more than 200,000 Jews living in East Jerusalem , and 20,000 in the Golan Heights . Approximately 7,800 Israelis lived in settlements in the Gaza Strip , known as Gush Katif , until they were evacuated by the government as part of its 2005 disengagement plan . </P> <H3> Major urban areas </H3> For a more comprehensive list , see List of cities in Israel . Park Tzameret residential neighborhood in Tel Aviv . <P> There are four major metropolitan areas : Gush Dan ( Tel Aviv metropolitan area ; population 3,854,000 ) , Jerusalem metropolitan area ( population 1,253,900 ) , Haifa metropolitan area ( population 924,400 ) , and Beersheba metropolitan area ( population 377,100 ) . </P> <P> Israel 's largest municipality , in population and area , is Jerusalem with 882,652 residents in an area of 125 square kilometres ( 48 sq mi ) . Israeli government statistics on Jerusalem include the population and area of East Jerusalem , which is widely recognized as part of the Palestinian territories under Israeli occupation .

Israeli sovereignty over East Jerusalem is internationally unrecognized . </P> <H3> Language </H3> Main article : Languages of Israel Road sign in Hebrew , Arabic , and English <P> Israel has two official languages , Hebrew and Arabic . Hebrew is the primary language of the state and is spoken every day by the majority of the population . Arabic is spoken by the Arab minority , with Hebrew taught in Arab schools . </P> <P> As a country of immigrants , many languages can be heard on the streets . Due to mass immigration from the former Soviet Union and Ethiopia ( some 130,000 Ethiopian Jews live in Israel ) , Russian and Amharic are widely spoken . More than one million Russian - speaking immigrants arrived in Israel from the post-Soviet states between 1990 and 2004 . French is spoken by around 700,000 Israelis , mostly originating from France and North Africa ( see Maghrebi Jews ) . English was an official language during the Mandate period ; it lost this status after the establishment of Israel , but retains a role comparable to that of an official language , as may be seen in road signs and official documents . Many Israelis communicate reasonably well in English , as many television programs are broadcast in English with subtitles and the language is taught from the early grades in elementary school . In addition , Israeli universities offer courses in the English language on various subjects . </P> <H3> Religion </H3> Main articles : Religion in Israel and Abrahamic religions Religion in Israel <Ul> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> </Ul> Jewish Muslim Christian Druze Other . Until 1995 , figures for Christians also included Others . <P> Israel comprises a major part of the Holy Land , a region of significant importance to all Abrahamic religions -- Judaism , Christianity , Islam , Druze and Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith . </P> <P> The religious affiliation of Israeli Jews varies widely : a social survey indicates that 49 % self - identify as Hiloni ( secular ) , 29 % as Masorti ( traditional ) , 13 % as Dati ( religious ) and 9 % as Haredi ( ultra-Orthodox ) . Haredi Jews are expected to represent more than 20 % of Israel 's Jewish population by 2028 . </P> <P> Making up 17.6 % of the population , Muslims constitute Israel 's largest religious minority . About 2 % of the population is Christian and 1.6 % is Druze . The Christian population primarily comprises Arab Christians , but also includes post-Soviet immigrants , the foreign laborers of multinational origins , and followers of Messianic Judaism , considered by most Christians and Jews to be a form of Christianity . Members of many other religious groups , including Buddhists and Hindus , maintain a presence in Israel , albeit in small numbers . Out of more than one million immigrants from the former Soviet Union , about 300,000 are considered not Jewish by the Chief Rabbinate of Israel . </P> The Dome of the Rock and the Western Wall , Jerusalem . <P> The city of Jerusalem is of special importance to Jews , Muslims and Christians as it is the home of sites that are pivotal to their religious beliefs , such as the Old City that incorporates the Western Wall and the Temple Mount , the Al - Aqsa Mosque and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre . Other locations of religious importance in Israel are Nazareth ( holy in Christianity as the site of the Annunciation of Mary ) , Tiberias and Safed ( two of the Four Holy Cities in Judaism ) , the White Mosque in Ramla ( holy in Islam as the shrine of the prophet Saleh ) , and the Church of Saint George in Lod ( holy in Christianity and Islam as the tomb of Saint George or Al Khidr ) . A number of other religious landmarks are located in the West Bank , among them Joseph 's Tomb in Nablus , the birthplace of Jesus and Rachel 's Tomb in Bethlehem , and the Cave of the Patriarchs in Hebron . The administrative center of the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith and the Shrine of the B\u00e1b are located at the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed World Centre in Haifa ; the leader of the faith is buried in Acre . Apart from maintenance staff , there is no Bah\u00e1'\u00ed community in Israel , although it is a destination for pilgrimages . Bah\u00e1'\u00ed staff in Israel do not teach their faith to Israelis following strict policy . A few miles south of the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed World Centre is Mahmood Mosque affiliated with the reformist Ahmadiyya movement . Kababir , Haifa 's mixed neighbourhood of Jews and Ahmadi Arabs is the only one of its kind in the country . </P> <H3> Education </H3> Main article : Education in Israel Multidisciplinary Brain Research Center at Bar - Ilan University <P> Education is highly valued in the Israeli culture and was viewed as a fundamental block of ancient Israelites . Jewish communities in the Levant were the first to introduce compulsory education for which the organized community , not less than the parents was responsible . Many international business leaders such as Microsoft founder Bill Gates have praised Israel for its high quality of education in helping spur Israel 's economic development and technological boom . In 2015 , the country ranked third among OECD members ( after Canada and Japan ) for the percentage of 25 -- 64 year - olds that have attained tertiary education with 49 % compared with the OECD average of 35 % . In 2012 , the country ranked third in the world in the number of academic degrees per capita ( 20 percent of the population ) . </P> <P> Israel has a school life expectancy of 16 years and a literacy rate of 97.8 % . The State Education Law , passed in 1953 , established five types of schools : state secular , state religious , ultra orthodox , communal settlement schools , and Arab schools . The public secular is the largest school group , and is attended by the majority of Jewish and non-Arab pupils in Israel . Most Arabs send their children to schools where Arabic is the language of instruction . Education is compulsory in Israel for children between the ages of three and eighteen . Schooling is divided into three tiers -- primary school ( grades 1 -- 6 ) , middle school ( grades 7 -- 9 ) , and high school ( grades 10 -- 12 ) -- culminating with Bagrut matriculation exams . Proficiency in core subjects such as mathematics , the Hebrew language , Hebrew and general literature , the English language , history , Biblical scripture and civics is necessary to receive a Bagrut certificate . Israel 's Jewish population maintains a relatively high level of educational attainment where just under half of all Israeli Jews ( 46 % ) hold post-secondary degrees . This figure has remained stable in their already high levels of educational attainment over recent generations . Israeli Jews ( among those ages 25 and older ) have average of 11.6 years of schooling making them one of the most highly educated of all major religious groups in the world . In Arab , Christian and Druze schools , the exam on Biblical studies is replaced by an exam on Muslim , Christian or Druze heritage . Maariv described the Christian Arabs sectors as `` the most successful in education system '' , since Christians fared the best in terms of education in comparison to any other religion in Israel . Israeli children from Russian - speaking families have a higher bagrut pass rate at high - school level . Although amongst immigrant children born in the Former Soviet Union , the bagrut pass rate is highest amongst those families from European FSU states at 62.6 % , and lower amongst those from Central Asian and Caucasian FSU states . In 2014 , 61.5 % of all Israeli twelfth graders earned a matriculation certificate . </P> Hebrew University of Jerusalem <P> Israel has a tradition of higher education where its quality university education has been largely responsible in spurring the nations modern economic development . Israel has nine public universities that are subsidized by the state and 49 private colleges . The Hebrew University of Jerusalem , Israel 's second - oldest university after the Technion , houses the National Library of Israel , the world 's largest repository of Judaica and Hebraica . The Technion and the Hebrew University consistently ranked among world 's 100 top universities by the prestigious ARWU academic ranking . Other major universities in the country include the Weizmann Institute of Science , Tel Aviv University , Ben - Gurion University of the Negev , Bar - Ilan University , the University of Haifa and the Open University of Israel . Ariel University , in the West Bank , is the newest university institution , upgraded from college status , and the first in over thirty years . </P> <H2> Government and politics </H2> Main articles : Politics of Israel and Israeli system of government See also : Criticism of the Israeli government President Reuven Rivlin Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu The Knesset chamber , home to the Israeli parliament <P> Israel is a parliamentary democracy with universal suffrage . A member of parliament supported by a parliamentary majority becomes the prime minister -- usually this is the chair of the largest party . The prime minister is the head of government and head of the cabinet . Israel is governed by a 120 - member parliament , known as the Knesset . Membership of the Knesset is based on proportional representation of political parties , with a 3.25 % electoral threshold , which in practice has resulted in coalition governments . Parliamentary elections are scheduled every four years , but unstable coalitions or a no - confidence vote by the Knesset can dissolve a government earlier . The Basic Laws of Israel function as an uncodified constitution . In 2003 , the Knesset began to draft an official constitution based on these laws . The president of Israel is head of state , with limited and largely ceremonial duties . </P> <P> Israel has no official religion , but the definition of the state as `` Jewish and democratic '' creates a strong connection with Judaism , as well as a conflict between state law and religious law . Interaction between the political parties keeps the balance between state and religion largely as it existed during the British Mandate . </P> <H3> Legal system </H3> Main articles : Judiciary of Israel and Israeli law Supreme Court of Israel , Givat Ram , Jerusalem <P> Israel has a three - tier court system . At the lowest level are magistrate courts , situated in most cities across the country . Above them are district courts , serving as both appellate courts and courts of first instance ; they are situated in five of Israel 's six districts . The third and highest tier is the Supreme Court , located in Jerusalem ; it serves a dual role as the highest court of appeals and the High Court of Justice . In the latter role , the Supreme Court rules as a court of first instance , allowing individuals , both citizens and non-citizens , to petition against the decisions of state authorities . Although Israel supports the goals of the International Criminal Court , it has not ratified the Rome Statute , citing concerns about the ability of the court to remain free from political impartiality . </P> <P> Israel 's legal system combines three legal traditions : English common law , civil law , and Jewish law . It is based on the principle of stare decisis ( precedent ) and is an adversarial system , where the parties in the suit bring evidence before the court . Court cases are decided by professional judges rather than juries . Marriage and divorce are under the jurisdiction of the religious courts : Jewish , Muslim , Druze , and Christian . The election of judges is carried out by a committee of two Knesset members , three Supreme Court justices , two Israeli Bar members and two ministers ( one of which , Israel 's justice minister , is the committee 's chairman ) . The committee 's members of the Knesset are secretly elected by the Knesset , and one of them is traditionally a member of the opposition , the committee 's Supreme Court justices are chosen by tradition from all Supreme Court justices by seniority , the Israeli Bar members are elected by the bar , and the second minister is appointed by the Israeli cabinet . The current justice minister and committee 's chairwoman is Ayelet Shaked . Administration of Israel 's courts ( both the `` General '' courts and the Labor Courts ) is carried by the Administration of Courts , situated in Jerusalem . Both General and Labor courts are paperless courts : the storage of court files , as well as court decisions , are conducted electronically . Israel 's Basic Law : Human Dignity and Liberty seeks to defend human rights and liberties in Israel . </P> <H3> Administrative divisions </H3> Main article : Districts of Israel Districts of Israel North Haifa Center Tel Aviv Judea and Samaria Jerusalem South <Ul> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> </Ul> <P> The State of Israel is divided into six main administrative districts , known as mehozot ( \u05de\u05d7\u05d5\u05d6\u05d5\u05ea ; singular : mahoz ) -- Center , Haifa , Jerusalem , North , South , and Tel Aviv districts , as well as the Judea and Samaria Area in the West Bank . All of the Judea and Samaria Area and parts of the Jerusalem and Northern districts are not recognized internationally as part of Israel . Districts are further divided into fifteen sub-districts known as nafot ( \u05e0\u05e4\u05d5\u05ea ; singular : nafa ) , which are themselves partitioned into fifty natural regions . </P> <Table> <Tr> <Th> District </Th> <Th> Capital </Th> <Th> Largest city </Th> <Th_colspan=\"4\"> Population </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Jews </Th> <Th> Arabs </Th> <Th> Total </Th> <Th> note </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Jerusalem </Th> <Td_colspan=\"2\"> Jerusalem </Td> <Td> 7001670000000000000 \u2660 67 % </Td> <Td> 7001320000000000000 \u2660 32 % </Td> <Td> 1083300 ! 1,083,300 </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> North </Th> <Td> Nazareth Illit </Td> <Td> Nazareth </Td> <Td> 7001430000000000000 \u2660 43 % </Td> <Td> 7001540000000000000 \u2660 54 % </Td> <Td> 1401300 ! 1,401,300 </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Haifa </Th> <Td_colspan=\"2\"> Haifa </Td> <Td> 7001680000000000000 \u2660 68 % </Td> <Td> 7001260000000000000 \u2660 26 % </Td> <Td> 0996300 ! 996,300 </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Center </Th> <Td> Ramla </Td> <Td> Rishon LeZion </Td> <Td> 7001880000000000000 \u2660 88 % </Td> <Td> 7000800000000000000 \u2660 8 % </Td> <Td> 2115800 ! 2,115,800 </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Tel Aviv </Th> <Td_colspan=\"2\"> Tel Aviv </Td> <Td> 7001930000000000000 \u2660 93 % </Td> <Td> 7000200000000000000 \u2660 2 % </Td> <Td> 1388400 ! 1,388,400 </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> South </Th> <Td> Beersheba </Td> <Td> Ashdod </Td> <Td> 7001730000000000000 \u2660 73 % </Td> <Td> 7001200000000000000 \u2660 20 % </Td> <Td> 1244200 ! 1,244,200 </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Judea and Samaria </Th> <Td> Ariel </Td> <Td> Modi'in Illit </Td> <Td> 7001980000000000000 \u2660 98 % </Td> <Td> 5000000000000000000 \u2660 0 % </Td> <Td> 0399300 ! 399,300 </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> </Table> <Dl> <Dd> ^ a Including over 200,000 Jews and 300,000 Arabs in East Jerusalem . </Dd> <Dd> ^ b Israeli citizens only . </Dd> </Dl> <H3> Israeli - occupied territories </H3> Main article : Israeli - occupied territories Map of Israel showing the West Bank , the Gaza Strip , and the Golan Heights <P> In 1967 , as a result of the Six - Day War , Israel captured and occupied the West Bank , including East Jerusalem , the Gaza Strip and the Golan Heights . Israel also captured the Sinai Peninsula , but returned it to Egypt as part of the 1979 Egypt -- Israel Peace Treaty . Between 1982 and 2000 , Israel occupied part of southern Lebanon , in what was known as the Security Belt . Since Israel 's capture of these territories , Israeli settlements and military installations have been built within each of them , except Lebanon . Israel has applied civilian law to the Golan Heights and East Jerusalem and granted their inhabitants permanent residency status and the ability to apply for citizenship . The West Bank , outside of the Israeli settlements within the territory , has remained under direct military rule , and Palestinians in this area can not become Israeli citizens . Israel withdrew its military forces and dismantled the Israeli settlements in the Gaza Strip as part of its disengagement from Gaza though it continues to maintain control of its airspace and waters . </P> <P> The UN Security Council has declared the annexation of the Golan Heights and East Jerusalem to be `` null and void '' and continues to view the territories as occupied . The International Court of Justice , principal judicial organ of the United Nations , asserted , in its 2004 advisory opinion on the legality of the construction of the Israeli West Bank barrier , that the lands captured by Israel in the Six - Day War , including East Jerusalem , are occupied territory . The status of East Jerusalem in any future peace settlement has at times been a difficult issue in negotiations between Israeli governments and representatives of the Palestinians , as Israel views it as its sovereign territory , as well as part of its capital . Most negotiations relating to the territories have been on the basis of United Nations Security Council Resolution 242 , which emphasises `` the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war '' , and calls on Israel to withdraw from occupied territories in return for normalization of relations with Arab states , a principle known as `` Land for peace '' . </P> <P> According to some observers , Israel has engaged in systematic and widespread violations of human rights in the occupied territories , including the occupation itself and war crimes against civilians . The allegations include violations of international humanitarian law by the United Nations Human Rights Council , with local residents having `` limited ability to hold governing authorities accountable for such abuses '' by the U.S. State Department , mass arbitrary arrests , torture , unlawful killings , systemic abuses and impunity by Amnesty International and others and a denial of the right to Palestinian self - determination . In response to such allegations , Prime Minister Netanyahu has defended the country 's security forces for protecting the innocent from terrorists and expressed contempt for what he describes as a lack of concern about the human rights violations committed by `` criminal killers '' . Some observers , such as Israeli officials , scholars , United States Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley and UN secretary - generals Ban Ki - moon and Kofi Annan , also assert that the UN is disproportionately concerned with Israeli misconduct . </P> Israeli West Bank barrier separating Israel and the West Bank <P> The West Bank was occupied and annexed by Jordan in 1950 , following the Arab rejection of the UN decision to create two states in Palestine . Only Britain recognized this annexation and Jordan has since ceded its claim to the territory to the PLO . The population are mainly Palestinians , including refugees of the 1948 Arab -- Israeli War . From their occupation in 1967 until 1993 , the Palestinians living in these territories were under Israeli military administration . Since the Israel -- PLO letters of recognition , most of the Palestinian population and cities have been under the internal jurisdiction of the Palestinian Authority , and only partial Israeli military control , although Israel has on several occasions redeployed its troops and reinstated full military administration during periods of unrest . In response to increasing attacks during the Second Intifada , the Israeli government started to construct the Israeli West Bank barrier . When completed , approximately 13 % of the barrier will be constructed on the Green Line or in Israel with 87 % inside the West Bank . </P> <P> The Gaza Strip was occupied by Egypt from 1948 to 1967 and then by Israel after 1967 . In 2005 , as part of Israel 's unilateral disengagement plan , Israel removed all of its settlers and forces from the territory . Israel does not consider the Gaza Strip to be occupied territory and declared it a `` foreign territory '' . That view has been disputed by numerous international humanitarian organizations and various bodies of the United Nations . Following the 2007 Battle of Gaza , when Hamas assumed power in the Gaza Strip , Israel tightened its control of the Gaza crossings along its border , as well as by sea and air , and prevented persons from entering and exiting the area except for isolated cases it deemed humanitarian . Gaza has a border with Egypt and an agreement between Israel , the European Union and the PA governed how border crossing would take place ( it was monitored by European observers ) . </P> <H3> Foreign relations </H3> Main articles : Foreign relations of Israel and International recognition of Israel Diplomatic relations Diplomatic relations suspended Former diplomatic relations No diplomatic relations , but former trade relations No diplomatic relations <P> Israel maintains diplomatic relations with 158 countries and has 107 diplomatic missions around the world ; countries with whom they have no diplomatic relations include most Muslim countries . Only three members of the Arab League have normalized relations with Israel : Egypt and Jordan signed peace treaties in 1979 and 1994 , respectively , and Mauritania opted for full diplomatic relations with Israel in 1999 . Despite the peace treaty between Israel and Egypt , Israel is still widely considered an enemy country among Egyptians . Under Israeli law , Lebanon , Syria , Saudi Arabia , Iraq , Iran , Sudan , and Yemen are enemy countries , and Israeli citizens may not visit them without permission from the Ministry of the Interior . Iran had diplomatic relations with Israel under the Pahlavi dynasty but withdrew its recognition of Israel during the Islamic Revolution . As a result of the 2008 -- 09 Gaza War , Mauritania , Qatar , Bolivia , and Venezuela suspended political and economic ties with Israel . </P> <P> The United States and the Soviet Union were the first two countries to recognize the State of Israel , having declared recognition roughly simultaneously . The United States regards Israel as its `` most reliable partner in the Middle East , '' based on `` common democratic values , religious affinities , and security interests '' . The United States has provided $68 billion in military assistance and $32 billion in grants to Israel since 1967 , under the Foreign Assistance Act ( period beginning 1962 ) , more than any other country for that period until 2003 . The United Kingdom is seen as having a `` natural '' relationship with Israel on account of the British Mandate for Palestine . Relations between the two countries were also made stronger by former prime minister Tony Blair 's efforts for a two state resolution . By 2007 , Germany had paid 25 billion euros in reparations to the Israeli state and individual Israeli Holocaust survivors . Israel is included in the European Union 's European Neighbourhood Policy ( ENP ) , which aims at bringing the EU and its neighbours closer . </P> <P> Although Turkey and Israel did not establish full diplomatic relations until 1991 , Turkey has cooperated with the Jewish state since its recognition of Israel in 1949 . Turkey 's ties to the other Muslim - majority nations in the region have at times resulted in pressure from Arab and Muslim states to temper its relationship with Israel . Relations between Turkey and Israel took a downturn after the 2008 -- 09 Gaza War and Israel 's raid of the Gaza flotilla . Relations between Greece and Israel have improved since 1995 due to the decline of Israeli - Turkish relations . The two countries have a defense cooperation agreement and in 2010 , the Israeli Air Force hosted Greece 's Hellenic Air Force in a joint exercise at the Uvda base . The joint Cyprus - Israel oil and gas explorations centered on the Leviathan gas field are an important factor for Greece , given its strong links with Cyprus . Cooperation in the world 's longest sub-sea electric power cable , the EuroAsia Interconnector , has strengthened relations between Cyprus and Israel . </P> <P> Azerbaijan is one of the few majority Muslim countries to develop bilateral strategic and economic relations with Israel . Azerbaijan supplies Israel with a substantial amount of its oil needs , and Israel has helped modernize the Armed Forces of Azerbaijan . India established full diplomatic ties with Israel in 1992 and has fostered a strong military , technological and cultural partnership with the country since then . According to an international opinion survey conducted in 2009 on behalf of the Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs , India is the most pro-Israel country in the world . India is the largest customer of the Israeli military equipment and Israel is the second - largest military partner of India after Russia . Ethiopia is Israel 's main ally in Africa due to common political , religious and security interests . Israel provides expertise to Ethiopia on irrigation projects and thousands of Ethiopian Jews live in Israel . </P> <H3> International humanitarian efforts </H3> <P> Israeli foreign aid ranks low among OECD nations , spending less than 0.1 % of its GNI on development assistance , as opposed to the recommended 0.7 % . The country also ranked 43rd in the 2016 World Giving Index . However , Israel has a history of providing emergency aid and humanitarian response teams to disasters across the world . Israel 's humanitarian efforts officially began in 1957 , with the establishment of Mashav , the Israel 's Agency for International Development Cooperation . There are additional Israeli humanitarian and emergency response groups that work with the Israel government , including IsraAid , a joint programme run by 14 Israeli organizations and North American Jewish groups , ZAKA , The Fast Israeli Rescue and Search Team ( FIRST ) , Israeli Flying Aid ( IFA ) , Save a Child 's Heart ( SACH ) and Latet . </P> <P> Between 1985 and 2015 , Israel sent 24 delegations of IDF search and rescue unit , the Home Front Command , to 22 countries . In Haiti , immediately following the 2010 earthquake , Israel was the first country to set up a field hospital capable of performing surgical operations . Israel sent over 200 medical doctors and personnel to start treating injured Haitians at the scene . At the conclusion of its humanitarian mission 11 days later , the Israeli delegation had treated more than 1,110 patients , conducted 319 successful surgeries , delivered 16 births and rescued or assisted in the rescue of four individuals . Despite radiation concerns , Israel was one of the first countries to send a medical delegation to Japan following the 2011 earthquake and tsunami disaster . Israel dispatched a medical team to the tsunami - stricken city of Kurihara in 2011 . A medical clinic run by an IDF team of some 50 members featured pediatric , surgical , maternity and gynecological , and otolaryngology wards , together with an optometry department , a laboratory , a pharmacy and an intensive care unit . After treating 200 patients in two weeks , the departing emergency team donated its equipment to the Japanese . </P> <H3> Military </H3> Main articles : Israel Defense Forces and Israeli security forces Further information : List of wars involving Israel , List of the Israel Defense Forces operations , and Israel and weapons of mass destruction <P> The Israel Defense Forces is the sole military wing of the Israeli security forces , and is headed by its Chief of General Staff , the Ramatkal , subordinate to the Cabinet . The IDF consist of the army , air force and navy . It was founded during the 1948 Arab -- Israeli War by consolidating paramilitary organizations -- chiefly the Haganah -- that preceded the establishment of the state . The IDF also draws upon the resources of the Military Intelligence Directorate ( Aman ) , which works with Mossad and Shabak . The Israel Defense Forces have been involved in several major wars and border conflicts in its short history , making it one of the most battle - trained armed forces in the world . </P> Israeli soldiers armed with Tavor X95s . <P> Most Israelis are drafted into the military at the age of 18 . Men serve two years and eight months and women two years . Following mandatory service , Israeli men join the reserve forces and usually do up to several weeks of reserve duty every year until their forties . Most women are exempt from reserve duty . Arab citizens of Israel ( except the Druze ) and those engaged in full - time religious studies are exempt from military service , although the exemption of yeshiva students has been a source of contention in Israeli society for many years . An alternative for those who receive exemptions on various grounds is Sherut Leumi , or national service , which involves a program of service in hospitals , schools and other social welfare frameworks . As a result of its conscription program , the IDF maintains approximately 176,500 active troops and an additional 445,000 reservists . </P> Iron Dome is the world 's first operational anti-artillery rocket defense system . <P> The nation 's military relies heavily on high - tech weapons systems designed and manufactured in Israel as well as some foreign imports . The Arrow missile is one of the world 's few operational anti-ballistic missile systems .

The high annual incident solar irradiance at its geographic latitude creates ideal conditions for what is an internationally renowned solar research and development industry in the Negev Desert . Israel had a modern electric car infrastructure involving a countrywide network of charging stations to facilitate the charging and exchange of car batteries . It was thought that this would have lowered Israel 's oil dependency and lowered the fuel costs of hundreds of Israel 's motorists that use cars powered only by electric batteries . The Israeli model was being studied by several countries and being implemented in Denmark and Australia . However , Israel 's trailblazing electric car company Better Place shut down in 2013 . </P> <H3> Transportation </H3> Main article : Transport in Israel Reception hall at Ben Gurion Airport <P> Israel has 19,224 kilometres ( 11,945 mi ) of paved roads , and 3 million motor vehicles .

It became a symbol of the Zionist reconstruction and of the ability to experience joy amidst austerity . It now plays a significant role in modern Israeli folk dancing and is regularly performed at weddings and other celebrations , and in group dances throughout Israel . Modern dance in Israel is a flourishing field , and several Israeli choreographers such as Ohad Naharin and Barak Marshall and many others , are considered to be among the most versatile and original international creators working today .

Hotel restaurants are much more likely to serve kosher food . The non-kosher retail market was traditionally sparse , but grew rapidly and considerably following the influx of immigrants from the post-Soviet states during the 1990s .

United Nations Security Council Resolution 478 ( 20 August 1980 ; 14 -- 0 , U.S. abstaining ) declared the Jerusalem Law `` null and void '' and called on member states to withdraw their diplomatic missions from Jerusalem . The United Nations and all member nations refuse to accept the Jerusalem Law ( see Kellerman 1993 , p. 140 ) and maintain their embassies in other cities such as Tel Aviv , Ramat Gan , and Herzliya ( see the CIA Factbook and Map of Israel ) . The U.S. Congress subsequently adopted the Jerusalem Embassy Act , which said that the U.S. embassy should be relocated to Jerusalem and that it should be recognized as the capital of Israel . However , the US Justice Department Office of Legal Counsel concluded that the provisions of the act `` invade exclusive presidential authorities in the field of foreign affairs and are unconstitutional '' . Since passage of the act , all presidents serving in office have determined that moving forward with the relocation would be detrimental to U.S. national security concerns and opted to issue waivers suspending any action on this front . The Palestinian Authority sees East Jerusalem as the capital of a future Palestinian state . The city 's final status awaits future negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority ( see `` Negotiating Jerusalem , '' Palestine -- Israel Journal ) . See Positions on Jerusalem for more information . </Li> <Li> ^ Jump up to : The majority of the international community ( including the UN General Assembly , the United Nations Security Council , the European Union , the International Criminal Court , and the vast majority of human rights organizations ) considers Israel to be occupying Gaza , the West Bank and East Jerusalem . Gaza is still considered to be `` occupied '' by the United Nations , international human rights organisations , and the majority of governments and legal commentators , despite the 2005 Israeli disengagement from Gaza , due to various forms of ongoing military and economic control . The government of Israel and some supporters have , at times , disputed this position of the international community . For more details of this terminology dispute , including with respect to the current status of the Gaza Strip , see International views on the Israeli - occupied territories and Status of territories captured by Israel .

'' The struggle , as the Arabs saw it , was about the fate of Palestine / the Land of Israel , all of it , not over this or that part of the country . But , in public , official Arab spokesmen often said that the aim of the May 1948 invasion was to `` save '' Palestine or `` save the Palestinians , '' definitions more agreeable to Western ears .

Israel claims it no longer occupies the Gaza Strip , maintaining that it is neither a Stale nor a territory occupied or controlled by Israel , but rather it has ' sui generis ' status . Pursuant to the Disengagement Plan , Israel dismantled all military institutions and settlements in Gaza and there is no longer a permanent Israeli military or civilian presence in the territory . However the Plan also provided that Israel will guard and monitor the external land perimeter of the Gaza Strip , will continue to maintain exclusive authority in Gaza air space , and will continue to exercise security activity in the sea off the coast of the Gaza Strip as well as maintaining an Israeli military presence on the Egyptian - Gaza border . and reserving the right to reenter Gaza at will . Israel continues to control six of Gaza 's seven land crossings , its maritime borders and airspace and the movement of goods and persons in and out of the territory . Egypt controls one of Gaza 's land crossings . Troops from the Israeli Defence Force regularly enter pans of the territory and / or deploy missile attacks , drones and sonic bombs into Gaza . Israel has declared a no - go buffer zone that stretches deep into Gaza : if Gazans enter this zone they are shot on sight . Gaza is also dependent on israel for inter alia electricity , currency , telephone networks , issuing IDs , and permits to enter and leave the territory . Israel also has sole control of the Palestinian Population Registry through which the Israeli Army regulates who is classified as a Palestinian and who is a Gazan or West Banker . Since 2000 aside from a limited number of exceptions Israel has refused to add people to the Palestinian Population Registry . It is this direct external control over Gaza and indirect control over life within Gaza that has led the United Nations , the UN General Assembly , the UN Fact Finding Mission to Gaza , International human rights organisations , US Government websites , the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office and a significant number of legal commentators , to reject the argument that Gaza is no longer occupied . </Li> <Li> Scobbie , Iain ( 2012 ) .

Even after the accession to power of Hamas , Israel 's claim that it no longer occupies Gaza has not been accepted by UN bodies , most States , nor the majority of academic commentators because of its exclusive control of its border with Gaza and crossing points including the effective control it exerted over the Rafah crossing until at least May 2011 , its control of Gaza 's maritime zones and airspace which constitute what Aronson terms the ' security envelope ' around Gaza , as well as its ability to intervene forcibly at will in Gaza . </Li> <Li> Gawerc , Michelle ( 2012 ) . Prefiguring Peace : Israeli - Palestinian Peacebuilding Partnerships . Lexington Books . p. 44 . ISBN 9780739166109 . While Israel withdrew from the immediate territory , Israel still controlled all access to and from Gaza through the border crossings , as well as through the coastline and the airspace . ln addition , Gaza was dependent upon Israel for water electricity sewage communication networks and for its trade ( Gisha 2007 . Dowty 2008 ) . ln other words , while Israel maintained that its occupation of Gaza ended with its unilateral disengagement Palestinians -- as well as many human right organizations and international bodies -- argued that Gaza was by all intents and purposes still occupied . </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ See for example : * Hajjar , Lisa ( 2005 ) .

Although the basic philosophy behind the law of military occupation is that it is a temporary situation modem occupations have well demonstrated that rien ne dure comme le provisoire A significant number of post-1945 occupations have lasted more than two decades such as the occupations of Namibia by South Africa and of East Timor by Indonesia as well as the ongoing occupations of Northern Cyprus by Turkey and of Western Sahara by Morocco . The Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories , which is the longest in all occupation 's history has already entered its fifth decade . </Li> <Li> ^ Jump up to : Adriana Kemp , `` Labour migration and racialisation : labour market mechanisms and labour migration control policies in Israel '' , Social Identities 10 : 2 , 267 -- 292 , 2004 </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ `` Israel '' .

Albert of Aachen does not mention the date in a clear manner either . From what he says , it appears that it was mainly the Jewish inhabitants of the city who defended the fortress of Haifa . In his rather strange Latin style , he mentions that there was a Jewish population in Haifa , and that they fought bravely within the walls of the city . He explains that the Jews there were protected people of the Muslims ( the Fatimids ) . They fought side by side with units of the Fatimid army , striking back at Tancred 's army from above the walls of the citadel ( ... Judaei civis comixtis Sarracenorum turmis ) until the Crusaders overcame them and they were forced to abandon the walls . The Muslims and the Jews then managed to escape from the fortress with their lives , while the rest of the population fled the city en masse . Whoever remained was slaughtered , and huge quantities of spoils were taken .

The blockade closed Israel 's sea lane to East Africa and the Far East , hindering the development of Israel 's southern port of Eilat and its hinterland , the Nege . Another important objective of the Israeli war plan was the elimination of the terrorist bases in the Gaza Strip , from which daily fedayeen incursions into Israel made life unbearable for its southern population . And last but not least , the concentration of the Egyptian forces in the Sinai Peninsula , armed with the newly acquired weapons from the Soviet bloc , prepared for an attack on Israel .

The compromise , therefore , was to choose constructive ambiguity : as surprising as it may seem , there is no law that declares Judaism the official religion of Israel . However , there is no other law that declares Israel 's neutrality toward all confessions . Judaism is not recognized as the official religion of the state , and even though the Jewish , Muslim and Christian clergy receive their salaries from the state , this fact does not make Israel a neutral state . This apparent pluralism can not dissimulate the fact that Israel displays a clear and undoubtedly hierarchical pluralism in religious matters ... It is important to note that from a multicultural point of view , this self - restrained secularism allows Muslim law to be practiced in Israel for personal matters of the Muslim community . As surprising as it seems , if not paradoxical for a state in war , Israel is the only Western democratic country in which Sharia enjoys such an official status . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Sharot , Stephen ( 2007 ) . `` Judaism in Israel : Public Religion , Neo-Traditionalism , Messianism , and Ethno - Religious Conflict '' .

ISBN 978 - 1 - 4129 - 1195 - 5 . It is true that Jewish Israelis , and secular Israelis in particular , conceive of religion as shaped by a state - sponsored religious establishment . There is no formal state religion in Israel , but the state gives its official recognition and financial support to particular religious communities , Jewish , Islamic and Christian , whose religious authorities and courts are empowered to deal with matters of personal status and family law , such as marriage , divorce , and alimony , that are binding on all members of the communities . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Jacoby , Tami Amanda ( 2005 ) .

Although there is no official religion in Israel , there is also no clear separation between religion and state . In Israeli public life , tensions frequently arise among different streams of Judaism : Ultra-Orthodox , National - Religious , Mesorati ( Conservative ) , Reconstructionist Progressive ( Reform ) , and varying combinations of traditionalism and non-observance . Despite this variety in religious observances in society , Orthodox Judaism prevails institutionally over the other streams . This boundary is an historical consequence of the unique evolution of the relationship between Israel nationalism and state building ... Since the founding period , in order to defuse religious tensions , the State of Israel has adopted what is known as the ' status quo , ' an unwritten agreement stipulating that no further changes would be made in the status of religion , and that conflict between the observant and non-observant sectors would be handled circumstantially . The ' status quo ' has since pertained to the legal status of both religious and secular Jews in Israel . This situation was designed to appease the religious sector , and has been upheld indefinitely through the disproportionate power of religious political parties in all subsequent coalition governments ... On one hand , the Declaration of Independence adopted in 1948 explicitly guarantees freedom of religion . On the other , it simultaneously prevents the separation of religion and state in Israel . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Englard , Izhak ( Winter 1987 ) . `` Law and Religion in Israel '' .
