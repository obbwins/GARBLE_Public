To create a NSGA-II (Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II) algorithm, you need to follow the algorithm's pseudo-code or actual implementation based on the document sources provided. The NSGA-II is an evolutionary multi-objective optimization algorithm. Here's a simplified outline of how you can implement the NSGA-II algorithm based on the provided document references:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Initial Population**: Start by generating an initial random population. The population size is usually denoted by 'n'.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Non-Dominated Sorting**: Perform non-dominated sorting on the population to classify members into fronts. A solution 'p' dominates 'q' if 'p' is no worse than 'q' in all objectives, and 'p' is better than 'q' in at least one objective. Ranking the population in this way results in an array of fronts.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Crowding Distance**: Assign each solution a crowding distance, which is a measure of the \"density\" of solutions surrounding it in the objective space. Larger distances mean more crowded regions.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Selection**: Select parents for the next generation from the current population based on their ranks and crowding distances. Typically, a tournament selection process is used, where pairs of solutions compete, and higher-ranked solutions with a larger crowding distance are more likely to win.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Crossover and Mutation**: Apply genetic operators like crossover and mutation to create offspring from the selected parents.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Replacement**: Replace the current population with the offspring, ensuring the population size remains equal. During replacement, there are a few strategies:\n",
      "   - Preserve the best individuals of the current population.\n",
      "   - Ensure that every individual from the previous generation is included in the new population.\n",
      "   - Prefer new offspring if they are non-dominated and have a larger crowding distance.\n",

      "4. Partition the population: Partition the population into segments, where each segment contains solutions ranked the same. For each segment, create a front by selecting the best solution and then choosing the best solutions in increasing order of crowding distance.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Create the offspring population: Apply elitism, recombination, and mutation operators to generate the offspring population from the selected segments.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Evaluate the offspring population: Assess the fitness of the offspring population using the same objective functions as the parent population.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Merge populations: Combine the parent and offspring populations. The newly formed population may be of different size (parent population + offspring population).\n",
      "\n",
      "8. Rank and select: Sort the combined population again based on the new ranks and crowding distances. If the rank size is less than or equal to a predefined number, the best selected solutions are added to the new population. Otherwise, select the solutions with the top ranks and highest crowding distances.\n",
